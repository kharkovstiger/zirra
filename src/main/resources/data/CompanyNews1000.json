Since that time, all four companies have launched -- or are in the middle of launching -- significant new initiatives.\nAdvertising, of course, plays a big role in each of these products. According to eMarketer's projections, advertisers are expected to spend $15.6 billion in online advertising in 2006. That's an increase of about 50 percent over 2005, when the entire online ad market was worth about $10 billion. \nBASELINE DATA\n2005 Revenue: $6.14 billion (up 92.4% from 2004)\n2005 Unique Visitors: 94.6 million per month averaging 32.3 minutes on sites\nYahoo:\n2005 Revenue: $5.26 billion (up 47.1% from 2004)\n2005 Unique Visitors: 120 million per month averaging 244.9 minutes on sites\nMicrosoft:\n2005 Revenue: $39.79 billion (up 8% from 2004)\n2005 Unique Visitors: 110.4 million unique visitors averaging 176 minutes on sites\nAOL:\n2005 Revenue ( Time Warner )\n2005 Unique Visitors: ???\nSEARCH -- In April Google gained in search market share for the ninth consecutive month, according to ComScore.\nGoogle Search: powered by Google.

TripSay combines travel search with user-generated travel guides and ratings. When you enter a city or place, it comes up on a map, along with recommendations from other TripSay users that can be sorted by restaurants, hotels, bars, beaches, transportation, sights, and other categories. I described the service in my initial review:\nTripSay combines social recommendations with a travel search engine that auto-suggests cities, pubs, hotels, and the like as you type them in. They appear as icons on a map, with a photo (pulled from Flickr) and description on the side, a tag cloud below, and minifeed of all the places you and your friends have rated or recommended.  The detail page for each city shows other TripSay members who have visited, tips from members, the most interesting Flickr photos tagged with the name of the city, links elsewhere on the Web, and a list of the top-rated places shown on a map.\nSince then, the site has added a few more features, including better editing tools, ways to collect and save your favorite tips, group message boards, and the ability to filter recommendations by groups. And, of course, it’s kept its signature rating system, which goes from smiley face to a full moon. TripSay competes with Dopplr , Driftr , and many other social travel sites, but it is worth a look.\n", "deleted" : false }

To tell a search engine you want a news article, you have to type a few words into the search on your phone or laptop. To tell Siri or Google Now that you need a map or a phone number, you have to hold down a button first.\nBut they’re just machines—why should we have to get their attention? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Why aren’t our devices listening to us all the time, ready to respond the moment we need them?\nWell, in fact, they’re starting to do this. Google’s new Moto X phone , which goes on sale this week, contains a low-power chip whose only job is to listen for the phrase “Okay Google Now,” which alerts the device to turn your next words into a command or a search query.\nBut that’s a small step—in a way, it just substitutes a trigger phrase for a button-push. Soon, your phone or laptop may be able to go much farther: tracking everything you say; searching for related personal data or Web resources; and showing the results to you proactively, just in case you’re interested.\nAt least, that’s the vision at Expect Labs . The San Francisco startup, which is backed by an array of high-profile investors like Samsung, Google Ventures, Telefonica, Intel, Liberty Global, IDG, and Greylock, is pushing a concept it calls “anticipatory computing”—and sooner or later, it’s likely to become part of everyone’s computing experience.\n“In just a few years, the search engine on your phone is not going to be waiting around to be asked questions,” says founder and CEO Tim Tuttle. “You want it to pay attention continuously when something is happening in your life, so that it can anticipate your question before you pull your phone out of your pocket.”\nSet aside, if you can, the fact that the National Security Agency may also want to pay attention continuously—and that a world where computers can anticipate our every need would, in effect, be a world of total electronic surveillance. That’s a privacy tradeoff that each individual consumer will have to consider carefully, in light of this summer’s revelations about the startling scope of the federal government’s eavesdropping programs.\nExpect Labs’ MindMeld app shows results relating to a conversation about restaurants in San Francisco.\nThe thing you really need to understand about Tuttle and his crew at Expect Labs, who aim to release a showcase mobile app called MindMeld this fall, is that they don’t care so much about whether their software can answer questions or respond to commands, the way “virtual personal assistants” like Siri or Google Now can. Those tasks come down to speech recognition, semantics, and grammar. Most of the computing cycles involved go toward figuring out what the user meant and responding appropriately, not developing a bigger picture of the user’s context.\nAnticipatory computing, in Tuttle’s world, is completely different. He says it’s about using signals and data from your devices to construct “a model that represents what is happening in your life,” then taking a more-is-better approach, “proactively searching across all the data sources you care about.” It’s about statistics, relationships, and educated guesses.\n“If you have the ability to listen all the time, it dramatically improves usability, because then you can talk to your computer the same way you talk to a person, where you assume they are up to speed on what they’ve heard,” Tuttle says. “That’s what we are building toward.”\nThe MindMeld app for the iPad and Android tablets will demonstrate the whole idea in the context of teleconferencing. The app works like Skype or any other Voice-over-IP app, except that it’s constantly listening to your side of the conversation in the background and showing a series of appointments, contacts, Web clips, news articles, and other resources related to whatever you’re talking about. Say you’re calling friends to invite them over for dinner, and the conversation veers toward food choices. MindMeld might hear you mention Italian food and show a recipe for fettuccine Alfredo.\nBut as cool as that sounds, Expect doesn’t expect to stay in the app business. MindMeld is designed mainly just to demonstrate the capabilities of the company’s underlying “Anticipatory Computing Engine.” The real show will get started later this year when Expect Labs gives outside programmers access to the APIs, or application programming interfaces, that will let them use the engine to power their own apps. In other words, Expect Labs wants to provide the smarts that make other companies’ software anticipatory, whether that software is being used by smartphone owners, call-center employees, or drivers in connected cars.\nExpect Labs was formed in 2011 by a team of researchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford, “most of whom have PhDs in statistical search, natural language understanding, and speech recognition,” according to Tuttle. After getting his own computer-science PhD at MIT, Tuttle came west to found Bang Networks, a content distribution network for real-time data, and then Truveo, a video search engine acquired by AOL in 2006.\nThe insight that grabbed Tuttle, within a couple of years after he left AOL in 2008, was that “search is becoming conversational, real-time, driven by speech and language as a key input.” Smartphones and tablets were the main drivers of this change. “These devices are with us all the time and have access to all sorts of sensor data, including live audio and video,” Tuttle says he realized. “Those could become the inputs to let an intelligent discovery engine find you want you need.”\nTuttle assembled a group of computer geniuses (including former Nexidia researcher Marsal Gavaldà, machine learning expert Simon Handley, DNAnexus and scalable computing veteran Pete Kocks) and set to work building that engine. In its current form, the Expect platform has three main functions: First, it analyzes the signals coming in from a user’s device: audio, video, GPS, and more. Second, it uses these signals to … Next Page »\nWade Roush is a contributing editor at Xconomy. Follow @wroush\n", "deleted" : false }

Shrek and other characters from the movie will be added to the Scrapblog Virtual Marketplace to allow users to add stickers, backgrounds and themes to scrapbooks.\nScrapblog, which raised $2.5 millio n from Disney’s Steamboat Ventures earlier this year, offers an online editor that allows users to decorate their scrapbook with text, images, colorful themes, and other embellishments, which can then be shared on the web or printed out. Scrapblog recently brought on a new CEO, Jill Braff , to lead the company after startup’s founder and CEO Carlos Garcia, stepped aside.\nThe startup is also launching a new product to its printed offerings: a 12” x 12” square glossy hardcover scrapbook. The company was first introduced back in 2006, briefly went offline , and relaunched in March 2007.\nAccording to Compete, Scrapblog only had 84,000 unique visitors in September. The online scrapbooking space is tough considering that Flickr, Apple iPhoto and other popular photo sharing sites now offer high-end scrap booking options for consumers. But the scrapbook business could be a $2 billion market, and with potential acquisitions.

In the first half of 2015, this figure amounted to 204,300 units. Affected by lower oil prices, the sales volume of electric vehicles in Japan and the United States declined while that in China and Europe maintained faster growth. \nIn 2014, the global demand for Li-ion power battery for electric vehicles came to 9.8GWh, up 87% from a year earlier, of which the demand from passenger vehicles totaled 7.3GWh and commercial vehicles 2.5GWh. In H1 2015, the global demand for EV Li-ion power battery hit 7GWh, maintaining high growth \nAt present, manganese-series power battery, including NCM and LMO, occupies the mainstream status on a global scale, with the cost of battery packs generally standing at USD400-550/kWh, which reflects an obvious decline since 2014. The cylindrical NCA 18650 battery produced through coiling, though lower costs for its cells, is popular with automakers due to high BMS costs and safety; Similarly, because of poor comprehensive performance, low-cost LFP battery is only is used in China and the United States. However, the US automakers have gradually abandoned LFP batteries and turned to ternary materials-based and Mn-series batteries from Japanese and S. Korean companies. When it comes to the development trends in Li-ion power battery technology, passenger vehicles will mainly adopt manganese series and ternary materials-based batteries while commercial vehicles will primarily use LFP batteries and gradually turn to ternary materials-based batteries. \nAt present, no major technological breakthrough has not yet been made in power battery. It is estimated that the drop in prices for power battery mainly resulted from a fall in the costs of raw materials and economies of scale, but with a limited decline. \nIn 2014, China's power battery shipments totaled 3.7GWH, up 470% from a year earlier. Among them, the demand for passenger vehicle power batteries was 1.6GWh and that for commercial vehicles 2.1GWh. In H1 2015, China's power battery shipments came to 2.72GWh. As battery electric buses showed explosive growth in the second half of 2015, and if we calculate the new energy vehicle output based on 250,000 units for the full year, the corresponding battery demand will reach 11 GWh. \nAs far as Chinese Li-ion power battery manufacturers are concerned, in H1 2015, any of such companies as BYD, Guoxuan, ATL, Tianjin Lishen, OptimumNano, Boston Power, and Pride Battery has a battery output of 100MWH. The shipments of 13 major battery manufacturers accounted for an aggregate 71% in market share, of which BYD had the largest market share of 17%. \nFrom the perspective of global trends, the support from big carmakers is vital to power battery manufacturers. Traditional consumer electronics companies are aggressively conducting transformation. On the other hand, battery materials manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers have also begun to enter this field through various ways. Thus, the first echelon represented by BYD, Guoxuan, Tianjin Lishen, and ATL and the second echelon including OptimumNano, Boston Power, and Pride Battery, BESK, Do-Fluoride Chemicals, CALB, and Shenzhen BAK have taken shape. \nKey Topics Covered: \n1.

In contrast, OTT video continues its strong    growth, and should see around 26% total revenue growth in 2015, with 24%    CAGR through 2019. With the growing popularity of independent OTT    services, such as Netflix and HBO Go, customers are starting to demand a    similar experience from their pay TV subscriptions, including features    such as content search and recommendation and mobile device support.    “Comparatively high priced pay TV bundles are losing customers to more    inexpensive, IP-delivered content,” says Eric Abbruzzese, Research    Analyst. Operators can combat this with rollouts of new STB technologies    that utilize IP-capable hardware to deliver similar experiences to those    third-party OTT services. “Operators that are first to market with new    set-top box technologies can expect strong returns—as much as 10% higher    ARPU than with legacy technology—while those introducing the technology    later will struggle to see similar success.” Properly supporting    multiscreen features has become nearly compulsory with the    ever-increasing focus on mobile device usage, and is more easily done as    these more advanced IP-enabled STBs are released.\nPay TV providers can also look to pay TV Lite services to attract new    customers as well as expand their current footprint. Standalone OTT    services, such as Dish Network’s Sling TV and BSkyB’s Sky Go, offer live    and on-demand content separate from a pay TV subscription, which allows    more choice and competition in TV services, as well as allows operators    to enter new geographies without incurring major costs for    infrastructure expansion (seen with ViaSat’s expansion into Eastern    Europe and Dish Network’s nationwide coverage with Sling TV). This    potential expansion also helps to balance the financial risks associated    with developing a new OTT product.\nThose that have already embraced these ideas—notably Comcast, Dish    Network, Liberty Global, and BSkyB—are on track to see future growth in    a slowly declining market. Operators that are passive in embracing OTT    face the challenge of maintaining subscriber counts even within their    dedicated and satisfied customer base, while contending with other    subscribers leaving in favor of progressive options. “While pay TV will    continue to hold market majority going forward, the best chance for    positive growth in the pay TV space lies in the implementation of OTT    capability in both standalone and IP-enabled STB capacities,” concludes    Abbruzzese.\nThese findings are part of ABI Research’s OTT    and Multiscreen Services Market Research ( https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/service/ott-and-multi-screen-services/ ).\nABI Research provides in-depth analysis and quantitative forecasting of    trends in global connectivity and other emerging technologies.

A cobbler from a remote village in Cyprus, it must have seemed strange settling in to Melbourne’s industrial west. Job options were limited if you couldn’t speak the language, so he went to work in the factories. At first the Standard Motor Company and then the Ford factory in Broadmeadows.\nEven with the long hours he worked it was a struggle to keep the family afloat. The only luxury he allowed himself was a shot of brandy after dinner. But like many migrants he was aspirational – especially for his children. He wanted them to get educated and do well in the world. After all, that’s why he set out for the lucky country.\nThe world has changed since 1953, and I often wonder what my grandfather would have done had he arrived today. What opportunities would he have, what doors once shut would now be open.\nFor a start he could have learned English. Not knowing it always held him back. I remember my Dad telling me that at the age of eight he was translating tax returns that my grandfather couldn’t understand. It must have been disempowering for a parent to be so reliant on their kids for such basic things. \nHad Charlie arrived in Australia today, he could access English lessons for free on DuoLingo , then hop on over to Livemocha and start practicing. He could even search ‘language swap’ on Gumtree and meet a conversation partner for a face-to-face chat at Starbucks.\nAnd what if he wanted a different job than the factory grind. He could jump onto uDemy , Lynda and Skillshare to build bankable skills for about $50 a month. He might have taken to coding, or design, or architecture. With a little effort, he could find work beyond Broadmeadows through Seek and LinkedIn. His new CV would be built on Google Docs with a free template from the gallery.\nAnd even if he chose to work from home and spend more time with the kids, he could still find work from around the world with Freelancer.com . He’d use Skype for communication, Dropbox for storage, and Trello to manage his projects. And if he wanted to get out of the house, he could escape to a café with decent wifi using Workfrom.co .\nBut perhaps the biggest opportunity for my grandfather, if he were coming to Australia today, could be found in entrepreneurship. Had he wanted to start a business, there would be no better time than now. He might have kept it simple with a Shopify store, selling brandy from all over the world through Google Adwords and Facebook Ads , just like this guy did with wine.\nOr he could have stuck with his trade, selling custom leather shoes on Etsy or through a website built with freelancers in a couple of days. He could take payments through Stripe and use Olark for live customer support.\nIf money was tight, Charlie could turn to Pozible or Kickstarter for funding, and VentureCrowd when things started to take off. He could even coordinate a product launch for a new range of buffalo leather boots with Eventbrite , build a loyal following through Facebook, and set up a WordPress blog to teach shoemaking. Of course he would definitely run a Meetup group for fans of bespoke shoes, keeping his community engaged and excited with updates on Hootsuite and Mailchimp .\nYes, my grandfather’s talents and ideas and dreams could touch and enrich so many more people today than they could in 1953. And because of the Internet, the reverse is also true. I can imagine him subscribing to podcasts from This American Life , following Elon Musk on Twitter or reading Aeon and learning and deciding who he is and how he fits in with this world.\nIt’s true, the Internet disrupts and it disassembles. It destroyed Borders and Blockbuster and Britannica and more. But it also equalises access to opportunity. It democratises the knowledge and tools of entrepreneurship. It can be a leg up for the underdog, not only enabling them to find work or build a business, but also do something they believe in.

Not because they ran out of money, but because Hercules Technology Growth Capital , one of their backers, had seized the company and was shutting it down.\nCEO Scott Cahill confirmed the shutdown yesterday in an email to investors, saying that Hercules had “foreclosed on its collateral and has sold the company’s intellectual property to a third party”:\nFrom: “Cahill, Scott”\nDate: Wed, 3 Jun 2009 16:42:29 -0400\nTo:\nSubject: Final Kadoink Update\nDear Angel Investor:\nThis is the final update on Kadoink. On Friday, May 30th, Kadoink completed the sale of its assets. As the attached letter indicates, the company contacted over 600 parties to determine interest in an acquisition of the company’s assets. Of those, 22 expressed interest. Following a due diligence period, the Company received 6 bids for the acquisition of the Company’s intellectual property. Unfortunately, the highest offer was insufficient to pay the company’s secured lender in full. The company’s secured lender, Hercules Technology II, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. has foreclosed on its collateral and has sold the company’s intellectual property to a third party. While the details of the transaction between Hercules and the buyer are subject to a confidentiality provision, the company can assure investors that the purchaser is not an insider and the transaction was arms-length.\nThe Company’s inability to pay its secured creditor in full means that that the Company, with certainty, is unable to make any payments on the general unsecured claims against it. Additionally, investors will receive no return on their investment. The company will be dissolved under state law. Please consult with your tax advisor regarding how you, or your organization, should handle losses arising from the closure of the company.\nOn a final note, I regret that we were unable to return at least some portion of your investment to you.  While we were optimistic at the start of the process that this might be achievable and we were ultimately satisfied with the size of the top bidders given what we learned over time regarding sales such as ours, it is disappointing nonetheless.\nI wish you all the best in your future endeavors and investments.\nBest Regards,\nScott\nVenture debt looks extremely attractive when things are going well for a startup. The dilution to shareholders is minimal, usually just some warrants attached to the debt. It can make a lot of sense to raise debt when building out infrastructure, particularly since the debt can be secured against hardware being purchased.\nBut the terms of the debt are key, particularly under what circumstances the creditor can come in and shut down the company. Many creditors look for triggers in the financial statements that give them the right to seize assets. That’s likely what happened with Kadoink, and it’s a sad way to end a company that may still have a shot at doing something interesting. Smart entrepreneurs only accept debt agreements that require nothing but payments to be made on time. As long as those payments come in, the creditor has to stay away. Terms are usually less attractive, but in the end it may save you from the deadpool .\n", "deleted" : false }

According to the Experian Holiday Shopping Survey, 60 percent of adults say holiday shopping puts a big strain on their finances.\n\"We have Black Friday, then dark January,\" said Rod Griffin, director of public education at Experian. Consumers tend to find themselves trying to dig themselves out of debt and get back on track financially in the new year. This is typically because they spend more than they expect to during the holidays and use credit to fund their shopping.\nIf you exceeded your holiday shopping budget, racked up debt and depleted your savings, you can bounce back. Here are 10 steps you can take to get your finances back in shape in the new year.\n1. Review Your Holiday Spending\nThe first step you should take after the holidays is to review all of your spending, said Bruce McClary, spokesperson for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Look at how much you charged to credit cards, how much you spent from savings and the categories you were spending on — such as gifts, food and entertainment. \"It gives you a good starting point to get out of debt and rebuild savings,\" McClary said.\n2. Make a Plan to Tackle Debt\nPlenty of consumers will be digging out of debt in the new year. Those surveyed by Experian expected to charge about a quarter of their holiday spending to a credit card. To quickly eliminate that debt, you need a plan.\n\"The worst thing you can ever do is plan to pay the minimum payments,\" said McClary. \"That debt may be around for the next holiday season, and may be in the way of planned purchases and activities.\"\nIdeally, you should aim to pay off your credit card balance in one to two months, he said. If you owe money on more than one credit card, he recommended using one of these two strategies: tackling the smallest balance first or paying off the card with the highest interest rate. \"The process that is most motivating is the one that you should go with,\" said McClary.\nYou might need to tighten your belt to wipe out your debt quickly. \"Look at everyday spending to find ways to cut back to contribute more to debt repayment,\" said Bethy Hardeman, chief consumer advocate at Credit Karma. You can also put yourself on a cash-only diet so you don't rack up more debt as you're trying to pay it off.\n3. Put Extra Cash Toward It\nIn addition to cutting back, look for ways to generate more cash in the new year to pay off your debt, or to rebuild savings you might have tapped to cover holiday spending. The first place to look for extra money is in your paycheck.\nTwo-thirds of human resource and hiring managers said their company plans to give holiday bonuses this year, with the average bonus expected to be $858, according to a survey by Accounting Principals. Given that consumers surveyed by Experian said they planned to spend an average of $806 over the holidays, a bonus of that size could easily replenish depleted savings or knock out holiday debt.\nIf you loaded up on gifts this holiday season, you can make room for your new things by selling some older items online, said Farnoosh Torabi, a personal finance expert and Chase Slate financial education partner. \"This will not only help declutter your space, [but] you can earn some extra cash to help pay down that December credit card balance.\"\nYou can sell clothing and accessories at sites such as Thredup.com and Tradesy.com, which get a commission for reselling your items. Or you could try listing items for sale on Craigslist.\n4. Set up Automated Payments\nNearly a quarter of adults surveyed by Experian said they've paid holiday shopping credit card charges late. Not only will you get hit with fees if you pay your credit card bills late, but your credit score will take a hit, according to the NFCC.\nTorabi said you can avoid making late payments by setting up automated payments through your bank or card issuer. Apps such as Mint Bills can also send you reminders when bills are due.\nIf you plan to skip a payment because you can't afford to pay your bill, McClary said you should call your credit card company first to see what remedies you can find together while your account is in good standing. \"If you have good credit, there are plenty of options to give yourself some breathing room so your credit score doesn't take a hit,\" he said.\n5. Transfer Balances\nHere's an easy money tip to follow: If you have good credit, lower the cost of your holiday debt by transferring balances to a low-rate card. You often can get a 0 percent rate on balance transfers for 12 to 18 months, which can reduce the amount of interest you'll pay on your debt.\nBe sure you read the fine print, though, before accepting a balance transfer offer. Most balance transfer cards have waived interest, which means you'll pay interest only on any remaining balances that haven't been paid off at the end of the introductory period. However, deferred interest offers require that you pay interest on the entire amount you transferred if you don't pay the balance in full by the end of the introductory period, Hardeman said.\n6. Develop a Support Network\nYou won't be the only one needing help getting your finances back on track after the holidays, Torabi said. So team up with someone else in a similar position to share your goals and keep each other accountable. \"Hitting the reset button on your finances is more manageable and fun with the help of a friend,\" she said.\nSome people even create bill-paying clubs — similar to book clubs — to get together with others in debt to talk about the progress they're making and offer support to one another, Griffin said.\n7. Seek Professional Help\nIf you're really struggling to pay off the debt you owe, or need help getting your finances back on track, get advice from a nonprofit credit counselor. \"Don't be afraid to seek help,\" Griffin said. It won't affect your credit score or credit history, but it can help you manage debts, he said. You can find counselors at NFCC.org.\nAlso consider meeting with a counselor if you tapped savings that were earmarked for things other than holiday spending. \"If you're raiding your short-term emergency savings or long-term retirement savings, there's a bigger issue about priorities,\" McClary said.\n8. Avoid Quick Fixes\nEven if your debt seems overwhelming, you should avoid companies that promise to help you settle debts for pennies on the dollar of what you owe. \"It's very tempting, but it's also probably illegal,\" Griffin said.\nDebt-settlement firms might charge an upfront fee before providing any services. But Griffin said that firms promising credit repair have to fulfill the terms of their offer before taking any money.\n9. Monitor Your Credit\nHoliday shopping has negatively affected the credit scores of 10 percent of consumers, according to the Experian survey. So it's important to see where you stand by reviewing your credit report. Griffin said your score should include risk factors that are affecting your score and what areas you should focus on to help build your credit.\nAnother reason to monitor your credit report and your credit accounts closely after the holidays is to look for signs of fraud. If you see any unauthorized charges on your statement, contact your credit card issuer immediately to cancel your card and dispute the charges. Check your credit report for accounts you don't recognize, which could be a sign that someone has used your identity to get credit in your name.\nYou can sign up for free credit monitoring at a site such as Credit Karma, which will notify you if there are changes to your credit score or report. Or you can pay for a service such as Experian's ProtectMyID, Identity Guard and LifeLock to monitor your credit, public records and other data points for suspicious uses of your identity.\n10. Start Saving for Next Year\nHelp yourself avoid a holiday debt hangover next year by saving money throughout the year. Add up all of your holiday spending, and divide that total by 10 to determine how much you should set aside each month from January to October. That can help you save enough for when the holiday shopping season starts in November, McClary said.\nIf that monthly amount is too high, create a strategy to have a more affordable holiday season next year, he said. As you follow these steps to bounce back, try to stay positive.\n\"Patience is key — don't get discouraged,\" McClary said. \"You do have time to get back on track. It's a matter of devoting enough time to sit down and create a roadmap.\"\n", "deleted" : false }

The world order is very far still from my 2007 vision: Web 3.0 = (4C + P + VS) . Nonetheless, read on to learn about some very interesting developments in the industry.\nSramana Mitra: Let’s start by introducing our audience to yourself as well as to Zmags.\nBrian Rigney: I’m the CEO of Zmags. I joined Zmags just about two years ago. My background before that has been a series of startups including companies like CashStar that does digital commerce through gift cards and other applications.\nSramana Mitra: That’s a Maine company right?\nBrian Rigney: That is a Maine company, yes. You can find them at CashStar.com.\nSramana Mitra: We’ve done their story. I know Dave.\nBrian Rigney: He asked me to join as a co-founder. I consulted before he raised any money. Then I joined formally as the eighth employee, and helped to grow its customers from just Home Depot and a few others to over 250 retailers and banks including J.P. Morgan, Walmart, GAP and many others. I have also helped advise a series of companies both publicly and privately held to help them into new spaces and new markets. These include companies like WEX, which is a fleet fueling card.\nThen I also was the Founder and CEO of a company called BlueTarp Financial, which is one of the first digital commerce companies that I started back in 1999 and ran for the next six and a half years. Think of them as a commerce payments technology platform. They’re both the issuer of the BlueTarp accounts and the acquirer of merchants. They service both the merchant and the cardholder.\nSramana Mitra: What is Zmags?\nBrian Rigney: Zmags is a privately held company owned by the Gores Group, which is a private equity fund based out of California. Zmags is a SaaS-based company that offers two products. The first is called Publicator that allows someone to upload a PDF and convert that into a richer, more engaging, online experience. It includes commerce. Our newest product is called Creator. That’s what we’re most excited about. Creator is a SaaS-based patform as well that allows e-commerce marketers to create rich, engaging content, and then deploy that to their website without any coding.\nToday, you can start off wanting to create a new experience for your website. You could create it the next 30 minutes. Five minutes after that, it could go live with animation and multiple images. It doesn’t require anyone to do any coding. Zmags’ classic entrepreneur story started in Copenhagen in 2006 as someone’s idea during college. He wanted to raise some venture capital and expand to the North American market. He opened up a headquarters office here in Boston in the 2008 to 2009 time frame. He raised some venture money.\nA new vision came into play. That vision was bold. They tried to execute against that over the next three years. Ultimately, it was too bold. They had some early buy-ins and success with signing on customers but the challenges and the technology limitations at that time did not make it possible to achieve their vision. In early 2013, the company was put up for sale. In December 2013, the Gores Group came in to take a look at it. The company was acquired formally in January of 2014.\n", "deleted" : false }

Eli is also a mentor for Techstars in LA.\nAdvisory boards get a bad rep, and most of them deserve it. They are generally nothing more than head shots on a slide deck — impressive people who “validate” that the company is interesting. But advisory boards can and should be so much more.\nOver the last two companies I have co-founded, advisors played an outsized role in whatever success we have had. They have helped me think through tough problems, fill-in knowledge gaps, made key introductions, and generally made me smarter and better. The only thing they haven’t done is validate our business.\nI think the problem with advisory boards comes down to how CEOs approach them. They look for the big names, like the CEOs with multiple hundred million dollar exits, the luminaries in the field, and the well-known personalities. This sounds like a good idea, but is it really helpful?\nPerceived Benefits of a Big Name\nFirst of all, it feels terrific when someone who’s “made it” thinks what you are doing is great. I’ve been there. You’re hands down working so hard, being questioned all the time, going through the typical ups and painful downs of a startup, and one day this super important person says they like your business. Not only that, but they want to be involved. This feels like a stamp of approval you can take to investors, employees, and even to let your friends know that you aren’t absolutely crazy. I don’t underestimate the little ego wins in startups to maintaining sanity, but does it really help the company? My experience is that almost no sophisticated investor (or recruit or partner or customer) pays too much attention to your advisor slide, probably because you are giving them equity for free. Investors actually have to pay for their equity.\nThe second argument for a big shot advisor is that they must be incredibly smart and know a lot more about how to make your business successful than you. Their advice is going to be gold!\nMaybe, but in general big shots are pretty removed from the day to day of building a company and almost certainly not the expert you are in what you are trying to do. I am betting that they will likely learn more from you than you will from them.\nThe other reason why I don’t believe impressive advisors provide that much help is that they are generally extremely busy and don’t have the time to dive deep with you on your business.\nA third rationale for getting a high profile advisor is that they are generally very well connected and will open doors for you. This could be huge, but you need to make sure that you set expectations. I’ve seen it many times where an advisor agrees to join a board, but then is reluctant to tap into his or her personal network.\nWhat Makes a Great Advisory Board\nIn my opinion, a great advisory board is a set of people who make you better. Being a startup CEO is a very difficult job, you have an ever evolving organization, an ever changing set of problems, and an ever increasing set of new challenges. You are constantly doing things you have never done before. Scaling from 5 to 10 people, hiring a VP of Sales, raising a Series A, selling to a new market, signing a multi-year BD contact, sponsoring your first conference, firing a senior executive, dealing with your first PR fiasco. A CEO needs a stable of advisors he or she can turn to to get quick help.\nSo what should you look for?\nSubject Matter Expertise\nDue to the multitude of areas a CEO needs to be competent in, it helps to find advisors that fill in your knowledge gaps. If you’ve never sold or built a sales team, find a CRO advisor rather than a CEO. Yes, CEO’s have dealt with sales teams, but the subject matter expertise is going to reside with a CRO. Find the people who are experts at solving a set of problems you have, bring them on, and turn to them whenever you have issues related to that problem.\nDuring my time at Thinknear, I needed to sell to agencies. I had never sold anything – let alone sold ads to a media buyer — and I was really struggling. I brought on Stu Libby as an advisor. He was an acting CRO selling every day into media agencies and he helped me quickly get up to speed — giving me advice on my deck, how to talk to agencies, what things mattered. I was soon selling millions of dollars.\nAnother quick example: we were building an AdTech focused product but felt like we were missing some of the subtle elements that mattered in this new industry. We convinced Nat Turner to join our advisory board as he was considered one of the very best product people in AdTech (and had just sold Invite Media to Google). He quickly helped us understand the nuances of the customer and how to build the right products for them.\nIn addition to industry and functional-level advisors, I think every startup CEO should also have one advisor for CEO-specific issues, like boards and fundraising. Having someone to turn to who understands the nuances of being a startup CEO is critical, but I think more than one is overkill.\nAdvisors Who Can Commit The Time\nOnce you’ve identified the areas that you want to hire advisors for, you need to gauge their willingness to commit time. Be upfront about your expectations and only bring on people who will really give you the time you need. I typically put in my advisory agreement a minimum of one meeting/call every other week, and one lunch or dinner a quarter. As soon as they join I set up a recurring meeting and I am aggressive to make sure I get my time.\nTeachers\nWhen I interview advisors I am always trying to get a sense for how well they will be able to teach me what they know.\nBeing a subject matter expert isn’t enough if all they know is how to do, but not how to teach me to do. I am not hiring advisors to actually do the work, only to advise me so I can do the work. So after affirming that they are in fact subject matter experts, most of what I try to suss out is if they are deep thinkers who can externalize their expertise and pass it on.\nA Final Note: Firing Advisors\nNo one bats 1000 when building an advisory board. Some advisors just don’t provide as much value as they intended or don’t live up to the promised time commitment. It is incredibly uncomfortable, but if someone isn’t pulling their weight you cannot dilute the rest of the shareholders by continuing to give them equity. I suggest all advisory agreements vest equity over two years so that if it isn’t working the two parties can part ways.\nConclusion\nAdvisory boards can be an entrepreneur’s secret weapon — giving you access to a group of experts who help you solve problems you would have had to spend years figuring out on your own.

Pebble Will Release Proof-Of-Concept Watchface SDK In Early April\nWhat do you do when you have a health question? You likely either search Google or WebMD, try to call your doctor, or set up an appointment. For most people, the latter two options would be preferable, because, after all, you’re more likely to trust a human being than Dr. Robot or some crowdsourced health resource.\nOf course, visits to the doctor’s office will cost ya. Oh, will they cost you — both your patience and your wallet. In 2010, Wellsphere’s Ron Gutman founded HealthTap to leverage the scalable distribution afforded by the web to connect you with real, live human doctors in realtime — for free.\nWhen I first heard the idea, I pictured a dark call center filled with ill-kept quacks giving questionable medical advice to the ailing masses. But HealthTap has been on a mission to buck the WebMD trend for health databases and become the web’s go-to repository for health info that’s actually reliable.\nNot only that, but HealthTap’s real success has been its “Quora for doctors” — the Q&A portion of the platform that allows anyone and everyone to ask a health question and have one of the 35,000 licensed, U.S. physicians in its network (which also includes 128 specialties in all 50 states) respond to their question. The difference with Quora, Gutman tells us, is that all of HealthTap users’ questions get answered within 24 hours. Quora is a terrific resource, but anyone familiar with the platform knows it can be hopeless in this regard.\nThanks to its Q&A network, which provides patients with near-same-day answers to their health questions, the Eric Schmidt-backed startup has been growing fast. However, HealthTap has yet to give much of a peek behind the curtain, but today we’ve managed to convince Ron to share a little more about the startup’s growing traction.\nThe founder tells us that people are now asking doctors more than 10 million questions on HealthTap every month and that the site is serving more than 7.5 million unique visitors each month, with its mobile apps having been downloaded by more than 2 million. But what’s really encouraging for HealthTap is that doctors are excited about it and spending time interacting with the platform. “They actually want to take the time to answer people’s questions,” Gutman says. Which, admittedly, was not what he expected — at least to this degree.\nAs of now, doctors are spending an average of over one hour per session (61.2 minutes to be precise) each time they log in. They’re not only answering questions, but engaging in peer reviews of other doctors’ answers, building transparent referral networks and voting on one another’s expertise. (HealthTap is far from being the first to go after these concepts, by the way, as Doximity, QuantiaMD and many others will attest.)\nCumulatively, HealthTap has served more than 581 million answers to users seeking health advice from their mobile devices and browsers. But, what really makes a difference is that over the past five months, 2,963 people have sent HealthTap thank-you notes saying that these doctor answers had saved their lives. Whether you buy into HealthTap’s concept or not, if someone were to ask you why healthtech is important, this is it.\nBut, for HealthTap, though it may sound like vapid cheerleading, it’s hard not to admit that this growth is impressive having launched its beta less than two years ago and its mobile health platform eight months ago. The platform has added more context around its Q&A platform, creating an interactive “Health Journey” so that all topics on the platform are now connected through a network of semantic relationships, doctors and interactive images, along with creating a repository of wellness topics and doctor-created tips.\nAs Obamacare incentivizes more people to go to the doctor’s offices, those aforementioned lines are only going to get longer and doctors are going to be inundated by more people than they can handle. “The more we can create mechanisms that help make doctors more efficient and reduce wait times while saving people money? “That’s a win,” Gutman says.\nHealthTap has to date raised $13.9 million from investors including Esther Dyson, Mark Leslie, Aaron Patzer, Mohr Davidow Ventures and Mayfield fund. What’s more, based on this growth, we’ve also been hearing that HealthTap is in the process of raising a substantial Series B. So stay tuned.\n", "deleted" : false }

The search technology compresses data using bit map indexes . A bitmap index data structure allows for data to be read very fast as it resides in-memory. The data is stored in columns, which is better for analytical purposes, and focuses on fast response times and parallel processing. The company’s targeted use cases are customers that have huge amounts of data that is imported continuously just once and not changed afterwards. Web analytics, fraud prevention, online advertising, telco billing, smart metering and sensor network data analysis are all examples of potential use cases.\nParStream is a counter of sorts to other big data analytics providers. Interestingly, it does not use Hadoop, the distributed analytics file system. CEO Joerg Bienert said the data requirements are just too much with Hadoop. “It’s not great for real-time analytics,” Bienert said.\nInstead, due to the compression it does, ParStream analyzes smaller pieces of data to get the analysis in real-time.\nPar Stream is a likely acquisition target as it competes with HP’s Vertica and EMC’s Greenplum, both of which were once independent companies.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

But fear over a worsening consumer advertising sentiment, plus excitement about a new wave of ad outcomes, may mean the industry is only just beginning.\n\"Most advertising today isn't relevant,\" according to Quantcast CEO Konrad Feldman, whose company measures web audiences. \"It doesn't have to be that way.\"\nFeldman sees a parallel with another online business that, once, was nascent but which has certainly now grown up.\n\"Think about our experience with search,\" he tells Beet.TV. \"Whenever we conduct a search, most of the results that come back are relevant and useful to us. That demonstrates the power of data and technology. Web search is only 20 years old. The same opportunity exists for all other forms of media.\"\nLooking beyond what digital ads look, feel and perform like today is only natural. Despite growing to represent the largest-grossing ad medium in many countries now, online ads are suffering from audience aversion and often plummeting effectiveness. It's no wonder a smorgasbord of ad-tech vendors is claiming to bring a whole new, more upbeat paradigm shift to a gloomy sector.\nFor Feldman, that will come not from rerouting existing ad practices through programmatic channels but in the ability to crunch data en masse, better targeting to achieve better relevance.\n\"The much larger opportunity is how we make advertising relevant for consumers and drive better outcomes by using data and technology modify content in real-time,\" he says. \"It's still quite early.\"\n \nThis video was recorded at the 4A's Transformation conference in Miami.   For additional interviews,  please visit this page .

Proximic says these solutions are already baked into several publishers and ad tech platforms, including AppNexus.\nWPP, one of the most ad tech-involved holding companies in the world, appears to be one of the winners standing in the shadows of comScore’s Proximic purchase.

Measuring – monitor traffic to your business site(s) and gain access to aggregated demographic and behavioral statistics from MOLI members who visit your site;\nAdvertisement\n5.

Everything he touches seems only to implode. This happened to E-Trade back in 2000-2002 when he was the CEO. Cotsakos was famously replaced after enriching himself with a $78 million pay package during a year the stock tanked 53 percent (see chart detail at left). He had to give back some of that money, but kept enough to live lavishly in Florida and pour millions of dollars into an ill-conceived social network for international swingers called Moli .\nNever heard of Moli? Don’t worry. It also just imploded. Moli was a me-three social network that was founded in 2006 way after that train had left the station, and didn’t launch publicly until January 2008 at DEMO . The main differentiating factor, if you can call it that, was the ability to show different profiles to different sets of contacts (personal, business, family). The site never got above 2.5 million visitors a month, according to Compete (see chart above). And we have learned from several former employees that most of its staff has been laid off, from a peak employment of about 55.\nThere was a big round of layoffs last September, when all but 15 or so people were let go. Last week, most of the remaining employees were cut loose. The site is still up, but it seems like there are only a handful of people left keeping the lights on hoping for a sale. That is unlikely to happen. We are placing Moli in the deadpool . (And something tells me many more social networks are headed there as well).\nAlthough the company (officially called Mainstream Holdings) reportedly raised a total of $56 million, including $30 million just last January, one source tells us that most of that money was never actually disbursed to the company. And in fact investors from the $30 million round, which included Wall Street billionaire Kenneth Langone and Home Depot founder Bernard Marcus, refused to release the second tranche of funds after the stock market started to go south. That led to the September firings.\nReally, anyone could have seen this coming a mile away: A no-name social network run out of Florida, backed by a guy known primarily for his greed—what did the investors think was going to happen? Oh wait, I forgot, Kenneth Langone is a big believer in greed . The business model, apparently, was to sell deep profile and targeting information to advertisers. The problem was that Moli needed users before it could sell their personal information. The company also sold e-commerce tools to subscribers so that users could try to sell things to their friends. Hmm, I wonder why nobody wanted to hang out there.\nToday, nobody picks up the phone at the West Palm Beach headquarters. And e-mails to company executives, including to president Judy Balint, go unanswered. The site seems to be sponsored by SECFilings.com.\nHere are some screen shots for posterity:\n", "deleted" : false }

The company recently announced the addition of LinkedIn and scheduling status updates to be pushed to various social platforms using Ping.fm, a quick way to push an update to all of social networking sites.\nHooSuite’s upgraded platform gives users the ability to not only develop and push social messages to social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn all from one location, but also allows them to gain a better understanding of the audience that the messages are reaching. The company is calling the upgraded features a “Social CRM” tool and says it is targeting marketers, news networks and music labels looking to have a better understanding of its online audience and be able to track multiple campaigns. More specifically, the tool will look at the audiences influence, reach, activity levels and what techniques work best to interact with the social influencers who might follow a company and digest its messages.\nThe upgraded features also give insight into which messages are resonating best through tracking URLS using Ominture and Google Analytics, analytic tools that can track link usage and give added insight into outreach. Through this, marketers might be able to tweak and update outgoing messaging as well as prep for responses to tracked customer online responses.\nHootSuite is entering a well-funded and saturated market of companies offering tracking and managing services. Just last month, social media marketing company Sway landed $2 million to launch its Shoutlet platform to help marketers figure out which social campaigns are working best . In addition, Visible Technologies recently grabbed $22 million in fourth round funding to continue to promote its TruCast platform that’s also helps marketers track and manage social campaigns.\nWhile HootSuite claims its differentiators are features targeted for marketing campaigns used by multiple users across several networks through desktop and mobile applications, the reality is that the majority of the competitors in the space offer the same features, including the recenlty funded companies above.\nBased in Vancouver, HootSuite was founded in 2008 by Invoke Media and is used by popular companies such as Dell, Disney, the NBA and FOX, according to its website.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPress Releases\n", "deleted" : false }

Following their departure, it was unclear what would happen to Jangl’s assets and remaining staff. Now we hear from multiple sources close to the deal that Live Universe has agreed to acquire both.\nThis appears to conclude the Jangl saga that started late last fall. Around that time, Jangl’s board began telling the founders to pursue an acquisition strategy in lieu of raising more money. The board’s decision came even when the company had closed deals (some profitable) with several partners, including Plentyoffish and Tagged.\nWe hear there was a disconnect between the VCs, who had a more enterprise background, and Jangl’s executives, who were set on developing a consumer-facing brand. The founders, and Michael Cerda in particular, are said to have worked diligently to carry out the board’s marching orders. But despite many companies showing interest in Jangl, it struggled to find the right company for its exit.\nAn acquisition deal (apparently with WhitePages.com) came close but unraveled after the terms changed and became far less acceptable. With no apparent options left, much of the company’s staff was notified that they would probably have to find new work, and it was finally announced that Jangl’s founders were indeed jumping ship.\nJust what Live Universe plans to do with everything they left behind has yet to be seen. I’m sure Jangl’s partners will be interested in hearing the fate of their agreements, if they haven’t already.\n", "deleted" : false }

The company states that, \"We regret to inform you that Spotplex is going offline. This was a very hard decision for us and we are sure you will miss the service as much as we do.\"\nI wrote about Spotplex , back in November after having a conversation with their CEO, Doyon Kim (previously founded Dialpad, which sold to Yahoo 2005). At the time, I expressed concerns with the way that their site operates. In order for the content from a site to be included on Spotplex, the publisher of that content had to install a code snippit on their site, which also tracked analytics. The most trafficked stories were then displayed on Spotplex's homepage. I think that this restriction severely limited the amount of content that was included on the site, thus drastically reducing its value. This may not have been the best approach, in comparison to sites like Digg and Techmeme which rely on community input and not publisher participation.\nTechCrunch is reporting that the reason for Spotplex's shuttering is \"lack of adequate funding.\" Whether that means that they failed to find additional investors for the startup or that their money was poorly managed is unclear right now. I tend to think that the lack of funding might be attributed to the site not catching on as well as expected.\nThere is no doubt that Spotplex had talented and experienced people behind it, but, in my opinion, there were some key flaws in the site's core functionality, which really hurt them in the end.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

Somewhere along the way, it also turned into an Alexa-like analytics service. Unfortunately, neither market worked out for them and they’ve been forced to shut their doors.\nThe Digg-style service used JavaScript that was embedded on participating pages to track how often posts were read, and top-read posts were featured on Spotplex’s homepage. The service set itself apart from Digg by requiring no intervention on the reader’s part to promote a page. On the other hand, Spotplex only recorded hits on blogs that had embedded the Javascript snippets, which severely restricted its sources of content.\nSpotplex’s JavaScript embeds were also used to offer an analytics service that was designed to contend with sites like Alexa and Compete. While the addition of this service marked a shift to a very different market, both of Spotplex’s services leveraged the same backend.\nCEO Doyon Kim says that the company’s ultimate failure was due to a lack of adequate funding. The company underestimated the resources that were required to build and maintain its service, and it neglected to seek venture funding after its $450,000 seed round. This is surprising given Kim’s experience in the industry: he co-founded DialPad , which was acquired by Yahoo in 2005.\nSpotplex is now in the TechCrunch Deadpool .\n", "deleted" : false }

It competes with products from companies like Zenoss, Solarwinds, IBM, HP and CA.\nThe “hybrid” market\nAbout three years ago, Link saw the cloud computing trend and revamped his product to work especially well with Amazon’s cloud. (Today, it also works with Microsoft Azure and clouds built using VMware’s software, too.)\nHis goal was to tackle what’s known today as “hybrid” computing. That’s when companies put part of their IT into the cloud while keeping part in their own data centres.\nMany businesses plan to operate in a hybrid forever. Others find that once they try cloud computing, they like it and want to eventually unplug all of their data centres for the cloud. But they will still be “hybrid” for a few years, the time it takes them to move.\nAs you might imagine, it can be complicated to manage a hybrid setup, with apps, data and systems spread out all over. And this is especially true if a company uses more than one cloud (which many do).\nScienceLogic helps them watch, and even find, all of their IT assets. Its claim to fame is that it’s incredibly detailed, Link tells us.\nA dotcom survivor\nScienceLogic is also a dream-come-true for Link.\nBefore founding ScienceLogic, he had been working for a web hosting company that didn’t survive the dotcom bubble. It was his job to buy all of the data center equipment and systems monitoring tools. He and his two ScienceLogic cofounders (who still run ScienceLogic with him) spent the first year of the company programming the initial product in his basement.\n“I was a buyer of these products, and I didn’t like the way the marketplace was treating me,” he told Business Insider. “We didn’t build this company to build it and flip it. We wanted to solve a problem near and dear to our hearts.”\nThe company was bootstrapped for its first seven years before landing its first $15 million in venture funding from NEA in 2010. It then landed Intel and Goldman Sachs as investors and, all told, raised $84 million, with a $45 million round from Goldman Sachs about a year ago, before the funding bubble burst.\n“We’ll be cash-flow positive second half of this year,” he says. “I’m so happy to be sitting here now, feeling smarter than I should because we took more funding than we needed.”\nAn IPO is the eventual goal, he concedes, but that will have to wait until the public market regains its tech IPO appetite again.\nIn the meantime, thanks in large part to Amazon, business is good.\nIn addition to tripling bookings last year, ScienceLogic will grow its employee base from 270 to about 350 people in 2016, with offices in Europe, Hong Kong and Singapore and it has 25,000 customers worldwide.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through hispersonal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn\nTagged In\n", "deleted" : false }

More on that in a minute (as well as a relevant video clip from The Office), but first a note on a new scandal brewing.\nIn the past few weeks, we’ve received a number of complaints about MediaMax, the troubled file storage site that lost vast amounts of its users’ files last summer. It seems that the company has once again stepped between its users and their data, though this time it was intentional.\nThe site (which was formerly known as Streamload) has decided to relaunch as The Linkup , a social networking site based around storage (yes, you read that right). As part of the transition, MediaMax chose to disable access to all of their free accounts. Users were given two options: either pony up $6 a month to continue having access to your files, or download them before they deleted your account.\nUnfortunately, it seems that many users never got the message. The company says that it notified its users through email, but given the number of people that unexpectedly lost access to their files, it seems that these warnings weren’t enough.\nFrom one disgruntled user :\nAbout notification: they say they did, but it must have gone into spam. I have saved spam for more than a month, but there is no mail from them. Also, all the previous mails like email notification and changes passwords always arrive in my inbox, why should their email go in spam? They are lying openly.\nIf you were on a free account, and you haven’t downloaded your files yet, you’re screwed. They’re gone.\nOh yeah, if you did decide to go with the Pro account, you’re also out of luck for the time being. The company is apparently having difficultly getting files transferred between MediaMax and The Linkup, and the files probably won’t be available until late June (The Linkup launched on May 10 – that’s nearly two months of downtime).\nhttp://www.hulu.com/embed/3u5SiWkVlhBGZYzZi-SB3w/257/315\nThose fearless users who aren’t too concerned with having access to their files should try out The Linkup, “The social network for file sharing.” Why do we need a social network around cloud storage and file sharing? The Office gives us the answer: “its all about creating a one stop consumer experience.”\n", "deleted" : false }

If you want to cash in the biggest checks, you have to:\nStep 1: Become a killer programmer or big data expert.\nStep 2: Move to the West Coast.\nSee also: 10 Programming Languages You Should Learn Right Now\nMost of the highest paying jobs are, naturally, in the root of tech innovation in Silicon Valley . This is also among the most expensive cost-of-living areas in the nation. A few up-and-coming tech hubs, like nearby San Francisco, Seattle and even Silicon Beach down in Southern California made it on the list as well.\nFolks who know how to handle, parse and analyze an overwhelming amount of data will get the fattest paychecks in 2015 — three of the five highest paid jobs are centered on big data. We dug into the CyberCoders database of hundreds of thousands of job postings to find the average salaries of technology-related jobs. Here are the highest paying jobs and the cities in which they're located.\n1. Data Scientist | $150,000 | Seattle, Washington\nData scientists are some of the most expensive and coveted professionals around today. \"It’s important to note that data mining as it relates to data science is not traditionally taught in university-level computer science curricula,\" says Ray Bao , data scientist at CyberCoders .\nWhile there are new, in-demand programs, like UC Berkley’s Masters of Info and Data Science, \"oftentimes, what is taught in academia pales in complexity to real-world problems,\" Bao says.\nSo what’s the path to becoming a money-making data science expert? This infographic by Data Camp breaks down the typical background and necessary hard skills: According to the graphic, the core set of skills you need to learn centers heavily on statistics and mastering the appropriate programming tools, including Python and R, as well as database querying language SQL.\nBut that’s not all; data science requires deep analytical thinking and creativity. Data scientists should be able to not only solve complex problems through data mining but also ask the right questions to extract meaningful conclusions about the data, Bao says.\nBao suggests subscribing to Revolution Analytics to stay abreast of using open source R for big data analysis in addition to browsing Stack Overflow to learn and help other developers.\n2. Data Engineer | $148,000 | Mountain View, California\nWhile data scientists are charged with extracting meaning from massive amounts of data, data engineers are usually experts in formatting datasets, which enables other folks or stakeholders to analyze that data.\n\"They will likely work with Hadoop, MapReduce, Storm and all the other big data technologies out there, depending on the needs of the project,\" Bob Moore , CEO of RJ Metrics , a big analytics firm, says. \"Because this field changes rapidly, it is critical to have experience working with a given technology, to have mastered core engineering skills and to be able to learn quickly.\"\nSimilar to data scientists, data engineers need to be well-versed in data manipulation techniques. Data engineers who can build and maintain heaps of data are valuable to companies that use this data to gain a competitive edge.\n3. Ruby on Rails Developer | $147,000 | Silicon Beach, California\nImage: Flickr, Yuri Samoilov\nRuby on Rails developers in the SoCal area are getting the biggest bucks for programming in the nation. Aspiring Ruby on Rails professionals should check out Code School . As with any other technology language, practice is critical to becoming a master.\nSo what are you expected to know? Having a strong understanding of the basics, including Ruby language, is important to build upon a solid foundation.\nAccording to Joseph Biscan of Infinum, it’s a language that anyone can start learning. He offers some helpful resources in his blog, including Programming Ruby , a tutorial book on learning Ruby as well as Rails guides.\n4. Machine Learning Engineer | $131,000 | San Francisco, California\nMachine learning as it relates to artificial intelligence is an exciting field that focuses on developing complex programs that enable computers to teach themselves to grow. Ubiquitous examples of machine learning are Google’s web search, spam filters and self-driving cars.\n\"Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed,\" says Sebastian Thrun , professor of computer science and director of the artificial intelligence laboratory at Stanford University, according to Gigaom .\nTo master this specific skill set, again, it’s crucial to have a solid mastery of Python and R for statistical programming. Overall, machine learning is a crucial tool for manipulating big data in a useful, profitable way.\n5. Android Engineer | $131,000 | Mountain View, California\nAs mobile adoption is generally ubiquitous these days, with users spending an average of 2 hours and 42 minutes per day on mobile devices, it’s not a big surprise to see Android engineers make the top five most lucrative tech careers. (For good measure, iOS engineers were among the top 10.)\nThis is perfectly in line with our 2014 study, revealing that Android is outpacing iOS in terms of job demand, as Android-supported platforms have skyrocketed over the last couple years.\nTo get started mastering Android skills, it’s crucial to have a good understanding of Java as well as XML and OOP to render configurations and generate the UI.\nHave something to add to this story?

Her design credits include Rock Band, The Sims, Ultima Online, eBay, Family.com, Nytimes.com, Indiegogo.com, and numerous startups. In 2000, she published the book Community Building on the Web. She has a doctorate in behavioral neuroscience from the University of Washington and is an adjunct game design professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts.\nJohn Riccitiello, the CEO of Unity Technologies, is returning for the second year to our GamesBeat Summit. Riccitiello has been expanding Unity’s reach as a game engine that is democratizing game development by making it easier than ever to make games and publish them across platforms. And now he is adding services for game developers such as advertising and monetization. The former CEO of Electronic Arts is also reportedly raising money at a very healthy valuation. We’re looking forward to quizzing him on a variety of topics in a fireside chat.\nOwen Mahoney, the CEO of Nexon. Mahoney is a veteran of the GamesBeat stage, and he continues to make interesting strategic moves in gaming. Most recently, the company acquired DomiNations developer Big Huge Games, a Western studio founded by game pioneers Brian Reynolds and Tim Train. Mahoney has been signing up a lot of famous game developers, mostly by  pitching gaming as an art form . He spoke at last fall’s GamesBeat 2015 event, and we’re happy to have him back.\nJeri Ellsworth, the cofounder of augmented reality glasses maker  CastAR , will talk about augmented reality glasses based on the company’s new platform. CastAR glasses will be able to overlay animations and other imagery on top of the real world. It’s a creative product from an interesting hardware tinkerer. Ellsworth taught herself how to design chips and became known in 2004 for creating a Commodore 64 system on a chip with a joystick. She went on to become a hardware hacker and was part of a team of researchers at Valve, the maker of the Half-Life games and the new SteamVR virtual reality technology.\nMike Gallagher, the CEO of the  Entertainment Software Association . Gallagher is returning to speak as the chief lobbyist for the game industry. We caught him recently at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, where he aggressively defended and praised  the game industry for its fast growth and expansion to new platforms. Gallagher is the chief spokesman for an industry that has reached $99.3 billion in sales around the world, according to market researcher Newzoo.\nGallagher noted that just two decades ago, video games were a niche. Now games are an economic driver, he said, with $23.5 billion in the U.S. in 2015 sales across physical and digital segments. And they remain an innovative force in technology, too — just look at how games could be the killer app for virtual reality. The U.S. has 1,800 video game facilities (companies and offices), with more than 1,600 publishers and developers. And 406 universities have degrees or curricula in video games.\nPeter Phillips, the executive vice president and general manager of interactive and digital distribution for Disney’s Marvel Entertainment. He oversees Marvel’s New York digital media division, which creates and manages web, app, and social media experiences. He also runs the Los Angeles video games unit, which oversees the development of multiplatform games, and the L.A. digital film and video distribution group.\nBasically, he licenses game publishers and developers to make games based on Marvel properties, and that responsibility is a serious one. When he spoke at our event last year, he viewed the role as a “brand steward,” or being a caretaker who was very careful about what he allowed others to do with Marvel brands. We’re delighted to have him back for a fireside chat at a time just before the May 6 debut of Captain America: Civil War in theaters.\nRobbie Bach, the former chief Xbox officer. Microsoft lost $5-7 billion on the original Xbox, launched in 2001. And it made billions of dollars on the Xbox 360. Depending on the time frame in which you look at it, this was either an insane waste of money or the finest strategic decision that Microsoft ever made.  Robbie Bach had to make the call to do it or not. He was the chief Xbox officer from 2000 to 2010. After two console cycles, Bach decided to do work as a “civic engineer” to help fix both charities and governments. We look forward to a discussion of what Bach learned from his efforts and how they are relevant today to companies that are trying to establish new platforms. Bach recently wrote a memoir book, Xbox Revisited , about his time at Microsoft and his own efforts to fix our country’s civic problems.\nRami Ismail, the cofounder of Vlambeer. Ismail is one of the most  visible independent game developers  in the world. The cofounder of the Netherlands-based Vlambeer  is trying to use that fame to give back to the indie community and do good. The studio’s has a signature style, and fans have supported it all the way. Five years ago, Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman started the company. Their hits include Super Crate Box (2010), Serious Sam: The Random Encounter (2011), Gun Godz (2012), Ridiculous Fishing (2013), Luftrausers (2014), and Nuclear Throne (2014). Ismail has also been active supporting indies with the Indie Press Kit ,  DoDistribute , DoToolKit , and  GameDev world . Ismail is outspoken on social issues, and he has taken gamers to task for online harassment. And he remains a big advocate for the global gaming business.\nNoah Falstein, the chief game designer at Google. Falstein has had a long history of making video games. But at Google, which doesn’t make traditional video games, you would think that he doesn’t have much to do. But he does. Falstein noted in a panel that I moderated last year that  Google supports games across the whole spectrum, perhaps more so than any other company. Much of its focus is in getting the next billion people to play games on such platforms as Android devices and virtual reality.\nAt last year’s Game Developers Conference, Falstein talked about doing games using Google’s Project Tango, the augmented reality technology that can map the 3D space around you and, using a tablet screen or future augmented reality glasses, project an interactive experience into that space. You can conceivably play a 3D horror game inside your own house where you hide behind your own furniture to escape a monster. Falstein has also talked about creating games such as the massively multiplayer online mobile game, Ingress, which was recently spun out of Google as Niantic. Falstein has served in game design roles at the Inspiracy, Suddenly Social, NF Interactive, LucasArts, Dreamworks, and 3DO.\nNeil Young, the CEO of N3twork. Young and Bob Stevenson launched N3twork as a social network based on interests groups in 2013. It didn’t take off as expected, so they pivoted last fall into mobile gaming. That was an unusual move, but it showed how flexible Young was in adapting to the fast-changing market. And, if anything, gaming has been changing fast in the past few years. It won’t be an easy path as big companies are starting to dominate the top-grossing games in mobile. But Young has pulled off some interesting feats in the past. In 2008, he started Ngmoco with Stevenson at the dawn of the iPhone era. Japan’s DeNA, a mobile and social gaming company, acquired Ngmoco for $400 million in 2010. Before that, Young spent years working on triple-A games such as The Lord of the Rings, The Sims, and the experimental Majestic game at Electronic Arts. He built his first game when he was 14.\nSome of our topics include:\nPlatforms: Where to place your bets: VR, AR, and more\nThe opportunities in the $90 billion game industry have never been bigger.  Platforms such as smartphones, tablets, and mobile messaging services have created new ways to reach more gamers than ever before. But a single game company can’t do everything. As virtual reality and augmented reality arrive, resource allocation becomes a real challenge. Where should you place your bets? How do you reach the most people? How do you reach the most engaged consumers who are perfect for your games? Our session will help you sort that out.\nMonetization: Where mobile game monetization meets marketing and retention\nYou cannot monetize efficiently without first having an engaged audience. This discussion will host an open round table of mobile experts to dive into crafting the perfect balance between monetization, retention and marketing, creating a game funnel that generates revenue.\nDeals: Follow the money\nThe conventional wisdom says that it’s smarter to invest in the emerging markets of augmented reality and virtual reality than in mobile games. But FunPlus recently announced a $50 million fund to invest primarily in mobile games. The overall surge of investment dollars into private gaming companies has been followed by a slowdown in recent months. Will this snail’s pace continue, or will we see certain segments start the upward cycle again?\nAd fraud: How to deal with it\nThere’s a dirty secret in mobile gaming when it comes to acquiring users. You have to be able to detect fraud to be able to make sure that you’re really monetizing the way you think you are.\nIs the gaming world flat?\nWhat are the ingredients necessary to turn a region into a hub for great game development? That’s a good question, and it’s an economic gold mine for any region that figures it out since games have become a $90 billion industry, according to tech advisor Digi-Capital.\n \nInternational expansion\nEast is going West, and West is going East. How do companies expand out of their comfort zone and move into new markets where the users and the spenders are? What are the nuances for moving into these new markets?\nOur event advisory board includes:\nSinjin Bain, CEO of MaxPlay\nGordon Bellamy, visiting scholar at USC\nSeamus Blackley, Xbox cofounder and consultant\nMichael Chang, senior vice president of corporate development at NCSoft\nDaniel Cho, chairman at Innospark\n", "deleted" : false }

Small businesses often have to worry about different time zones, different languages, and even different customs and traditions.\nWhile there’s no catch-all, golden resource that can solve every problem a small internationally-minded business could have, there are some easy ways to keep your business up-to-date and in the overseas loop.\nHere, we'll help you through the basic steps of interacting with overseas clients, from translating pleasantries to tracking shipments to making sure you don't accidentally call them in the middle of the night.\n1. Basic Information\nBefore you even get started, it’s important to know the basic information about your client’s country. Usually the most thorough and reliable way to bone up is through the country’s official webpage. England , for example, has a good site with lots of information. Unfortunately, most of these sites are geared towards tourism and less so the time-pressed businessperson.\nWikipedia can actually be a great, quick and comprehensive alternative. Wikipedia pages exist for most major countries and include a helpful info bar on the right side of the page (usually just below the country’s flag). This information includes official languages, government make up, population estimates, GDP, currency, time zone, and calling code.\nAlso check out The World Factbook , maintained by the CIA. It includes \"information on the history, people, government, economy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 266 world entities,\" according to their website.\n2. Time Difference\nNo one likes getting a business call at 3 A.M., especially when you thought it was scheduled for 3 o’clock in the afternoon. Time zones and time differences can be difficult to remember on the fly, especially if you’re handling international clients from more than one country.\nTime Zone Converter is one way to keep all your zones and time differences in check. The site lets you convert any time from a huge range of possible countries and zones. Ever wanted to know what time it is in Moscow, Russia when it’s 11:25 A.M. in Dublin, Ireland? (The answer is 2:25 P.M.). You can also look up time differences on specific days, perfect for future meetings or conference calls that might overlap with tricky shifts in daylight savings. One catch: Zones are described by their central cities, so you’ll still be able to convert even if you don’t see your home town.\nWorld Time Zone is a more graphical display of time zones across the globe. You can either eyeball the map, based on Greenwich Mean Time, look up relative times in world capitals, sort according to continent, or simply type in the place you’re looking for. With an impressive, nearly exhaustive list of cities, if World Time Zone doesn’t have it, it probably doesn’t exist.\nLastly, if you're in a hurry, you can alway use Google. All you have to do is search \"time City, State, Country,\". For example, if you \"time Atlanta, GA\" Google tells you the time right now in Atlanta.\n3. Translation\nQuoi? Qué? Huh? No matter how you say it, it’s important to speak a little of your client’s home tongue. Fortunately, there are some simple ways to pick up some pleasantries without taking a night class.\nSome basic often-used options include Yahoo! Babel Fish , Bing’s Translator and Google Translate (complete with its own drag and drop buttons ). All three are easy to use, but a little slow when in the middle of a chat, and are best employed in emails. Word of caution: Though the language range is impressive, and usually spot on, sometimes idioms and complicated sentences can throw off the accuracy. For example, the phrase: “So great speaking with you again!” translated into French on Babel Fish reads “Parler tellement grand avec vous encore” (To still speak so large with you again!).\nGoogle also has some translation bots you can add into your Google Chat. By adding a series of coded bots as friends in Google Chat, you can send quick IMs to be translated. For example, en2fr@bot.talk.google.com will translate from English \"2\" French. This is helpful when you need a sentence quickly, or when you’re typing an IM.\n4. Chat Services\nPhoning long distance can rack up bills pretty quickly. Free chat services like Skype , Google Chat and Campfire are fast, effective, and accepted ways to speak with your clients. Skype is an instant messenger with a built-in web-video function. You can use it as either a phone, IM chat, or for face-to-face discussion online. After both parties set up an account, the whole process is free and relatively pain free. Also, some phone and portable devices have Skype enabled so you can take the chat service with you. Google Chat offers similar services to Skype, with expanded video and phone options being included.\nCampfire is a message-based business group chat and file-sharing service. Campfire has more customizable options than Skype or Google Chat but requires a monthly payment. It is also tailored for people within a business — meaning it might be the perfect option if you have an office overseas and don’t mind the monthly fee.\n5. Shipping\nNobody like shipping things, but it is a necessary evil. While you might have to slog through getting your package to the post, a couple sites can help you track how and when it gets to your clients. TrackThis , TrackthePack , and Packagetrackr are online services that let you track shipments by email, text message, Facebook or Twitter. All three sites track major US shipping carriers like FedEx, UPS and DHL Global Mail by looking up your tracking code. Packagetrackr promises all the same services as the other two but will auto-detect your tracking code when you email your shipping confirmation to its email address. And as an added bonus, TrackThisPack has an iPhone app .\n6. Cultural Faux-Pas\nWhen dealing with other cultures, it’s important to know what is in good taste and what is considered bad etiquette. For example, it’s best not to invite your Indian client to a steak house without first asking (cattle are sacred for Hindus) or to give your Russian client an even number of flowers as a thank you (even numbers are reserved for funerals). There are a variety of ways to find these customs and traditions on independent sites , About.com or Kwintessential ’s extremely helpful international etiquette guide . Often, the best way to gauge foreign customs is by politely asking about anything you’re unsure of.\nThese resources can help you connect with your international clients and improve the reach of your small business. While this post focused on web-only resources, there are many other resources out there and ways to connect. Please add your favorite resources, hidden gems and best tips in the comments below.\nFor more business coverage, follow Mashable Business on Twitter or become a fan on Facebook\n", "deleted" : false }

For those that think the proprietary world can easily follow suit, however, simply by giving away \"express\" versions of their software, or through developer programs, Optaros consultant Jeff Potts has some advice : \"Try again.\"\nJeff Potts\nIt's absolutely true that most open-source code gets used and not modified. Few bother to to view the source code.\nBut for a system integrator like Potts' employer, Optaros, code is critical. Potts is particularly well-suited to call this out, given that prior to Optaros he was a vice president at Hitachi Consulting where he did Documentum and other proprietary software deployments.\nWhile Potts, in his response to a Documentum developer post, lists several reasons that open source is superior to proprietary software for developers, it's ultimately source code availability that underlies them all :\nDevelopers working with closed source ECM vendors can't see the code. It's obvious, I know. For developers that work with open source it is extremely natural to use the CMS [Content Management System] source code when debugging or for reference. You don't even think about it-it's just there and you use it. Imagine the frustration of someone who works with closed source CMS who has to routinely decompile classes to figure out what's going on. That truly sucks. What good is a \"Developer Edition\" that doesn't come with source code?\nNot much. For system integrators, in particular, source code is essential. Proprietary vendors that treat their products like a \"black box\" that can only be accessed through a magical API are doing their partners, and hence themselves, a disservice.\nDisclosure: Optaros is an Alfresco partner, and also works with a range of open-source CMSes, including competitors to Alfresco.\n", "deleted" : false }

AnastasiaDate.com conducted a survey revealing one in four men won't get off the couch to find love. The majority of men ages 35 to 55 have dated online and, of those, 65% successfully met a special someone. One quarter of men in the study say they're too nervous to speak to a woman they find attractive, but they fare much differently approaching a person online rather than a face-to-face interaction. One in five men will date \"out of their league\" because of the wider opportunities online dating yields. Lawrence Cervantes, chief communications officer for AnastasiaDate.com, argues the shift from traditional dating to online doesn't rid romance of its established habits, it only improves them. \"It's far more convenient, takes emotional stress away from the process, and is more efficient,\" Cervantes says. \"It doesn't eliminate the traditional dating ritual, just gives it a shot of Vitamin B.\"\n", "deleted" : false }

Fully half of the responses I received included at least some usage of Basecamp or Backpack.\n37signals’ tools are very popular choices, but I also received several responses from startups that started out using Basecamp, but made the decision to switch to something else. I think that indicates that a lot of people are pretty familiar with Basecamp already, so in this list I’ll share three less-commonly used tools that different startups have chosen to use to collaborate, and the reasons why they use them:\nAdvertisement\nRedmine . Startup  Gloto uses Redmine. VP Technology Tony Jacobs says, “The basic requirement is to make sure that each product, customer project, and internal project is tracked separately. The wiki (despite being a fairly weak implementation) is good enough to hold the stuff we need to see, and it will track documents and files in addition to wiki-formatted input. The related bug tracker is essentially a wiki for each bug as well, allowing richer links. We added [G]it as [an] SCM tool (in addition to our subversion repository), and Redmine integrates with both nicely. The key things that we looked for during the review is that the tool is actively maintained, reasonably stable, supports easy backup/restore operations (MySQL (s orcl) dump is the preferred method) and is easy to use. Having the tool look good was important too, because we expose this interface to our customers on occasion, and we always want to present a good face.”\nProducteev . SubMate co-founder Jonathan Benoudiz says, “At SubMate, we love Producteev because it’s really easy to master and provides a seamless workflow integration with the “Email-to-task” and the instant messenger integration (we use Gtalk (s goog) a lot). We all have iPhones (s aapl) and it’s pretty cool to be able to check how everything is going on at the office with the iPhone app when on the go. Sometimes when I commute, I have 15 minutes to spare and just have to launch the app and identify a quick task that I can complete from my iPhone. We are a young startup that grew from two to five in two months. With Producteev, we can just add new team members and told them to browse completed tasks to be more familiar with how the product evolved.”\nScrumWorks . Unicast Director of Product Michael Tuminello says, “We use [ScrumWorks] with in-house and remote teams and have found it to be very effective. A web-based drag-and-drop UI lets individual team members take on daily tasks and track hours against them. On the product management/design side (where I am), a desktop client lets you enter, estimate and prioritize individual backlog items (work items). You can pull reports to see how the team is progressing against the project timeline, and it all ends up in a database. Our VP of engineering has been able to write custom code to pull the data and look at it in Excel (s msft) pivot tables for additional information outside the scope of ScrumWorks itself, like helping to determine the relative ROI of individual features.The Java client can be a bit kludgy, but overall it’s a very effective program, and Danube is very responsive to feedback.”\nAdvertisement\nPhoto by Flickr user Stephen Cummings , licensed under CC 2.0\nAdvertisement\nRelated GigaOM Pro content (sub. req.): Report: The Real-Time Enterprise\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

They are rumoured to be launching two Facebook apps (one for event registration and one for event recommendation) in the next week or so (who isn’t?). They are also developing a channel on Ustream.tv to cover local events. The company provides a great package of event management tools including online registration, email marketing (souped-up spam) and online event promotion.\nTheir online event promotion tools include a nifty service called Event Network Listing that can only be described as “AdSense for events.” The service lets event planners for a fee list an event on any site or blog in Eventbee’s growing partner network. The partner network consists of sites and blogs that have AdSense-like code embedded on their sites. This allows for highly targeted and controlled event promotion. You can see Eventbee’s network event listings in action on Rajesh Setty’s LifeBeyondCode .\nEventbee partners get paid in two ways. First, they get an initial listing fee for each new listing that they get to set in advance. Second, when event ticket purchases are initiated from their site they receive a commission. The commission amount is set in advance by the event planner. Eventbee keeps 29% of the total earnings partners make.\nEvent planners can create customizable event pages on Eventbee’s site just like you can with Eventbrite (see our Eventbrite TC20 page here ). Tickets sold from event pages start with fees as low as 1.45% of ticket price, plus a minimum fee of $0.25. RegOnline and Acteva also offer online event registration.\nEventbee’s glorified spam, I mean, email marketing service is tightly integrated with their online registration. You can create beautifully designed emails by importing HTML code or using their WYSIWYG editor. The service allows you to track bounced emails, opened emails and online registration URL click-throughs.\nThey currently have over 6,000 event managers. They are self-funded with CEO Bala Musrif claiming to be profitable since 2005 with no plans for raising money.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

As we noted at the time, the copyright claims seemed somewhat dubious, as one of the MLSs, Metropolitan Regional Information Systems, Inc. (MRIS), appeared to mostly be claiming copyright over factual information. There were a few other problems with the lawsuit as well. But, the real issue was that it seemed quite clear that the lawsuit had little to do with copyright at all, but was about real estate agents not liking the fact that NeighborCity had started rating real estate agents. AHRN claimed that it suddenly started getting complaints and threat letters (many of which were very similar) right after the National Association of Realtors' annual meeting in November 2011. There was also an email accidentally sent to AHRN's CEO, by one of the execs from an MLS that filed the lawsuit, which basically admitted they wanted to bring a \"world of hurt\" to the company. Of course, making the matter even more complex, is that the National Association of Realtors (NAR) got in trouble for antitrust violations a few years ago.\nGiven all that, it's not surprising to see that in AHRN's latest response to the original lawsuits, it's filed counterclaims arguing that the actions are antitrust violations . The fact that NAR offered to cover the legal expenses for the MLSs only makes the situation look worse for NAR -- and advances the suggestion that this is really about realtors being pissed off that someone is holding them accountable. NeighborCity highlights that soon after the original lawsuits were filed, NAR approved $161,667 in legal fees for these kinds of legal efforts, despite it not actually being a part of the lawsuit.\nDefendants’ coordinated: (a) cease and desist letters to AHRN, (b) refusals to deal letters to AHRN; (c) repudiation letters to AHRN, (3) sham lawsuits against AHRN and (d) agreement or offer to pay for or contribute to the costs of litigation against AHRN by MLSs and real estate brokers, was intended to and did have anti-competitive effects on AHRN in the market for real estate brokerage services. Anti-competitive effects include the elimination of price competition and price maintenance on brokerage services above market levels nationwide, impeding and blocking market entry by AHRN and other\nWe're quite used to seeing legacy players in an industry fight innovation and upstart competitors who change the nature of a market, but it's rare to see cases where it seems so incredibly blatant that they're doing this just because they don't like the service in question, rather than via any sort of legitimate copyright claim.\n", "deleted" : false }

It's Complicated", "date" : { "$date" : "2014-10-14T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "URL" : "http://mashable.com/2014/10/14/google-vs-amazon/", "content" : "Google's 'Rivalry' With Amazon? It's Complicated\n1.7k\nBy Seth Fiegerman\n2014-10-14 20:53:14 UTC\n\"Many people think our main competition is Bing or Yahoo,\" Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, said this week in Berlin. \"But, really, our biggest search competitor is Amazon.\"\nSchmidt likely intended to persuade a skeptical European audience that Google is not all powerful and faces more competition than some might assume. Even so, he offered the clearest comments yet on how Google views Amazon as a top competitor.\nSee also: Google Glass is Getting a Second Look from Businesses\n\"People don’t think of Amazon as search, but if you are looking for something to buy, you are more often than not looking for it on Amazon,\" Schmidt continued in his speech. \"They are obviously more focused on the commerce side of the equation, but, at their roots, they are answering users’ questions and searches, just as we are.\"\nOne day after Schmidt's remarks, Google announced a major expansion of its same-day shopping delivery service, as if to underscore just how seriously the company takes the threat of Amazon.\nAs two of the largest Internet technology companies, Google and Amazon have inevitably brushed up against each other over the years, but the overlap between them has arguably become more pronounced in recent months.\nAmazon followed Google's lead in selling smartphones and recently poached a creator of Google Glass to work on a mysterious project. The ecommerce giant raised eyebrows for acquiring Twitch , a game streaming service that Google was reportedly eyeing, in August. And Amazon recently started using its treasure trove of data to target ads on third-party websites, moving closer to Google's bread and butter.\nMeanwhile, Google has worked to make its search engine more shopping-friendly by adding product listings and consumer reviews . It has doubled down on same-day product shipments and even invested in drone deliveries , as Amazon has.\nAt the most fundamental level, both Amazon and Google want to be the top online destination for people searching for items to buy. They want to control as much of the experience around that search, by owning the devices shop with and in some cases controlling the fulfillment process. Online shopping has been Amazon's core focus from the start, but the company must invest in new areas to keep up with tech trends and ward off competitors. Google, on the other hand, has come to recognize shopping as a key user search activity and one that marketers are intensely focused on when placing ads.\n\"The competition for Google is not only for direct advertising dollars, but for people going directly to Amazon and bypassing Google’s search network,\" says Yory Wurmser, a media and marketing analyst with eMarketer, who notes that this is even more of an issue for Google in a mobile-first world. \"The head-to-head competition is growing.\"\nGoogle's investment in its same-day delivery service, with a commitment rumored to be as much as $500 million, is certainly its boldest bet yet on this front. \"Google Express and Google Shopping in general is Google aligning with retailers to fight against Amazon. It's a way for Google to be a service provider for retailers,\" Wurmser says. Perhaps the most obvious example of that was Google partnering with Barnes & Noble to deliver books.\nInside Google, Amazon is on the short list of tech competitors discussed by employees.\n\"People in Google were absolutely aware and talking about Amazon,\" says Mark Ebel, who worked on the business development team at Google last year after it acquired the previous company he worked at, Channel Intelligence, to improve the Google shopping experience and better compete with Amazon. The conversation, he says, \"was about what does the Google ecosystem look like in three- to five years and who are the major players.\"\nWhile the two companies are actively competing in certain areas, they also depend on each other to some extent.\nAmazon reportedly spends more than any other company on Google's U.S. search ads. Amazon also uses Google's Android operating system for some of its hardware, though it offers a separate app store.\n\"As a competitor they certainly keep us on our toes, but as a partner they advertise on Google for a variety of their products and we work collectively to grow the pie and build the industry as opposed to fight over smaller portions,\" said Jonathan Rosenberg, a former Google product manager, in one recent interview .\nJames McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research, compares the budding rivalry between Amazon and Google to the relationship that Google and Apple have: they compete against each other for smartphone and tablet market share, but many of the top apps on iOS are from Google and Google generates significant revenue through ads delivered on Apple products.\nMcQuivey believes that Google has the advantage in a fight against Amazon, simply based on it having a much broader reach globally and tremendous financial resources, but both companies have work to do.\n\"Google's approach gets it wider distribution faster, but it will take time and money to go deep,\" he says. \"Amazon is going deeper into physical lives, but it will take a tremendous amount of time and money to scale more broadly than that.\"\nHave something to add to this story?

These environments have unique needs that cannot be properly    addressed with traditional contact center WFM solutions. The new    generation of WFM offerings is using algorithms and functionality    tailored to address issues like deferred work and backlog, which are    characteristic of back-office activities.\nThese solutions also help to optimize front- and back-office activities    by taking advantage of downtime in contact centers. Enhanced flexibility    in scheduling, a hallmark of the new WFM solutions, increases employee    engagement and satisfaction and improves productivity for companies;    everyone wins - employees, enterprises and customers.\nDMG expects the number of seats in the WFM market to increase by 11% in    2016, 2017 and 2018, and by 12% in 2019 and 2020. It's possible that the    revenue in the WFM sector will grow more quickly than seats, as vendors    introduce and sell innovative capabilities like intraday management and    mobility to the market.\nThe greatest potential for revenue expansion comes from sales of    back-office and branch WFM solutions. If the vendors figure out how to    communicate the benefits of using WFM in these operating areas and can    open up these market opportunities, the growth rates will likely exceed    DMG's expectations.\nKey Topics Covered:\n", "deleted" : false }

This enables you to get an overview of what’s popular on the internet across different categories, all on a single page (which also means you’ll be scrolling down quite a bit).\nGranted, Newsified isn’t going to win freelance designer Luke Stevens any prizes for innovation, but it’s bound to be of interest to those who like to stay on top of what’s hot on the web, regardless of what category it falls under.

Don’t Bother Asking Google Or Bing\nDanny Sullivan on September 18, 2014 at 9:12 pm\nMore\nIt’s not often you have a vote that might create a new, independent nation. But that’s what’s happening today with Scotland. It’s such a big event that you’d think Google and Bing would be doing something special to provide election results. That’s not the case.\nBoth search engines have long done special presentations for U.S. elections  or even sporting events like the recent World Cup and Olympics. But the referendum on whether the country of Scotland would separate from the United Kingdom — its federation with England, Wales and Northern Ireland — isn’t getting any special attention.\nHere at Search Engine Land, we’ve been watching both search engines all day, as the vote has been underway. It seemed surprising that there was nothing unusual being presented, but we thought perhaps that’s because results weren’t in.\nNow the first results have come out, for the Clackmannanshire council area. More will be coming shortly, and it’s clear that neither search engine will be providing any special formats to show them directly.\nHere’s Google, for a search on scotland vote :\nAs you can see, it looks like any typical search results page, versus this type of presentation that happened for the 2012 US elections:\nA search for other topics such as “Scotland election,” “Scotland results” or just “Scotland” didn’t produce anything special, either. Nor did going to Google UK reveal anything unusual there, either.\nOver at Bing, this is what appears for Scotland vote :\nAlong the right-side of the screen, kudos to Bing for doing much better than Google in providing some special related information about the election generally. It shows general info from Wikipedia about the referendum, links to some of the related people for the election, plus tweets that are deemed relevant.\nBing has been providing predictions for the Scottish vote over the past few days. Today, this changed to a final prediction for the overall outcome, a 48.7% Yes vote versus 51.3% for No. But anything about the actual vote, as it’s coming in? Nothing, nor anything for some related searches.\nA check at Yahoo, Ask.com, Blekko, Yandex and Duck Duck Go also show nothing special happening at those search engines.\nThe lack of special attention is especially surprising because there’s clearly great interest in the vote. It’s the top trending item for Google Trends in the United States, fifth globally and “Scottish independence” is third-most in the UK:\nBy the way, if you are after those results, I’d suggest stopping off at the BBC, which has a dedicated Scottish vote page with them (one that isn’t being listed by Google or Bing yet. So does the Guardian .\nPostscript (Sept. 19, 5am ET): Now that all the election results are in, Bing has updated its prediction box to show the final count for the No vote (which won) as well as what it predicted:\nAbout The Author\nDanny Sullivan\nDanny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

Gonzalez built battery-powered units with ESP8266 and a button. When the button is hit, some code hits a web server.\n“Donald Trump’s silly picture resonates with people,” Lindahl said in an interview with TechCrunch. “I love coming to this hackathon and doing non-commercial things just for the fun of it because I want to help tell everyone that it’s important to be playful when you hack on things.”\nLindahl said he’s been to almost every Disrupt SF Hackathon. He previously worked for Blekko, a search engine recently acquired by IBM’s Watson. Lidahl and Gonzalez worked with David Skrenta, Bryce DesBrisay and Rich Skrenta on the hack.\nThe team joked that they decided to create a game using a button because when you’re dealing with drunk people, you don’t want to show them all how to download an app and play a new game. But even your drunkest friend can probably hit a button.\n“Given the state of the Republican party, that’s about the best you can do — drink heavily,” Lindahl said.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

According to Gasgoo's analysis, the total sales volume of global EVs in 2015 has risen 72.8% year-on-year. Closer to home, the EV sales in China has reached 207,382 units, beating the US to rank first world-wide. The rapidly rising popularity has propelled growth in the global lithium battery industry in multiples. Even conservative estimates have the global market for lithium batteries hitting US$100 billion in the coming decade.\nChina, with the combination of technology and production ability, is in a unique position of leading the world EV production and market. Analysts predict that by year 2020, even 100 1GWh battery factories would probably not fulfill the large needs of China's EV market alone, creating tremendous room for growth.\nNot surprisingly, capital markets are eagerly eyeing the electric vehicle market in China. The explosive growth in 2015 has attracted intensive investment from listed companies. Reporters based in China are investigating leads about a few local lithium battery manufacturers engaged in substantial business activity. According to informed sources, two major global investment banks have contacted the leading EV cell provider Boston Power early this year pitching for the listing business, and have proposed an initial valuation in the range of US$8-13 billion. Other financial institutions are also following the situation closely with clear hopes to benefit before its IPO. With a valuation this large, a few skeptical investors regard the valuation as too high. However, as one expert puts it, the core value can be found in their technology edge, production capability and clientele. Following this logic, Boston Power is backed by its two research centers at Boston, Massachusetts US and Beijing, China and customer wins for over 30 types of EV models from likes of Dongfeng, Geely (Xindayang), Nanjing Golden Dragon, etc; coupled with its three production bases in Jiangsu, Taiwan and Lanzhou, China.\nAt the beginning of 2016, a government work report has clearly stated \"the construction of more battery-charging facilities for new energy vehicles\". In a similar vein, China's State Council has also proposed \"assigning top priority to revolutionary battery technology as one of the five measures to support the new energy vehicle industry\". If said were true, Boston Power's timing could not be better.\nReporters tried to contact Mr. Alex Pan, President of Boston Power, but did not receive any replies regarding to the IPO. However, a relevant source confirmed that Boston Power has set up an internal IPO team to manage the listing process; also, besides the US, Hong Kong is also one of the bourses being evaluated by the company.\nMar 16, 2016 12:13 HKT/SGT\nTopic: Press release summary\n", "deleted" : false }

(Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)\nA\nSINGAPORE: Scaling a business can be tricky: Too fast and a startup could stumble when entering new markets, too slow and it could mean death for the company.\n“The reality is that 80 per cent of the success of a business, I would argue, has nothing to do with the entrepreneur themselves, it has to do with the lay of the land,” said Mr Greg Mittman, Vice-President of internet startup MyRepublic.\nHis advice for startups looking to scale their business is to be sensitive to market timing. \n“Is there a seam in the market that is opening up? Is there an opportunity that is created because you’re in Asia Pacific? Because you’re in Singapore? Because you’re in a specific market? Is there something going on from a regulatory perspective? Or is there a demographic shift? You want to be very sensitive to identifying opportunities that you can then exploit,” he said.\nTHE PEOPLE FACTOR\n“The team is the most important thing in any startup,” said Mr Chua Kee Lock, Group President and Chief Executive Officer of Vertex Holdings, which focuses on venture capital investment opportunities in the information technology and healthcare markets.\nHaving the right team will enable the startup to execute its plan properly, he added.\nMr Mittman agreed: “You need to be able to be a big sucking machine where you bring in people that are as passionate and as driven and that have a complementary skillset to you, whether they come in as co-founders or cornerstone employees that are themselves incented to be successful in the business.”\nFACILITATING THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS\nWhile startups often begin with one to three founders, Mr Mark Strecker, a startup veteran and CEO of Amobee, a global marketing technology company, said that to scale the company, founders have got to start to push decision-making responsibilities down to other people in the company.\n“You can’t be the person who is taking the decision the whole time, so you need to build a team around you who can do the jobs better than you can,” he explained.\nAfter that, processes should be put in place within the company so the company can start operating by itself and the business can scale up, Mr Strecker said.\nFind out how eight startups are trying to take their businesses to the next level as they compete for up to S$500,000 in seed money on Start-UP Season 3, every Monday at 8.30pm SG/HK on Channel NewsAsia.\nCatch up on Start-UP episodes on their website . \n- CNA/ek\n", "deleted" : false }

On-demand music services have the same music (more or less) because the same copyright holders decide which songs to put on subscription services, and they typically put certain songs on all of them, or none.\nSoundCloud comes from the other direction. Originally envisioned as a method for music industry people to share tracks with each other (the lack of a good method for which they called \" one of the web's broken things ,\" the service has accumulated an astounding catalog of music, some of it (including rare, live, remixed , and DJ-ed) available nowhere else.\nFollowing a recent cash infusion of $60 million, SoundCloud recently launched a new, more elaborate player interface . That's the same amount of money Beats Music had when it spun off from Beats Audio , and with which it secured licensing to include music from all of the major labels, which means SoundCloud now has enough money to license everything that's on Beats Music, Rdio, Rhapsody, Sony Music Unlimited, Spotify, Xbox Music, and the rest.\nAdvertisement\nWhat would happen if SoundCloud manages to secure major and indie label music to play alongside the long-tail and rarer stuff for which it has become so well known, as SoundCloud is reportedly trying to do ? Someone has tried something like that before, and it didn't end well.\nNot many people probably remember Qtrax, but I do, because I got caught up in its weird non-launch six years ago. The idea with Qtrax (as it would be with a SoundCloud, sort of) was to present not only the 20 million or so officially released tracks, but also all the \"gray area\" music found on file sharing networks and the like — live versions, remixes, unreleased takes, rehearsal tapes, and whatever else. Qtrax told me they planned to remunerate the appropriate copyright holders for that stuff, even if it were never actually released.\nSponsored\nSoundCloud's plan is different, because it already has the right to distribute a massive amount of rare or unique audio tracks not available on the other services. In the parlance of our times, here are \"5 reasons\" a subscription version SoundCloud could be pretty nice for music fans and copyright holders:\nMonster Catalog\nMost crucially, SoundCloud would be able to serve up all the music on the other services, right alongside all of the weird, rare, stuff that has found a home on SoundCloud. The same playlist or streaming radio station could include the latest chart-topper followed by the latest weird remix of that same song, as just one example of the sort of thing SoundCloud would be able to do that the others currently cannot.\nEngaged Fans\nAdvertisement\nIf you've ever listened to music on SoundCloud, you know how great the commenting feature is. Unlike the other services, SoundCloud lets you comment at specific points in the song. When other people play that song, they see the comments as they're hearing the same part of that song. People really like it (especially commenting on dubstep drops ). It would be nice to be able to listen to more music in that way.\nAPI\nRdio and Spotify have APIs with which developers can make their own apps. So does SoundCloud, and hundreds of apps already use it. Many of those apps are for recording music — the idea is that people can create music in those apps, and then upload it directly to SoundCloud, the way popular video editing software lets you upload it directly to YouTube.\nSoundCloud as a consumer-facing music service would encourage a proliferation of SoundCloud listening apps. So now, you'd have the same API handling lots of musicians' uploads, as well as listeners' streaming and downloads. Which brings us to…\nMonetizing Independent Music\nRecording artists would be able to insert their music into SoundCloud right alongside all the major label music, from within the apps many of them are already using to record. Depending on how much people listen to the more fringe stuff on SoundCloud more of the overall pool of subscription money would (easily) arguably go to independent musicians and producers than it does on the other services.\nThen again, bands like The Strokes, Nine Inch Nails, Beyonce, and many more have already put their music on SoundCloud directly. So really, something like this could affect the fundamental structure of the music industry. SoundCloud's approach of expanding the catalog past the traditional labels and online distributors could extend to the other services — possibly even through SoundCloud's own API.\nEDM Rising\nElectronica producers, DJs, and musicians have already made SoundCloud the most important destination for their music because it lets them throw their latest mixes up on the web and into apps in seconds and have it distributed instantly to all their followers. This behavior is perfectly suited to the creators of and fans of the fastest-rising genre of music .\nEvolver.fm observes, tracks and analyzes the music apps scene, with the belief that it's crucial to how humans experience music, and how that experience is evolving.\n", "deleted" : false }

The company’s existing investors, TimeWarner, RRE Ventures and Union Square Ventures, also participated in this round. The company had previously raised $6 million in November 2010.\nThe NYC-based company, which launched way back in 2008, has gone through many iterations since then. It now focuses on allowing users to share their activities, like watching a TV show, reading a book, seeing a movie and more, and then comment, reply or vote on comments from others who are doing the same thing.\nThe service is available online (desktop and mobile) as well as on mobile apps for iOS and Android. Over 30 major media companies now use GetGlue (via its API) to integrate the network’s user activity into their own websites and apps. These include Fox, NBC, Showtime, HBO and DirectTV, which offers a “first screen” experience that allows you to check-in to the program you’re viewing using your remote control.\nIn addition, over 75 major television networks work with GetGlue to reward fans of their 680 popular shows with stickers and discounts. The group, which includes major networks like ABC, CW, FOX, NBC, A&E, ABC Family, AMC, BRAVO, CNN, Discovery, Food Network, FX, HBO, MTV, Showtime, TNT, and USA, also uses GetGlue’s backend monitoring and analytics offerings to track engagement levels among their shows’ fans.\nOver the past year, GetGlue has seen incredible growth. At the beginning of the year, the network had 750,000 users. It now has 2 million. Check-ins grew 1000% over 2011 and crossed the 100 million mark by year-end. And GetGlue’s database of check-ins, ratings and comments has over 350 million entries.\nSome of GetGlue’s most recent efforts have been behind the scenes. For example, in September, the company introduced a curation feature that uses homegrown NLP (natural language processing) algorithms to automatically filter and hide comments on TV shows to reduce the “noise.” This includes automatically hiding profane speech and other short-form comments. After implementing the change, GetGlue saw engagement levels climb by 50%. Now, every three or four comments will include a vote or reply.\nAlthough GetGlue offers you the ability to check in to a number of activities – and that’s not going away anytime soon – the main focus is on the social TV experience, an increasingly hot focus these days. Says CEO Alex Iskold, TV is clearly the biggest area of interest for the service’s users, followed by sports, movies and then all the rest.\nThe additional funding will be used mainly for product development, says Iskold, as the plan is to keep the company’s 40-person team as small as possible.\nThe company is also planning to launch updated apps, for iPad, Android tablets and possibly the Kindle Fire in the new year.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Bill2Phone! »\nMichael Cerda, Jangl CEO - Interview\nOPW INTERVIEW -- Aug 31, 2007 -- Jangl has the best and most successful telephony integration on a dating site I've yet to see. It's live on Match.com . The service has been industry tested, is making money and is also live on AdultFriendFinder, Facebook and Tagged. Here's my interview with Mike Cerda. - Mark Brooks\nWhat does Jangl do?\nJangl connects your phone and your online life, safely and privately. That’s it in a nutshell. Jangl bridges someone’s phone with their online presence. And, by online presence, we mean an online dating or social networking profile, a classifieds ad, an auction, a blog, or any other place where there is an online communication happening. The phone wasn’t part of that before Jangl. But by bridging the phone and the web, Jangl is making phone numbers behave and respond to consumers in the same way an email address does – with privacy, control and management features, and ultimately convenience.\nWhat is Jangl’s founding story?\nWe set out, back in 2005, to build a lifestyle communications company that delivers services without all of the friction of headsets, downloads, and plugging into various pieces of hardware. We also wanted to offer services that consumers can use when they meet people in various ways online – not just another VoIP service based on cheaper long distance.\nThus, our focus on bridging phones with consumers’ online lives. Privacy was the first problem that we needed to solve and that’s what we focused on as a company: you can’t bridge the phone and the web without offering consumers privacy and control. Right after our initial $2 million round with Storm Ventures and Labrador Ventures in 2005, we began working with Match.com to power its MatchTalk service. Of course, that required us to scale very quickly. Six months later, we raised an additional $7 million. Storm Ventures, Labrador Ventures and Cardinal Venture Capital are the three investors in Jangl today.\nUltimately, as steep as that ramp was, it was good for us, because today Jangl is the only company of its type that can power a large-scale deployment like that. Social networks are growing so incredibly quickly, they have to partner with companies that can keep up. In part, that’s why Jangl today connects 20 million online profiles with phones – because we’re a consumer-oriented service with an enterprise-grade network.\nWho are your top 5 partners?\nOur top 5 partners are Match.com, Various (which has the FriendFinder properties), Tagged.com, Justin.tv and Facebook, with an application called Phonebook. Another one very interesting to me is Revision3 which, among other things, is producing Diggnation, a terrific show with Digg co-founder Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht, and The GigaOM Show with blogger Om Malik and Joyce Kim. It plays into our social media efforts.\nOur service is obvious with regard to online dating and social networking because it lets people who are trying to meet each other talk on the phone without exchanging numbers. But, our service isn’t so obvious with social media. Social media is all about producing content and bringing an audience to that content and having everyone engaged in a continuous feedback loop. Jangl brings phones into that loop.\nDo people really get anonymous calling yet?\nI think they get it when it’s presented in the proper context. I don’t think people sit around and say, “Oh, I wish I had some anonymous calling capability.” People get to emailing and flirting with others online and want to take it to the next level, but aren’t sure if the other person really is who they say they are. They want to be able to control who calls them and when and that’s where we come in. You also have to understand that connecting the phone and the web is a brand new concept. When you describe to people what that means for them, the need for anonymity and privacy and control become much more apparent.\nWhere is the money?\nFor Jangl, the money is in licensing, consumer subscriptions and transactions and, soon, advertising. So, for example, take licensing. In online personals, money changes hands between the consumer and the property. When we provide the ability to talk on any phone, from anywhere, with anyone you meet online, we receive a cut of this premium feature.\nIn social networking, though, money is not changing hands between the consumer and the property. It’s changing hands between Google AdWords and the properties. In social networking, we’re trying to own and monetize the dial tone in those social networks, much the same way the social networks monetize the traffic.\nThe numbers are staggering when you consider that Jangl is de-siloing two huge markets: the phone and the web. In the U.S. alone, there are more than 200 million online profiles, and 225 million cell phones; worldwide, it’s 500 million profiles and over a billion mobile phones. The global advertising spend in social networking is about $1.4 billion right now, and is expected to double by 20101. Total mobile ad spending is at $1.4 billion, but expected to grow to over $14 billion by 20112. So the numbers are there no matter how you look at it. We’re bridging two huge markets that, for as much as they’ve exploded already, really still have the majority of their growth in front of them.\nWhat are your goals for Jangl through the end of 2008?\nIt’s all about our service, partnerships, and advertising. Obviously, we’ll continue adding functionality to Jangl itself -- moving beyond talking and texting, and moving into content sharing, more precise control over when and how people can be reached, functionality based around groups of people. We plan to drive more activities through this utility we’re offering. You’ll see us do things in places like Facebook, where we build adjacent applications to promote usage of Jangl Phonebook. You’ll see us do things like this inside Tagged, as well, where we build a service along the lines of phone tag. We’ve got strategies around user-generated content, phone numbers, mobility, and new and interesting partnerships evolving in the classifieds and auction space. We’re doing a lot of plug-ins for other IM clients, for the various mail services that are out there.\nIn terms of partnerships, vertically, we’d like to get the majority of the top 10 online dating sites using our service, and we’re about to announce another win there. We are in a few of the big eight social networks and want to make our service available to the other social networks as they deploy APIs and so forth.\nAlso in 2008, we'll be launching our advertising play, talking with buyers and planners, with customers, with different parties associated with the advertising food chain. Again, we're mindful of doing it right – but already having multiple revenue streams lets us take enough time to ensure it is.\nWe see the rest of 2007 as a real estate land grab because we would much rather be in every profile as part of users’ communication flow rather than being a widget directory. If you can have residency in each of these profiles, half your battle is won. Jangl’s doing smart deals that get us there and that’s what we’re focused on for the rest of this year.\nAug 31, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

Which isn’t to say he hasn’t seen a few hard knocks. All good founders do. In 1999 Kim founded “Dialpad Communications”:http://www.linksv.com/companySummary.aspx?co_idURL=1464, as a spinoff of South Korea’s Serome Technology. An early Internet phone service provider, Dialpad sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001, only to be “acquired by Yahoo! in 2005”:http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1828833,00.asp. In 2004 Kim founded *Opinity, Inc* an online reputation management startup, which “also struggled”:http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199900172.\nNow Kim is trying again. Earlier this year he cofounded a Digg-competitor called “Spotplex”:http://www.spotplex.com/, which aggregates and ranks blog and news media content, but without tagging or voting. Instead, Spotplex ranks the stuff people are reading most, a bit more impartially; that is, based on generic impressions.\nSo *what keeps this repeat founder going?* Read on and you’ll see, Kim is all business, all the time — but don’t think this means he has no fun. Poker is on the list, and Kim dreams of retiring to a Mediterranean island one day! (Don’t we all?)\n*1) Where are you from and what year were you born?*\nAdvertisement\nSeoul, South Korea in 1969\nAdvertisement\n*2) What is the first thing you do when you get up in the morning–even before breakfast?*\nAdvertisement\nTurn on my PC and log on to www.spotplex.com to determine if the site is working properly.\nAdvertisement\n*3) What is your academic background? How does it relate to your business training?*\nAdvertisement\nI received my M.B.A. from the University of Michigan and B.A. of Political Science from Yonsei University in South Korea. Much of the training I had in school has little in common with what I do now in technology, but overall I can say it helped me establish a unique framework through which to view the business and market.\nAdvertisement\n*4) Other than managing staff or fundraising, what do you spend most of your time doing as a founder?*\nAdvertisement\nEven though the term “founder” appears on business cards, it does not function like a regular job title. There is no industry standard job description or generally accepted role for a founder within an organization. And there shouldn’t be, in my opinion. In a start-up, a founder just has to do whatever is necessary at the time, which can change hourly from accounting to marketing to PR to customer support to business development and back again.\nAdvertisement\n*5) What is the least “founder-like” thing you do on a daily basis?*\nAdvertisement\nI think all things that in some way contribute to the success of the business are “founder-like things.” Regardless of how small the task, a founder is usually the first person to volunteer to do it and the last person to delegate it. To answer the question, perhaps it’s responding directly to customer support emails, which I do daily.\nAdvertisement\n*6) What is your most precious possession?*\nAdvertisement\nMy family: my wife and two kids\nAdvertisement\n*7) We get a lot of questions from readers about how to find a co-founder. What was it about your co-founder that told you he was the right person to found your company with you?*\nAdvertisement\nYou just have to find the right person who has complementary strengths in terms of business function. Spotplex’s Co-Founder also serves our CTO, so he leads the site’s development and engineering, while my strengths lie in sales, marketing and operations. A good co-founder should also have strong opinions and know when to not back down in order to balance key decision making.\nAdvertisement\n*8) Short of grabbing the so-called Brass Ring (an IPO or selling Spotplex), where do you find day to day fulfilliment in running your business?*\nAdvertisement\nProduct or site releases are usually done in the middle of the night. What I feel in the car driving on my way home in the early morning hours after major release is something very difficult to describe in words. It’s a tremendous feeling of pride or an overwhelming sense of achievement. At any rate, it’s very fulfilling experience for me. Maybe that’s why I do what I do.\nAdvertisement\n*9) What is your favorite non-business source for inspiration? Perhaps a book or film?*\nAdvertisement\nMy favorite film is “Mediterraneo,” an Italian movie that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1991. The film is set during World War II and follows a group of Italian soldiers who become stranded on a Greek island and are left there after the war ends. They each find their own niche on the island and decide that being stranded is not necessarily a bad thing. That’s how I am going to live once I retire!\nAdvertisement\n*10) How do you bond with your Spotplex staff outside the office?*\nAdvertisement\nI consider them as my family too. In a way, I spend more time with them than with my real family anyway. I’m trying to spend more time with them out of office doing family *BBQ* or *playing poker,* but sometimes we are simply too busy for those.\nAdvertisement\nRead more Q&A with Doyon “here”:http://www.folksonomy.org/2007/07/interview_with_spotplex/.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5725fba2cbaf4c0001a6e940" }, "companyIDs" : [ "zintin", "moximity" ], "title" : "The State of Location-Based Social Networking On The iPhone", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-09-28T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "URL" : "http://techcrunch.com/2008/09/28/the-state-of-location-based-social-networking-on-the-iphone/", "content" : "The State of Location-Based Social Networking On The iPhone\nPosted\nRealScoop Tells You When Politicians And Celebrities Are Lying\nWe’ve been bullish about location-based social networks for quite awhile now, especially since Apple announced that it would open up the iPhone to developers. And with two significant developments in this space just this week (more on that below), we thought it would be a good time to take a step back and look at the options currently available through the Apple App Store.\nWhat makes a “location-based” social network different than a normal one? At least as things stand today, location-based social networks run primarily on smartphones that have the ability to determine a user’s current location, usually by leveraging GPS or cellular tower triangulation. The social network then uses your location to reveal nearby friends and places of interest. See our Location Technologies Primer for additional information.\nCurrently there are six major location-based social networks available for the iPhone (click on the comparison chart to the right). All of them tell you how far away other members are from you, with most focused on helping you find your friends but some designed primarily for discovering strangers. A few of them chart the location of your friends’ on an interactive map (something I actually think all of them should do). They provide a wide range of privacy settings, but all will stop reporting your location when you simply close the application (Apple has yet to release its push notification system that will let these apps constantly report your location in the background). They also vary widely in how precisely they identify the locations of other members, although all but one of them work anywhere in the United States.\nAfter testing this entire batch, I’ve come to the conclusion that none of them is quite ready to achieve mainstream usage. I believe most, if not all, of the following things must happen before location-based social networking becomes the new “killer app”:\nThey need powerful notification systems that actively inform you when someone of interest is nearby. Such a system could be set up manually by individually indicating which friends are “of interest”. But it would be even better for the system to learn from your interactions (messages, pokes, wall posts, etc) and affiliations (profile information, common friends, groups) and automatically identify certain people you’d like to meet up with.\nThese applications absolutely need to update your location while the phone is sitting in your pocket. Right now it demands too much from users to open the application whenever they want to inform friends where they are. Serendipitous encounters would be far more common with a fully foolproof and automated location-updating system.\nWhen inviting friends to a service, you need the ability to determine which of your friends actually have a supported phone. Otherwise you’re just spamming a large number of people who matter to you and with very little yield.\nThese apps need to get more stable; they crash way too much.\nWe need more hooks into web applications so we can share our location and location-based activities not only with other mobile users but with the web at large.\nThose apps that let you see and meet strangers nearby need to highlight both friends of friends and those who share common interests and affiliations.\nThese are weaknesses shared by all of the current iPhone location-based social networking apps, each of which we cover briefly below.\nThe Veteran – Loopt\nPerhaps the most well-known of these companies, Loopt has been working for years to get its technology on a variety of phones (the iPhone being just the latest and most functional of them). It is also perhaps the most developed of the batch, and the most generic. Use it primarily to see on a map where your friends are located nearby. Restaurant and other local reviews are secondary, having been brought into the app through a partnership with Yelp . Get directions to other users, view their latest status updates (which are often accommodated with photos taken on-location), and ping them when they haven’t updated their location for awhile.\nThe Mountain View-based company has ventured into the matchmaking business this week by adding a new feature called “Mix” that shows you, for the first time on Loopt, strangers in your vicinity. You can see all of the people nearby who have turned on the Mix feature, and you can filter by types (age, gender, tags, dating status, community) as well. This is Loopt’s attempt to help people hook up at bars (an idea that gets thrown around by many entrepreneurs and has always puzzled me). But if it takes off, it may have even greater sociological effects than Loopt’s core friend-finding capabilities.\nThe New Kid On The Block – Moximity\nLaunching into private beta just this week, Moximity is a new location-based social network out of Austin, Texas that wants to help you find both your friends and local establishments. Taking Paul Bragiel’s marketing advice , Moximity is rolling out one geographical region at a time, starting with Austin itself. Everything is local – the restaurant listings, the users, and even the advertisements (yes, this is the only one of these networks actually monetizing on the iPhone right now).\nOne major quality that sets Moximity apart is the way it handles user accounts. When you join and start configuring, you don’t make “Moximity friends”. Rather, the service pulls in your contacts from Facebook (and later, other sites as well) and lets you track those of your existing friends who also use Moximity. When you post a status message, it also gets pushed out to your Facebook and Twitter accounts.\nMoximity would benefit from an interactive map that uses pins to show where your friends are located. However, unlike Loopt, which gives you the precise street address of your friends, Moximity always matches you with particular places (restaurants, stores, etc) so individual pins for users might not be appropriate. Co-founder Bryan Jones says some breed of mapping functionality will be included in the next release.\nIf you live in Austin, you can get into the service immediately by emailing your name and zip code here .\nThe Bezos, T-Mobile and iFund-Backed Contender – Whrrl\nThe best-funded of the bunch is a Seattle startup named Pelago with an app called Whrrl that centers around identifying and reviewing nearby establishments of all types. Locating friends takes a bit of a back seat to the idea that you should share Yelp-like reviews with the people you know.\nThe information about places is comprehensive. You can find cuisine types, prices, hours, phone numbers, websites, street addresses, ratings and reviews. While you can view the (5-star) ratings and reviews from every member, you’re encouraged to focus on those of your friends. When you view a friend’s profile, for example, their reviews are displayed prominently. That said, you can “fan” strangers if you like their tastes (although apparently only through Whrrl’s thoroughly developed web app ).\nWhrrl also identifies events that are going on in your area. The combination of event and place information is great but I get the feeling that this app will have to depart a bit from its “reviews” roots to become a widely embraced service. More generic social features (such as walls and notifications) are needed to get me to use Whrll when not looking to share or gather opinions.\nPelago has raised its funds from the iFund , Jeff Bezos, and T-Mobile (among others).\nThe Schmorgesborg – uLocate’s “Where”\nWhere is an iPhone app developed by a Boston-based startup called uLocate that has received a considerable amount of funding (at least $15.5 million ) over the last several years. It has everything but the kitchen sink. Along the bottom of the app is a dock-like menu that shows a variety of sub-applications, each meant to help you find something in your area:\nBuddy Beacon: find nearby friends\nGasBuddy: find nearby gas stations with low prices\nStarbucks: find nearby Starbucks franchises\nQuibblo: see location-based poll results in your area\nHeyWhatsThat: identify mountain peaks in your vicinity\nThe Skymap: learn about the stars and constellations in the sky above you\nZipcar: find pickup points for Zipcar rentals\nYelp: find nearby places listed and reviewed on Yelp\nEventful: learn about nearby events and their venues\nThe UI needs a bit of work (too many popups) but regardless, this app is handy for quickly finding the nearest of some particular thing on an interactive map (coffee, friendship, wheels, etc).\nThe Categorizer – Limbo\nLimbo is provided by a company that seems to have undergone quite a few transformations over the years. We reviewed the company in May 2006 when it was a bizarre auction service based on text messaging. Back then it was located at 41414.com and you can still see that ancestry in the current logo (just look at the reflection).\nThe app is, at its heart, more focused on locating strangers and learning about what they’re doing than any of the aforementioned apps. All users are categorized by four types: Members, Contacts, Friends, and Faves. You can opt to share your location with each or all of them, with “Members” being everyone you don’t know, “Contacts” being people pulled in from your phone’s address book, “Friends” being people more important to you, and “Faves” being the most important people to you.\nUsers are further categorized based on their current “activity” (or status). They are either socializing, eating, playing, chilling, working, feeling, or enjoying a bit of “me time”. You can view users by their particular categories on a “What” page that displays the categories in a grid.\nLimbo neither shows you your friends’ locations on a map nor gives you their exact locations (just their general regions, e.g. San Francisco). Both would make this app a lot more useful.\nThe Wall – Zintin\nZintin has gone even further in the direction of helping you communicate with strangers nearby, rather than helping you find your preexisting friends. Users in the vicinity are displayed in all-inclusive list along with their current status messages. When you select a particular user’s name, it takes you to their Wall, where short notes, photos, and scribbles can be posted by any user.\nThe Wall is the central, and pretty much only important, feature provided by Zintin (so-called “bulletin boards” are also provided but they’re essentially Walls for particular regions). If you find someone with particularly cool stuff on their Wall, you can request to exchange your contact information and meet them. But most people will just use the app to see what kind of juvenile stuff others around them have decided to share. If you’ve turned on the “allow mature content” setting, then that content is primarily explicit material, so be warned.\nZintin, which has been in development by a few Stanford CS grad students since late 2007, is mostly a curiosity at this point. However, the scribble feature, with which you can make quick doodles and post them for others, should make its way into other apps.\nThe Elephants In The Room – Facebook and MySpace\nNeither of the big American social networks have added location-aware services yet, but they’re coming . Expect them to eclipse several if not all of these services after learning from them.\n", "deleted" : false }

Apex grew 40.7 percent year-over-year, and 17.4 percent on a pro forma    basis. Excluding the revenue contribution of $74.6 million from Creative    Circle, the Apex Segment grew 16.5 percent year-over-year.\nOur Oxford Segment accounted for 25.0 percent of total revenues. Oxford    grew 8.4 percent year-over-year (10.8 percent on constant currency    basis). Excluding the revenue contribution of $2.8 million from an    acquired business, the Oxford Segment grew 6.3 percent (8.5 percent on a    constant currency basis).\nGross profit was $192.9 million, up $50.4 million or 35.4 percent    year-over-year. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.4 percent.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $138.8    million (24.0 percent of revenues), up from $101.2 million (22.9 percent    of revenues) in the fourth quarter of 2014. SG&A expenses for the    quarter included $15.6 million from Creative Circle and the acquired    Life Sciences business in Europe, and acquisition, integration and    strategic planning expenses of $5.0 million.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $11.3 million, compared with $5.5    million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in amortization is    mainly related to the acquisition of Creative Circle.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $9.1 million compared with $3.2    million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Interest expense for the quarter    was comprised of (i) interest on the credit facility of $7.5 million,    (ii) amortization of deferred loan costs of $0.9 million, and (iii)    accretion of discount of $0.7 million on the contingent consideration    liability related to the Acquisitions.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure as    calculated in an accompanying table) was $40.6 million ($0.76 per    diluted share). Net income on a GAAP basis was $19.3 million ($0.36 per    diluted share).\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure defined below) was $70.7 million, or    12.2 percent of revenues. The Adjusted EBITDA contribution from Creative    Circle was $16.8 million.\nDuring the quarter, we repaid $30.0 million of long-term debt and at    December 31, 2015, our leverage ratio (total indebtedness to trailing 12    months Adjusted EBITDA) was 3.02 to 1, down from 3.21 to 1 at September    30, 2015.\nFinancial Estimates for Q1 2016\nOn Assignment is providing financial estimates for the first quarter of    2016. These estimates do not include acquisition, integration, or    strategic planning expenses and assume no deterioration in the staffing    markets that On Assignment serves. These estimates also assume no    deterioration in foreign exchange rates.\nRevenues of $550.0 million to $555.0 million\nGross margin of 32.5 percent to 32.9 percent\nSG&A expense (excludes amortization of intangible assets) of $134.8 to     $135.8 million (includes $5.1 million in depreciation and $7.2 million     in equity-based compensation expense)\nAmortization of intangible assets of $10.1 million\nAdjusted EBITDA of $56.5 million to $59.0 million\nEffective tax rate of 39.5 percent\nAdjusted income from continuing operations of $31.6 million to $33.1     million\nAdjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.58     to $0.61\nIncome from continuing operations of $15.3 million to $16.8 million\nIncome from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.28 to $0.31\nDiluted shares outstanding of 54.1 million\nThe above estimates assume billable days of 62.8 for the quarter. The    above estimates also include the effects of the payroll tax reset, which    occurs at the beginning of each year. The reset results in an estimated    sequential increase in payroll taxes of approximately $8.5 million (or    1.5 percent of revenues) of which approximately $5.0 million relates to    cost of services and the remainder to SG&A expenses.\nConference Call\nOn Assignment will hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. EST to    review its fourth quarter financial results.

Such information is    provided as additional information, not as an alternative to our    consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally    Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), and is    intended to enhance an overall understanding of our current financial    performance. The Supplemental Financial Information sets forth financial    measures reviewed by our management to evaluate our operating    performance. Such measures also are used to determine a portion of the    compensation for some of our executives and employees. We believe the    non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management,    investors and prospective investors by excluding certain charges and    other amounts that we believe are not indicative of our core operating    results. These non-GAAP measures are included to provide management, our    investors and prospective investors with an alternative method for    assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the    performance of our ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent    basis for comparison between quarters. One of the non-GAAP financial    measures presented is EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,    depreciation, and amortization of intangible assets), other terms    include Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus equity-based compensation expense,    impairment charges, write-off of loan costs, and acquisition,    integration and strategic planning expenses) and Non-GAAP income from    continuing operations (Income from continuing operations, plus write-off    of loan costs, and acquisition, integration and strategic planning    expenses, net of tax) and Adjusted income from continuing operations and    related per share amounts. These terms might not be calculated in the    same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled    measures reported by other companies. The financial statement tables    that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of each    non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP    financial measure.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements made in this news release are “forward-looking    statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange    Act of 1934, as amended, and involve a high degree of risk and    uncertainty.

It’s one more example that shows virtual worlds aren’t as hot as they used to be and there are plenty of winners and losers in this market. In the past year, virtual worlds such as Metaplace , Vivaty , Lively by Google, There.com and others have shut down. Gaia Online and Linden Lab have laid off staffers.\nThe kids market became particularly heated in 2007 after Disney bought Club Penguin for more than $350 million (with full earnout, the price would have been $700 million, but the site didn’t hit its targets). By January, 2009, more than 200 kids virtual worlds had been started. The most successful virtual worlds that targeted kids were Poptropica, WebKinz, Runescape, Club Penguin and Moshi Monsters.\nSan Mateo, Calif.-based SecretBuilders is also one of the survivors. Started in 2007, the company has more than 1 million unique monthly players and it has nearly 2 million registered users, said Umair Khan, chief executive. The user base is now growing by about 500,000 per quarter, even though the company doesn’t spend money on advertising. Part of the success is that SecretBuilders has repositioned itself, focusing more on kids casual games and less on building out a full virtual world. SecretBuilders has 12 sections where kids can learn about art and literature as they play dozens of mini games. Khan says the goal is to be “engaging and enriching.” The educational part has enabled SecretBuilders to be used in more than 1,500 schools.\nBut Khan said his company wants to expand to new platforms. For instance, SecretBuilders is available on the Android-based Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet computer now. And it will become available on other platforms such as Facebook in the coming months. With the addition of Dizzywood, SecretBuilders will have more kindred users.\n“In the future, we want to be on all the platforms that people consider to be electronic babysitting devices,” said Khan, noting that parents often give kids their phones to distract them.\nKhan said the company’s metrics are looking good. The maximum number of concurrent users — or those playing at the same time — is now three times what it was just four months ago and the number of people logging in daily is double what it used to be.\nDizzywood was started in 2008 by Scott Arpajian and it raised $1 million from Charles River Ventures and Shelby Bonnie. Although the virtual world craze isn’t as huge as it used to be, Khan is encouraged that more kids are going online at an earlier age. On Facebook, there are also a lot of young kids who play games with their parents. And the number of kids using mobile phones is starting to grow. That means that casual games aimed at kids will be a growing market, Khan said.\nKhan is targeting kids with some proven features such as dress-up and personalization, home decoration, socialization, adventures and quests, and fun games. The company has 24 employees. Secret Builders has raised $4 million to date from The Entrepreneurs’ Fund, Launch Capital, Scott Hassan (co-founder eGroups, founding team member of Google), Michael Tanne (former CEO of Adforce), David Jeske (former Director of Applications, Google), Sheila Marcelo (CEO of Care.com), John Welch (CEO of MakingFun), Sohaib Abbasi (CEO of Informatica),  and Ken Morse (co-founder of 3COM).\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

Under the name Hamlet Au, he has reported from inside Linden Lab ‘s virtual world of Second Life for three years and he still maintains a blog about it. But now he is moving on to the greener pastures of the latest cool virtual world, Blue Mars.\nJournalists are fickle. But Au’s shift from Second Life to Blue Mars — a terraformed virtual planet where he will write an in-world blog dubbed Blue World Notes — is like an epitaph for an era and the beginning of a new one.\nThere is a business opportunity here, as one generation of technology gives way to another. World of Warcraft, a six-year-old fantasy role-playing virtual world, has more than 11 million users and generates more than a billion dollars a year in revenue for publisher Blizzard Entertainment, a division of Activision Blizzard. By contrast, virtual worlds such as Tabula Rasa and All Points Bulletin never caught on, resulting in losses of tens of millions of dollars. If opinion makers such as Au say that one world is cool and another one obsolete, other users may take notice.\nSecond Life itself was built mostly on its perception of coolness. Founded in 2003 by Philip Rosedale, Linden Lab’s Second Life became a virtual world in which Residents, as users of the online world were called, could create anything they wanted. Second Life’s growth really took off as it stopped charging subscription fees and users began engaging in commerce, selling the virtual goods they created. (Au is pictured left with his Second Life avatar).\nSecond Life went into its own hype cycle a few years ago, landing on the cover of Time magazine in 2006 . One company, Digital Pastry, which makes women’s shoes for Second Life, has generated more than $1 million in revenues from the sale of 200,000 pairs of virtual shoes since early 2007, for example. But as corporations such as IBM and Dell moved to cash in, users got tired of the fad. They moved on instead to the simpler graphics and to Facebook.\nVivaty, Metaplace and There.com shut down their virtual worlds. Second Life has held its own, generating lots of e-commerce and some user growth ; but it also succumbed in some ways as its parent firm lost its chief executive and laid off 30 percent of its staff ; its efforts to become a productivity tool for real-world enterprises has stalled. Watching these developments, Au, who is the author of The Making of Second Life , wonders if Second Life has lost its mojo .\n“I’m convinced that Blue Mars is the cutting edge,” said Au, in an interview. “It’s been thrilling and frustrating to see Second Life’s trajectory. It could take them a long time to fix their problems. ”\nAu said he believes that if any virtual world has a chance of unseating social networks, then it will be something that looks like Blue Mars. Blue Mars’ graphics are based on the visually arresting 3D engine from Crytek that powered games such as Crysis, but its activities are aimed at casual game players, such as those who enjoy parlor games on web sites or social games on Facebook. Au thinks that somebody will pick up the mantle of building a community around user-generated content. That passion is why the Honolulu-based maker of Blue Mars, Avatar Reality, chose Au for the job. As he was with Linden Lab from 2003 to 2006, Au will be a paid contractor for Avatar Reality, though Au says he will remain objective when reporting.\nIt will be very tough for any virtual world to reach the kind of mass market that Facebook has secured. One problem is that 3D worlds have often required hefty computers and big downloads. Second Life’s flaw is that it takes a couple of hours to learn how to navigate through it, whereas other virtual activities are instantly fun. Avatar Reality is hoping to achieve an instantly playable yet gorgeous 3D graphics world through cloud computing . Once Blue Mars launches that capability (which would resemble technologies being fielded by OnLive, Otoy and Gaikai), users will be able to participate in the high-end 3D world even if they don’t have sophisticated computers. That may happen in the next couple of quarters.\nAu isn’t alone in defecting to Blue Mars. John Zdanowski, former chief financial officer of Linden Lab, is now Avatar Reality’s CFO. Au will be joined in Blue Mars by virtual style and fashion columnist Janine “Iris Ophelia” Hawkins (pictured in avatar form, right). Au paid heed earlier this year when a group of die-hard Second Life “steampunk” artists set up shop in Blue Mars as if they were colonists. Au thinks that Blue Mars will be more attractive to the broader third-party development community because it embraces the kind of graphics tools that animators already use.\nBlue Mars launched its open beta in October, 2009, and began selling virtual land to third-party developers in January. The company was founded in 2006 by Henk Rogers, who introduced Tetris to the world, and Kazuyuki Hashimoto, former chief technology officer of Squaresoft and former vice president at Electronic Arts.\nAu says he will continue his older Second Life blog, New World Notes, on a part-time basis.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

(PGMI) has acquired the Penthouse brand, and all licensed assets from FriendFinder Network (FFN), an Internet-based social network, best known for its hook-up, dating and adult sites such as AdultFriendFinder.com.\nWhile Playboy has become more demure in its approach to being more in line with today’s culture and sensibilities, especially with millennials, PGMI, led by Kelly Holland (also known as Toni English), a veteran pornographic film director, is obviously defiant in its position and offered a mildly veiled shot across the bow.\n“While we plan to rollout a completely redesigned and reimagined global digital platform, we remain deeply committed to the 50+-year legacy of our print magazine,\" said Holland. \"Penthouse will continue to offer print readers the perfect mix of luxury lifestyle, cutting edge journalism and the hottest women in the world — nude — because, as we all know, nudity is not and will never be passé.”\nThis closes a chapter in the up and down, mostly down, history of the merger (Penthouse Media Group purchased FFN parent, Various, Inc. for $500m in 2007), with FFN filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2013, after being delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange for failing to trade for more than $1. The company went public in 2011, yet only raised less than $50m which the CEO attributed to investors being “prudish.”\nThe company also endured a data hack of Adult Friend Finder in 2015, where the email addresses, usernames, dates of birth, postal codes, sexual orientation, gender, race and computer IP address of close 4m was put online via the Tor network.

Aurora secured the land earlier this year. To date, the company has raised $72 million. Investors in the latest round include Oak Investment Partners and a new, but unnamed, strategic partner.\nThe infusion of new funds comes amid renewed interest among investors for industrial biology. In the past year, Amyris, Solazyme, Gevo and Codexis -- which make biofuels and biochemicals -- have all held IPOs. Yes, biofuel subsidies are currently under scrutiny in Washington, but federal policy still calls for increasing biofuel production over the next two decades. More importantly, the continued high prices of oil are prompting multinational manufacturers to look at renewable and recycled versions of nylon and other industrial chemicals. In all likelihood, that unnamed strategic partner will become a customer.\nAurora started out as a biofuel company, but last year shifted to grow algae for the food market. Omega-3 oils from algae and protein powders can be inserted into human and pet food. The company still hopes to make fuel someday, but like Solazyme and other algae companies, revenue in the near term will come from other markets.\nThe influx of investment is arguably also evidence that Aurora has recovered from its tailspin of last year. In 2009, Aurora's then-CEO Robert Walsh talked about having a 2,000-acre pond and producing fuel for $2 a gallon by 2012 . (Was Michele Bachmann on the board?)\nBut in February 2010, Aurora swapped CEOs . A few months later, it began to transition from being a fuel producer to a company that produces food additives that also happens to have a fuel division . The $2 fuel and a 2,000-acre pond do not, of course, exist at the moment. Still, money in the bank and a nutraceutical farm in Australia are signs of upward activity. And investors are showing more interest in food and agriculture.\nAurora's strategy has a few interesting twists. It grows algae in open ponds through photosynthesis, a process that is cheaper than bioreactors and fermentation kettles. It doesn't rely on genetically modified algae but rather on selectively bred algae -- again, this approach is cheaper than other options. But how you do keep invasive species out of the ponds? CEO Greg Bafalis told us earlier this year that Australia's climate will be a big help.\n\"Northwest Australia gets two months of rain a year and then it's all blue skies and sunshine,\" he said.\nThe company has also developed pesticides that kill other species but doesn't harm theirs. Mechanical systems also keep out invaders.\nTo remove the algae from the water -- one of the more costly challenges in algae -- Aurora uses technology similar to the components used in wastewater treatment facilities. It also employs centrifuges. How much de-watering costs and how well it works will be one of the primary factors in determining if Aurora sinks or swims.\n", "deleted" : false }

Fleenor / TNS\nFrom left: T.J. Miller, Zach Woods, Kumail Nanjiani, Martin Starr and Thomas Middleditch star in \"Silicon Valley.\" \nFrom left: T.J. Miller, Zach Woods, Kumail Nanjiani, Martin Starr and Thomas Middleditch star in \"Silicon Valley.\" \n(John P. Fleenor / TNS)\nTess TownsendInc. Magazine\nMartin Starr and Zach Woods play members of fictional startup Pied Piper on HBO's \"Silicon Valley,\" but you won't find the two taking photos of their meals for Instagram, posting videos on Snapchat or tweeting much about the show. \nWoods isn't on any social media, and while Starr has Twitter and Instagram accounts, he uses them sparingly.\nTheir online chastity sets the two apart from some of their co-stars, such as the prolific tweeters T.J. Miller (who plays Ehrlich) and Kumail Nanjiani (who plays Dinesh). Building a following on social media, especially on Twitter, is for many actors essential when it comes to building a career and reputation. Avoiding online back-and-forth may seem counterintuitive for a duo featured in a show centered on the tech industry that boasts former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo as a consultant.\nBut Starr, who plays Pied Piper's sardonic programmer Gilfoyle, says during an interview that he's had some bad experiences on Twitter that have caused him to take a step back from the platform. Woods, who plays the company's painfully awkward CFO Jared with exquisite precision, fears trolling and believes he might act compulsively on social media. He says he doesn't have any accounts.\nWoods also puts strict limits on his phone usage. (He says he'd like to see a startup come up with something that helps him to use his phone even less.) The actor often deliberately leaves his cell phone behind when heading out, he adds \"because, if I have it, I'll use it as like a comfort object. It's like an adult teddy bear.\"\nThe pair sat down with Inc. on the eve of the show's season premiere last Sunday to share their thoughts on why social media isn't always the ideal way for someone in the public eye to grow a following. Here's an excerpt:\nInc.: Do you guys get trolled online? On Twitter?\nZW: I'm not online for that very reason, and it's to stay troll-free. Maybe somebody will start sending me snail-mail troll remarks, like I'll just get like an old letter that has hostile stuff on it. But so far, no. I'm not on Twitter or Instagram or anything, partly because I can be a little compulsive about my phone and that would just be another thing to suck me into it, and also because I'm scared of the faceless horde of internet remarkers. I'm sure they would be able to point out numerous things, numerous Valley criticisms that, who knows if I could endure. So, better to shut yourself up in a Luddite bubble.\nInc.: Is that something that is just a general practice, or does it have anything to do with being on \"Silicon Valley?\"\nZW: No, it's just general. When I spend a lot of time online it makes me feel lonely. Even when I used to have Facebook, it would make me lonelier even though it's a social networking thing. I was like, \"I should get rid of this stuff, because if the whole purpose of it for me is to be connecting and it actually makes me feel more isolated, it's probably not good to use it.\" So I don't.\nMS: But I created a fake account for him, so every once in awhile, I read all of the comments, like, \"God, he's tall.\" \"What happened to him?\"\nZW: He'll read me those things. And then I'll just go sort of wander into the ocean.\nInc.: This is going to be a dumb question, probably, but did you actually create a fake Twitter for him?\nMS: No. I was totally joking. But that would be incredible.\nInc.: But you're pretty active on Twitter.\nMS: Oh, no. ... I tweet about things that I have upcoming, like live shows or things like that. I tend to use it for attendance purposes. I read a lot of the Twitter comments. Or I try to. But I feel like I had a couple weird interactions with fans via Twitter, and then I just kind of decided that it was a little bit too invasive. It gave people too close a connection. I was made a little uncomfortable by some things that happened on Twitter.\nZW: And it seems like the same interaction, you could have in person, and it would be totally nice. If it happened online it could feel (threatening) because you can't look in the person's eyes.\nMS: Often things happen or are said on Twitter that leave me feeling uncomfortable. Like there's a lacking of any humanity in this interaction. I'm left with the huge question, \"Why?\" Why does Twitter really exist if this is how people use it? Because no one would say that in person. Or if they did, they would probably find themselves in a lot of physical altercations. Maybe that is how they live their lives, but I don't wanna be around people like that in my real life, nor do I wanna be around people like that in a digital world. Maybe I'm leaving out the good. I'm sure there is a lot to be gained from that as a social interactive platform.\nZW: I don't want to sound like I'm condemning social media for other people. I think there's lots of good stuff that comes from it.\nInc.: Well, I mean, you guy are celebrities, so it is a little bit different, obviously.\nZW: That's a very liberal definition of celebrity.\nMS: Because we're liberals.\nInc.: Was it just people trying to have too much of a conversation for you, Martin?\nMS: It was really weird. It was a person who I had met in person, which I wasn't aware of at the time. I kind of responded to everybody when I first got on Twitter. I thought this was a good forum to be able to interact with people who connected with the things that I've been a part of.\nZW: Martin is, like, the sweetest man. He is so kind to people who extend themselves.\nMS: I'd respond to everybody, with whatever I felt in that moment, whether it was \"thank you\" or sometimes it was longer. But I wanted it to just be conversational and natural and honest, and, at some point someone said something. I said \"thank you\" about something, and they were like, \"that's it?\"\nAnd it became this back and forth of them feeling like they deserved more from me than I gave them in that moment. I was just like, \"OK, these aren't the interactions that I ever want to have.\" And it slowed me down.\nBut there are times I go onto Twitter and I'll respond to everything I see. \nCan you describe to me why this all took over? It's like we went from not having phones at all, and being able to find purpose in each human moment that we had on this planet, to having this thing that initially was a beeper. We knew when we were cool and popular because someone beeped us to get ahold of us.\nZW: I think basically what we're saying is, let's bring back the era of beepers.\n", "deleted" : false }

HwangHow do you run a new economy company with a falling stockprice?\nby Scott Thurm and Suein L. Hwang\nHow do you run a new economy company with a falling stock price?\nUntil now, that's been largely an academic question. Internet companies of all stripes have used buoyant stock -- and the prospect of even bigger payoffs -- to recruit employees, make acquisitions, even pay lawyers, landlords and electricians.\nNow, wildly gyrating share prices are putting this business model to the test. As the prospect of a stock market in free fall becomes all too real, Internet darlings are finding they have to pay employees more, treat them better, grovel for support services and, most of all, lay out a convincing path toward profitability.\nIn short: Falling stock prices change everything for the industry that was supposed to change everything. Now, says Jon Holman, who runs an executive-search firm in San Francisco, \"the dotcom companies will have to start doing all of the things other companies on the planet do.\"\nFor starters, that means attracting and keeping talent with lures other than surefire stock-option gains -- a task made particularly hard for Web retailers by the recent fall from grace. To snare Chief Executive Frank Newman, for example, San Francisco online pharmacy More.com Inc. offered a $500,000 salary, a guaranteed bonus of $250,000, a $500,000 relocation package, as well as a $1 million signing bonus in restricted stock and stock options valued at 5 percent of the company.\nBusiness-to-business Internet companies, until recently considered hot properties, are fighting recruiting wars as well. Lu Cordova, chief executive of Acteva Inc. , a San Francisco-based Internet \"marketplace\" for event organizers, says a recent candidate for chief financial officer demanded a $350,000 salary, plus \"huge\" stock options. Cordova demurred.\n \nPlunging stock values are making it harder for Internet companies to retain employees too. Silicon Valley workers often monitor the company stock price obsessively and are quick to flee when share prices stagnate or fall.\n\"People are very focused on the upside of the stock, on quick wins,\" says Janice Roberts, senior vice president of 3Com Corp., a maker of computer-networking equipment that struggled to recruit and retain employees after its stock lost half its value early last year.\nAt Nextcard Inc., a San Francisco issuer of credit cards over the Internet, officials have turned weekly Friday lunches into morale-boosting sessions. Nextcard shares, which hit a high of $44 last June, were at $14.375 in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday. \"We're saying, 'Hey, this is an absolutely exciting time for us as a business, and we need to separate the market's gyrations from the great success we're having every quarter,'\" explains Dan Springer, the company's chief marketing officer.\nSome companies may consider reissuing stock options at a lower price. The strategy can help keep employees, but it also can hurt earnings and anger investors. \"It's not fun and not easy to reset your option strike price,\" says Marc Bruneau, president of the consulting firm Renaissance Strategy Worldwide Inc., in Boston.\nGood for venture capitalists\nFalling stock prices are also making it nearly impossible for prospective Web retailers to obtain start-up money. When they do cut deals, start-ups will find themselves calling far fewer shots than has been typical in recent years.\nThis is a welcome change for venture capitalists such as Tom Dyal, a partner at Redpoint Ventures, Menlo Park. Calif. After the most recent market sell-off, Dyal said: \"As long as this debacle doesn't continue, it's probably the best outcome for the [venture capital] business.\"\nIn other sectors, late-stage financing deals and initial public offerings will be delayed, scaled down or canceled. \"People who need to do financing in a short time period will find themselves in a real tough squeeze,\" says Nextcard's Springer.\nCompanies also could find it harder to grow by acquisition as their stock becomes a less-compelling currency for purchases. New-economy paragons such as Healtheon and fiber-optic component maker JDS Uniphase Corp. have been aggressive acquirers, courting companies, as they do employees, with the prospect of rising share prices.\nStill, JDS CEO Kevin Kalkhoven says stock swings won't deter acquisitions, since, prices for targets are likely to rise and fall in tandem with JDS's own shares. \"We did deals when our stock price was half of today's, and we'll do deals when our stock price is twice what it is today,\" says Kalkhoven, who announced a US$750 million acquisition on Tuesday.\nInternet companies will find support services harder to come by. Melody Haller, president of the Antenna Group Inc., a San Francisco public-relations firm, stopped taking on new Internet-retailing clients six months ago. \"The game is done there,\" she says, arguing that some prospective clients have less of a business plan than a \"delusion\" of success.\nEven when support is available, it's likely to be more expensive. Lawyers, ad agencies, PR firms and headhunters have accepted -- in some cases demanded -- stock as payment for their services in recent years. Holman, the recruiter, says he will still take stock in start-ups but will demand more shares -- or more cash.\nAn Internet shakeout will affect these supporting industries as well. Internet companies spent $3 billion on advertising last year, to uncertain effect, and many companies are now cutting back. In particular, newcomers formed to take advantage of the Internet boom may suffer.\nAnn Grimes, Wall Street Journal, contributed to this article.\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

But back to the startups: What are the trends this year?\nIt’s safe to say the “quality” of the startups is somewhat higher this year. This is not to play down last year’s vintage – however, it’s clear that many of the teams have come to the event much more fully rounded as companies and products. The last couple of years of Seedcamp has tended towards cloud-based companies which are trying to shoot for the moon. The next Twitter. The next Skype. The next Google. That sort of thing. And in the first year they were mostly companies from London. Now, they are literally from all over the EMEA region.\nAlso, this year, the phrase “revenue” was uttered to a high degree during the pitches, and many of the businesses are aimed at solving users’ or company time, money or both – in other words this is your Recession-Era Seedcamp Week. I counted at least two Travel startups. Mobile startups were thin on the ground, but they were about saving time or money. “It’s all websites not widgets” said one mentor I spoke to, in a side-swipe at Web 2.0 boom-era startups. That pleased him. Another wanted to see more that “changed the world”. You can’t please everyone.\nSeedcamp Week 2009 Day 1 Highlights from Seedcamp on Vimeo .\nIt’s worth pointing out also that the slight ambiguity of past Seedcamp years has now gone. Seedcamp T&Cs now state that a startup cannot go into the programme unless they will take the investment offered. To remind you, that’s 5-10% equity (stakes are flexible) for a 50,000 Euro investment. That’s totally fine. They’ve assembled an awesome network of mentors. It would be a huge waste of everyone’s time if a startup got all that great advice and then effectively threw it back in the faces of the organisers and didn’t take the investment. However, that does leave the way open for an event or a programme or something to create a competition where there isn’t the obligation of investment, but a different kind of business model in Europe. But for now Seedcamp has the run of the place, and their networked model is paying dividends. [Update: After some feedback from some VCs I think there’s another point to be made here: Seedcamp sees lots of quality businesses as they guarantee funding. Another network like it would only be able to compete if it could replicate similar investor or CEO access. That could be tough]\nAnyway, without further ado here’s our rundown on the companies (we’ll be adding logos shortly).\nAdvertag – London, UK.\nThe pitch: The problem is that classifieds advertising doesn’t work [Ed – says who?). Craigslist is very good as is Oodle, AdTrader etc. But most classifieds have the same categorisation. This allows users to submit any advert-style listing a la Craigslist to a semantic database that produced a tag cloud based on the content. Advertag extracts data and creates tag cloud based on the advert. These emerge from the system as people add things into the database. The field changes as you click.\nBoxed Ice – Bromsgrove, UK\nThe Pitch: Existing server monitoring products such as Hyperic, Nagios and Cacti are often difficult to install and time consuming to set up. Internal monitoring of servers tends to require dedicated hardware. But Server Densitiy is software which does the same thing. It takes a data snapshot of processors every 60 seconds. The model will be a 30 day trial for free with a paid serice of £10 per server per month. They started in February and launched a full service in June this year. Started billing customer in July. CEO David Mytton, is a second time entrepreneur – his first startup was when he was 17 and he was the lead developer of WeLoveLocal.com.\nBrainient – Bucharest, Romania\nThis is a video tech startup which aims to help video publishers make more money with their video content via affiliate marketing. Publishers attach affiliate links to objects in their videos and the result integrates with video ad networks like DoubleClick, Brightroll, GoogleAdsense. Brainient automatically selects the most profitable ad for the publisher and takes a cut of the transaction’s value (10% – 15%). They are add in-video Polls, Chapters, RSS, etc. The team of 6 competes in interactivity with the likes of Quick.tv, Coull and Veeple, though they focus more on affiliate marketing.\nCodility – Warsaw, Poland.\nThe Pitch: This is is a platform which assesses the programming skills of developers in a few minutes. Not unlike Trollim you create a test which coders have to pass. Developers can complete a test and even run test compilations. The recruiters get a full report on how the dev did. Effectively this automates recruitment and then saves you money.\nComufy – London, UK\nComufy says it “believes that the user should decide how, when and by whom they are contacted”. To be honest their general pitch is incredibly estoteric. However, it made sense when they demo’d an application where you basically drag an drop your contacts into various fields which dictate how they contact you. Intelligent Flatplan is a company they have installed their software which lets editors automatically inform clients when the flatplan on a magazine changes. Another example would be on a dating platform where a user determines whether to block or prioritse IMs/tweets/email from someone they like or dislike. I can see this being used by businesses though it feels like a clunky consumer proposition.\nErply – Estonia.\nThese guys are very into building customised ERP/CRM systems and have done a lot, but now they are trying to build all their knowledge into one platform. ERPLY is a software service that is aimed at CRM, accounting, billing and inventory management for SMEs and though in beta stage they have 200 companies using it. Their pitch wasn’t the sexiest but it sounded interesting that they had a real-time dashboard and a touch-screen Point of Sale interface with a built-in webshop and e-commerce solution. Competitors would be Xero, NetSuite, and old DOS and Windows programmes and Microsoft Excel. They won Mini Seedcamp in Warsaw.\nJoobili – Budapest, Hungary\nBudapest based Joobili allows events and festivals organisers to input events. Then when you want inspiration for a holiday you work out what is on when. E.g. the Easter Markets in Prague, Snowbombing in Austria, Semana Santa in Spain, or even the International Fantasy Film Festival in Belgium. There’s also a social element to it, in that you could see which of your friends were going to an event. The business model would include paid-for enhanced listings, affiiate sales etc. The famed Esther Dyson is a Seed investor and Mentor apparently. Since the public beta launched a month ago they have 1,000 European events in the database and a few partnerships signed. Competitors would be TripAdvisor, IgoUgo, VirtualTourist, TripWolf, etc, however since Joobili is focused on the inspiration stage of travel they could in theory include these “competitors” as affiliate partners. Competitor event sites like Eventful, Zvents and Happenr are focus more on local nightlife – although who knows what their moves might be next.\nKukunu – London, UK\nYes, it’s another travel startup at Seedcamp, but this one is a Kukunu is a web-app that says it will “be your own travel agent”. You plan holidays and then share via socnets. That data is then fed into their recommendation engine to help you build a trip. It works off commissions. Competitors might be Tripit, Goplanet, Tripwolf, Dopplr and Travelmuse. This was possibly the thinnest pitch of the day.\nLoc8 Solutions – Edinburgh, UK.\nTheir desire is to make mobile apps as easy to build as WordPress apps. Their theory is that 90% if mobile apps are based on the same “Ten Blocks” of functionality. They provide an interface design tool that enables rapid development of these. Titanium, PhoneGap, Rhombile target developers with substantial experience, but Loc8 aims to be much easier. The idea is also that they would provide the paid service to allow a mobile app to sync with their service.\nPatients Know Best – Cambridge, UK\nThere are more specialists than ever before. The NHS and other healthcare systems requires patients to collate all their specialists themselves. Meanwhile the NHS must reduce spending in 2011 and every healthcare system out there is going through this pain. Patients Know Best says it is the first company to integrate into the NHS Connecting for Health network. Though online consultations you reduce consultations by 25%. Less face to face time means reduced cost esp for routine stuff. They want to launch in the US. Jusdging by the founders this is probably one of the most experienced teams at this event.\nPetsicon – Berlin, Germany.\nPetsicon is a “pet disease diagnosis system”. It helps pet owners check and inform themselves about possible diseases and provides detailed information and instructions for non-veterinarians. It further helps pet owners to get in touch with each other, gives helpful advice for pet care and lets its users access a variety of other pet related services. The basic service is free for the users, the company will make money with online advertisements and special premium services which are available to the users for a small fee. They are already in German and English market and plan a Japanese launch.\nPlug in SEO – London, UK.\nSearch engine optimisation is a morass of poor quality tools and consultants. Small businesses get lost in this. With pluginseo you add JavaScript tracking to your website, enter some keywords and your competitors. It then continually generates recommendations (based on Google and Bing guidelines) and quantifies the success of SEO efforts. The model is 3-tier freemium product with revenue mainly from premium users, obviously. They have 500 Beta customers so far.\nShoutEm – Zagreb, Croatia.\nThis is a sort of Ning for microblogging. Anyone can start a co-branded microbloging social networking service on this platform. It’s a way for small and niche communities to start their own private, cobranded Microblogs and Mobile Social Networks. They make money by selling their technology, premium services and custom solutions to big customers. Useful for niche communities looking for simple social networking, not something big and loaded with features. They are working on Android, iPhone, Windows mobile apps to become a full White Label mobile social networking service. So far they’ve have raised 300 000 Euros soft loan from Croatian VC fund and were a Seedcamp finalist in Slovenia.\nPearl Systems ) – Bristol, UK.\nPearl manages web based Accounting, CRM and Business Software for SMEs. Yes folks, it’s another accounting bundle for SMEs. As a SaaS product, the billing is monthly, based on the Freemium model, up to £45 per seat per month. They are targeting users of Sage, Outlook, Magento ecommerce, ACT! etc.\nTalasim.com – Amman, Jordan.\nBilled as the Onion of the middle east. The founder says it’s “Comedy as a serious means for getting thoughts and ideas out.” This is serious stuff in the Middle East. It began as a blog 4 years ago but is now in in UGC video etc. UGC pictures are syndicated to the media. Live in 6 countries in the ME they also produce the biggest Jordanian videos on YouTube. It has 36 writers and 200,000 people in their forums generating 1m page views a month.\nTeachable – London, UK.\nAfter bootstapping for 18 months these guys sell bundles of credits for teachers to download ready-made Powerpoints, worksheets etc. Contributing teachers get a 50% share of this download income. Upload more teaching resorces and you get to download more. The issue is that Teachers don’t want to share their hard-won notes and classes ideas and people don’t have tine and the reosurces to do it, but if you get a community – especially a young facebook generation of teachers – and you have a model.\nVouChaCha – London, UK.\nA location based voucher delivery service for your mobile, we wrote about them recently.\nhttp://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/09/02/voucherhub-launches-people-powered-site/ . They’ve now signed LastMinute.com as a client. VoucherCodes, VoucherHub, Savoo And Savings.com are all potential competitors but their emphasis on an iPhone app (and Andorid coming) is probably going to play in their favour.\nWondergraphs – Leuven, Belgium.\nThis is browser based graphing. You can drag and drop algityhmns to compare and contrast data and share the graphs in public and private. They have interest from a “major” company. Thinking of SAAS or commercial license model. Team has worked for Oracle and similar.\nWorld on a Hanger – London, UK.\nThe Fashion industry has to deliver on time, with geographically dispersed teams, with a lack of integrated solutions. So it needs an ERP solution for them. But it needs to be on demand / pay as you go. And SAAS. So this is a feature rich, hosted solution for fashion labels. Nice interface nice for the fashion indusry. Team has eexperience in fashion industry. CTO built Rentability.com holiday rentals site. Online Marketplace for fashion industry.\nYubiTech – Ramat Gan, Israel.\nThis is about constantly being able to access you data and documents on a mobile Users drag and drop documents into to a wizard. They can do quick migration to any mobile OS and have a number of Israel companies interested in their solution. YubiTech Drag & Drop Wizard enables companies to smartly port their applications to any SmartPhone OS. YubiTech will be sold as a SaaS for companies, through direct sales & OEM. The business model will be derived from a licensee fee (per application, per user, per month).\nKwaga – France.\nThis helps you priortise email and gmail. Based on a semantic platform, Kwaga sorts your emails with easy to pick-up icons (categorization) and extracts key facts for you to prioritise. The demo looks pretty awesome and this looks like a very interesting company. It also detects “intrinsic urgency of mails”. Revenue models: Freemium and B2B.\nPlatogo (a social gaming network) from Austria who were winners of Mini Seedcamp program earlier in the year. Platogo applies user-generated content and community to browser-based casual gaming. Users can also be producers, creating and sharing their own game levels. Game developers also create games and get revenue shares. Revenue is driven by sales to users (e.g. in-game features via micropayments) and advertising options, both on the website and inside games. To be honest, the platform looks pretty awesome. P2P online games creation platform where users create their own levels. Very much about challenging others to play your levels, so potentially addictive.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Users create their own personal Scouts, for example one for their blog, another for their Facebook or similar profile, and the scouts “walk through the Internet,” by meeting other Scouts with similar interests or profiles, creating a contact between both.\nResults from the Scouts are constantly being compared, delivering a realtime guide that allows users to see which blog on a certain topic, in a certain language or country is most relevant to the user at a specific moment. Users can also create networks based on specific topics or personal groups and see who is best ranked within these networks.\nAutomation\nThe interesting thing about Scoutle is not that its another social networking service, it’s the focus on automation. Little input is required from users to make connections, the Scouts do most (if not all) of the work usually needed to participate in any social networking site. Users can sit back and simply choose whether to visit the profiles delivered via new connections.\nWe’ve seen various link swapping/ promotional/ blog traffic systems before, however Scoutle’s move into social networking is an interesting mix, sort of StumbleUpon based on a shared interests, profiles and widgets.

The PowerVision lenses apparently respond to natural muscular forces in the eye, which presumably squish around liquid in the lens to alter its shape and thereby change focus.\nThe new funding should carry PowerVision a third of the way through its clinical trials, which it expects to begin in late 2008 or early 2009.

The company claims to have a million subscribers in Israel and Europe, and plans to quintuple that number in 2008.\nUnlike Microsoft’s HealthVault, which we reviewed here and here , LifeOnKey charges individuals to store their medical info. A basic plan starts at $50 a year, plus a $5 registration fee and another one-time $20 fee to activate a USB key-based security system. Premium plans that regularly collect, scan and incorporate paper-based medical info, among other things, cost an unspecified additional amount.\nI haven’t had a chance to see what the service itself looks like, but I hope to take a closer look before long.

According to Gasgoo's analysis, the total sales volume of global EVs in 2015 has risen 72.8% year-on-year. Closer to home, the EV sales in China has reached 207,382 units, beating the US to rank first world-wide. The rapidly rising popularity has propelled growth in the global lithium battery industry in multiples. Even conservative estimates have the global market for lithium batteries hitting US$100 billion in the coming decade.\nChina, with the combination of technology and production ability, is in a unique position of leading the world EV production and market. Analysts predict that by year 2020, even 100 1GWh battery factories would probably not fulfill the large needs of China's EV market alone, creating tremendous room for growth.\nNot surprisingly, capital markets are eagerly eyeing the electric vehicle market in China. The explosive growth in 2015 has attracted intensive investment from listed companies. Reporters based in China are investigating leads about a few local lithium battery manufacturers engaged in substantial business activity. According to informed sources, two major global investment banks have contacted the leading EV cell provider Boston Power early this year pitching for the listing business, and have proposed an initial valuation in the range of US$8-13 billion. Other financial institutions are also following the situation closely with clear hopes to benefit before its IPO. With a valuation this large, a few skeptical investors regard the valuation as too high. However, as one expert puts it, the core value can be found in their technology edge, production capability and clientele. Following this logic, Boston Power is backed by its two research centers at Boston, Massachusetts US and Beijing, China and customer wins for over 30 types of EV models from likes of Dongfeng, Geely (Xindayang), Nanjing Golden Dragon, etc; coupled with its three production bases in Jiangsu, Taiwan and Lanzhou, China.\nAt the beginning of 2016, a government work report has clearly stated \"the construction of more battery-charging facilities for new energy vehicles\". In a similar vein, China's State Council has also proposed \"assigning top priority to revolutionary battery technology as one of the five measures to support the new energy vehicle industry\". If said were true, Boston Power's timing could not be better.\nReporters tried to contact Mr. Alex Pan, President of Boston Power, but did not receive any replies regarding to the IPO. However, a relevant source confirmed that Boston Power has set up an internal IPO team to manage the listing process; also, besides the US, Hong Kong is also one of the bourses being evaluated by the company.\nTopic: Press release summary\n", "deleted" : false }

They’re worth reading, here .\n—–\nFelicis Ventures Closes on $20o Million, Roughly Doubling Its Last Fund\nWhen we first met Aydin Senkut in 2006, it was just months after he’d resigned from Google, where he was a senior manager responsible for strategic partner development in Asia Pacific. He was among a small number of “Googlaires” who had lots of money, great connections, and the ability to see many web startups before traditional VCs.\nIn fact, many in the industry viewed Senkut and his ilk as arrivistes, and Senkut has been on his unwavering mission since, first to first impress them, then to surpass them. His execution has been pretty spot on, too. Felicis Ventures , the San Francisco-based firm that he founded 10 years ago and he now manages with three other investors, just closed its fifth fund with $200 million. That’s nearly double the amount Felicis gathered up for its fourth fund less than two years ago.\nInstitutions are writing out big checks left and right these days. But it’s easy to understand why Felicis’s limited partners were particularly open to providing the firm with more capital. Felicis has invested in 180 startups to date. Three of those companies have gone public, including Fitbit and Shopify. At least three others — Credit Karma , Planet Labs , and Adyen — appear positioned to go public.\nMeanwhile, another 60 companies in Felicis’s portfolio have enjoyed what Senkut calls “meaningful exits.” Most meaningful, seemingly, Felicis was an early investor in Cruise Automation, which is being acquired by General Motors for more than $1 billion; it backed the cloud infrastructure startup Meraki, acquired by Cisco for $1.2 billion in cash; it invested in Twitch, acquired by Amazon for $970 million in cash; and it backed Climate Corp., which Monsanto bought for roughly $930 million.\nIf you’re wondering about the number of companies that have flamed out after receiving a check from Felicis, Senkut says it’s is in the “very low digits; it’s in the teens percentage on a dollar-adjusted basis.”\nWhen we talked earlier this week, Senkut suggested Felicis’s success so far owes to what he characterizes as a unique strategy.\n—–\nNew Fundings\nAcorns, a four-year-old, Newport Beach, Ca.-based robo advisory company whose app targets young investors, making it simple for them to buy into a diversified group of exchange-traded funds, has raised $30 million in funding from PayPal, with participation from the Rakuten Tech Fund.

People generally use Jangl to place calls or SMSs to other web surfers without exchanging your real number. The new advertising initiative is called Mobile Media Platform and provides a set of APIs for publishers and ad units for advertisers. The strategy is similar to steps other widget providers have taken to finally make some money off their network by tying in advertisements.\nThrough the APIs, developers can integrate bits of Jangl’s SMS and VOIP calling functionality into their applications. In exchange, Jangl expands its advertising reach a bit further. The monetization side is being handled in partnership with Pudding Media, and Ogilvy’s Digital Innovation Group. Jangl will have several different types of ad units for advertisers, such as SMS ads tacked on to messages users send and pre-roll audio ads that play during the time you’d normally spend listening to the phone ring. Advertisers can target the ads by keyword, category, location, and demographics.

(Sci-Hub)\nShare\nNikhil Sonnad\nFebruary 14, 2016\nDigital piracy is not all about movies and music—pretty much anything that people feel is unfairly priced will find its way online in large numbers. Even academic papers.\nIn October 2015, a New York district court ruled in favor of the academic publisher Elsevier, which had accused Sci-Hub, a website that offers pirated versions of academic papers, of copyright violation. That decision allowed authorities to take down the site’s domain name, sci-hub.org.\nSuspending a domain name does not delete a website forever, though, it just prevents visitors from knowing where exactly to find it. It’s trivial enough to relaunch the same site under another domain, as Sci-Hub did, setting up as sci-hub.io . Now knowledge of the new domain has spread far and wide, with mentions of it showing up across social networks like Reddit and Hacker News , and with coverage in publications like Big Think and The Atlantic (our sister publication).\nSci-Hub’s tagline is “to remove all barriers in the way of science.” It was created by Alexandra Elbakyan, a neuroscience researcher from Kazakhstan, and is effectively an automated version of the #icanhazpdf hashtag . Most academic papers are behind some kind of paywall, coming out to around $30 per paper, according to one estimate . In the manual way of getting around this, someone tweets a link to a paper along with their email address and the hashtag #icanhazpdf. Someone else, who has access to the paper, perhaps through a subscription or their university, then downloads and emails the paper to them.\nSci-Hub, on the other hand, takes a link to a paper and automatically tries credentials for various universities until it manages to gain access to the paper, retrieving the PDF. This method gives it access to more information than any individual researcher or institution, and Sci-Hub estimates its total access at 47 million papers.\nThe new domain will be hard for a US-based lawsuit, like Elsevier’s from last year, to shut down. The US only has jurisdiction over registrars based in the US, such as .com, .net, and .org. The trendy .io domain is actually registered to the British Indian Ocean Territory, meaning the UK would have to act, as happened with PopcornTime.io , the Netflix-for-pirates .\nBut as The Atlantic points out, Sci-Hub will be able to survive any number of domain seizures thanks to its existence on the “dark web.” Accessing the site in this way, through the distributed Tor network, does not involve any centralized registry, meaning there is no single entity that authorities can shut down.\nThe main beneficiaries of Sci-Hub are outside of the US, like the site’s creator herself. The traffic figures from Alexa.com , though only a crude estimate, list users from China, Iran, India, Brazil, and Russia as the top visitors to sci-hub.io, with the US outside the top five. While even Harvard has said it can’t afford the steep prices of some publishers, most American universities offer relatively robust access, and researchers may be able to afford the $30 or so it usually costs to purchase a paper.\n“For me, even the purchase of one such article would be a financial setback,” Alexandra told Russia Today via email. “So I had to go about acquiring all the articles by pirate means.”\nRead full story\n", "deleted" : false }

After our selection, the companies pay a fee to present. Our coverage of them remains objective.\nWorkface, which provides an online service that helps companies interact with their customers with text- and video-chat services, is launching today at the DEMO Spring 2011 conference.\nWorkface gives employees at a company additional ways to interact with their customers. The software adds a toolbar to websites that shows how many sales associates are available and lets customers interact with them directly by chatting with them or viewing profiles. The software also gives companies some analytical tools to figure out which strategies for interacting with customers are working.\nThe company also has mobile-chat applications that lets employees chat with potential customers through a mobile device. The application is available for Apple devices and phones running on BlackBerry and Android mobile operating systems. Sales associates can also start video chats from their mobile devices if they have a front-facing camera, similar to Apple’s consumer-oriented FaceTime application.\nCustomer support for the service is hands-off as well, since the service is run on remote servers — or cloud-based servers. The software costs $25 per user per month, and any technical woes are handled by Workface. So companies interested in the software don’t have to hire additional IT professionals to handle any software woes that crop up.\nWorkface has raised $1.9 million to date from the founders, angel investors and Arthur Ventures. The Minneapolis, Minn.-based company was founded in 2007 and has 5 full-time employees, as well as some contract workers. The company is led by Leif Larson, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin’s business school. He was formerly the CEO of Kiosk.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPress Releases\n", "deleted" : false }

Starting on Sunday, the update will first roll out to the Sony Internet TV units with the Logitech Revue units getting it shortly thereafter. Existing users will probably love the update as it brings a redesigned interface and a selection of the Android Market. It seems to be exactly what the platform should have been when it launched last year. But for everyone else, either those looking to cut the cord or supplement pay TV with Internet video, it’s still a tough sell. All the downfalls associated with Google TV a year ago still exist. While the system might not be half-baked anymore, I’m still not sure if Google TV deserves a place in your living room.\nA Fresh Coat Of Paint\nThe first version of Google TV was a mess. The user interface was inconsistent between screens and often slow in operation. The search screen used a completely different interface and the home screen wasn’t designed for TV. Like most first generation Google products, it felt like a beta.\nThe old, cluttered Google TV home screen\nThe new, cleaner Google TV home screen\nThe Google TV team started anew and used Android as a design template. I can’t speak to its operation as I’m waiting for the update myself, but from the screens and demos I’ve seen, the new interface is completely different and it finally looks like a proper 10-foot interface. The home screen now features just a single row of customizable icons. It houses the most used apps along with a handy clock and link to notifications. The app screen now uses a more natural grid arrangement rather than a list and the Android Market looks straight out of Honeycomb. But with all the UI changes, the Google TV engineers spent the most time on improving content discovery.\nGoogle TV was never designed for cord cutters. It’s designed to live alongside paid TV, but present Internet video and apps in a seamless experience. The original Google TV search app was an amazing tool, but a tool gimped after big media’s blockade of free streaming websites. That’s where the new TV & Movies app comes in.\nTV & Movies\nTV & Movies\nIt’s All About The Apps\nThink of the TV & Movie app as a new guide. It attempts to bring together cable/satellite content with programming from the major paid streaming services. Better yet, it’s smart, presenting results based on viewing history and preferences. Say you want to watch Boardwalk Empire. The guide presents all the available viewing options: Your TV provider’s HBO channel naturally, but also HBO Go, and Netflix or Amazon if they’re available. This information is presented in a gorgeous grid view enhanced with cover art and additional information. During a chat I had last week with Google TV’s head, Mario Queiroz, he indicated that the team’s goal is to provide an API for this service with the intent to improve the search experience even more.\nAndroid Market was missing from the product since launch and is part of the latest update. The Market will only feature Android apps that can actually work on a TV and do not require specific hardware like a touchscreen. 30 apps out of the 800 launching will be featured including CNBC, Fox News Business, Zillow, and Aol HD — so, you know, apps you probably won’t use. Mario indicated to me that HTML 5 Google TV apps are not segregated from standard Android apps since to the user, they’re still apps. Smart.\nThe New YouTube App\nYouTube Leanback\nYouTube has always been a big part of Google TV and the new version launches with a completely redesigned Leanback YouTube app exclusive to the platform. Windows Media Center users should feel right at home. The app is a virtual clone of Microsoft’s aging HTPC program. Down the left side is a list of shortcuts while a clean title layout is used for the content including what appears, at least from the screenshots, to be the upcoming YouTube Channels. The new YouTube app was developed after the GTV team discovered that users used YouTube twice as much as expected (probably because big media blocked its free content).\nGoogle + is eventually coming to Google TV and could potentially save the platform from the deadpool. Of course, Google + might need a life-preserver too. Mario explained that Google +’s social tools fit neatly within the Google TV team charter. Everything from sharing photos to TV discovery could be a social experience and the team is working closely with the kids from Google + to integrate all the functionality. When Google + hits GTV — Google isn’t announcing a timetable yet — it could become a must-have for fans of the social network. Sharing media is one of Google + strengths and could play neatly into Google TV.\nThe new Google TV hardware finally seems ready for consumers but I’m not sure it’s the best platform for the job. The first version was a mishmash of design elements, obtrusive interfaces and strange navigation paths. The new interface looks great, and likely feels more natural, but Google TV is still hampered by big media. The update only addresses hardware and software issues — stuff a team of engineers can control. Unfortunately Google TV didn’t take off the first time because of a larger fundamental issue that still hasn’t been addressed.\nThe Original App List\nThe New App Menu\nA History Lesson\nGoogle TV was the tech media’s darling product last fall. It was supposed to be the next big thing, simultaneously beating Apple in the living room while disrupting how TV is consumed. Logitech predicted it would ship 500k of its $299 Revue Google TV units. Sony was the first out of the gate with the Internet TV ( MG hated the remote ) followed by the Logitech model a few weeks later.\nThe early reviews almost universally loved it, but then big media struck . Suddenly ABC, NBC, and CBS shut out Google TV, with FOX and the other networks following suit. Hulu, Fancast, and all the other aggregate streaming sites were locked out, too. It was never designed to be the cord-cutter’s set-top box but at least before it first launched, it seemed like the perfect Hulu streamer. Without this content, Google TV became a glorified YouTube/Netflix box, a very hard sell at $299 when similar devices where selling for $99.\nJust weeks after launch, the platform that had showed so much promise was treading water, just trying to stay afloat. Google TV quickly faded into obscurity and Logitech eventually cut the Revue’s price by 2/3 down to $99. The bad press at its launch effectively burned Google TV the first time around and I’m not sure this new coat of paint will cover the ashes.\nLook for a full Google TV 2.0 review in the coming days. The significant update warrants another look at the platform. However, even though I’m sure Google TV now runs like a champ, it still doesn’t look more user friendly than Roku’s interface and the Boxee Box still access to all the free content blocked from Google TV. Then for the Apple user, an Apple TV provides an awesome unified experience. There still isn’t any notable features exclusive to Google TV.\nGoogle TV is still stuck. This latest update brings a ton of features along with an improved interface. But it doesn’t add content and, well, content is king. Google is announcing today that new hardware is coming next year from Samsung, Vizio and other unannounced partners. The new units will use more powerful chipsets, which will probably make Google TV silky smooth. But Hulu and all the rest will likely still be blocked on this new hardware, too, leaving Google TV as… a glorified YouTube/Netflix box. Again.\nBonus! Google just posted more demo videos of the new apps. The new overview video is below and the rest are here .\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

While at the company, she reported directly to cofounder Sergey Brin.\nAlthough an Oculus spokesperson would not elaborate on what  Jepsen  will be doing at the Facebook-owned virtual-reality technology developer, it’s a safe bet it’s something high-level and strategic. In her past, which included a stint as one of the very first group of students at the MIT Media Lab, and later a professorship there, she was the cofounder and CTO of the One Laptop Per Child project. That project aimed to make laptops available to children for about $100 each.\nHer work also led her to be named one of the “ Time 100 ” in 2008, essentially ranking her among the hundred most influential people on the planet, as well as being listed as one of the 50 greatest female computer scientists of all time by the Anita Borg Institute.\nAccording to Time, she was the co-creator of the world’s first holographic video system, in 1989.\nHer penchant for taking moonshots may be a coincidence, but Jepsen was also a NASA fellow from 1992 to 1994, during which time she designed a new anti-glare illumination system for the space shuttle, according to her resume.\nOver her last couple of years at Google, Jepsen was involved in building the company’s follow-up to Google Glass. However, it’s not yet known what that is.\nJepsen’s joining Oculus makes a lot of sense, given her long history with display technology. In addition to work at the MIT Media Lab, Google X, and now Oculus, she also was founder, CTO, CEO, and then board member of Pixel Qi , a company whose “mission is to catalyze the massive LCD manufacturing industry to faster innovation via the first truly fab­less effort in the industry.”\nHer hiring was first reported by GigaOm .\nAI.

The company typically positions itself as an innovator, but it’s hard to do that when Amazon is already innovating quickly, and the company’s product catalog isn’t as large as that of its competitors.\n\"I’ve never felt that Google has put the level of effort necessary into this market to be a winner,” she said in an interview. \nWhat’s more, Google hasn’t put as much effort as its competitors into building out an enterprise sales and support force, which is compounded by the fact that the ecosystem of partners built up around Google Cloud Platform isn’t as robust as AWS’s or Microsoft Azure’s. \nDave Bartoletti, a principal analyst at Forrester, said in an email that the biggest challenge facing Google in the cloud wars is proving itself to enterprises. \nWatch Now\nWinging it with the Chroma and Dragonfly drones\n\"Cloud is already proven as the best place to quickly build exciting new web and mobile applications, but the next wave of cloud spending will be driven by large enterprises moving significant portions of their applications to the cloud,\" he said in an email. \"To reach these enterprise customers, Google needs marketing, sales, and channels designed to reach big companies, not consumers.\"\nThat change is already in progress. Google hired Diane Greene, the co-founder and ex-CEO of VMware, to take over its business-focused products, including the cloud platform, and she has been pushing to improve the company’s standing with enterprises.\nJack Clark at Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the company is working on growing its enterprise sales channels, and that cloud chief Diane Greene took part in a recent customer meeting with partner SADA Systems. SADA’s CEO reportedly said that was the first time a Google executive of her stature has done so in nine years. \nIf Google can better pitch its services to enterprises and build out additional products, it has tremendous potential behind it. Quizlet, a San Francisco-based education startup, moved all of its infrastructure over to GCP.\nThe company’s pricing schemes (which avoid long-term contracts in favor of discounts for continued use) played a role in Quizlet's decision to move from Joyent, but Quizlet Platform Lead Peter Bakkum said that the ultimate decision came down to a belief that Google’s core technology is better than that of the competition.\nBakkum’s confidence is a key sign of what could be in Google’s future. Urs Hölzle, its senior vice president for technical infrastructure, expects the company’s public cloud business to overtake the advertising revenue that makes up the overwhelming majority of the money Google makes. \nWhat remains to be seen is if the company can live up to that prediction. \nRELATED TOPICS\n", "deleted" : false }

And this is true--if those networks are Verizon-contracted roaming networks. And if you are willing to pay a premium price to use them.\nThe Age of Hotspots\nA mobile Wi-Fi hotspot is one of the easiest ways to bring mobile Internet service to a variety of portable devices. Since Wi-Fi is a universal standard built into almost every laptop, netbook, portable game player, tablet, and smartphone being manufactured today, a mobile hotspot makes the mobile Internet available just about everywhere to all of these devices, almost everywhere.\nSadly, all of these hotspots are limited to a specific carrier and cellular technology--which is frustrating for global travelers who would like the same access to the mobile Internet anywhere in the world there is cellular service. It’s particularly frustrating for Verizon customers since the version of 3G used by Verizon in North America--CDMA Rev. A--is only poorly available in a world dominated by the other version of 3G--GSM.\nGlobal Promise\nThe Fivespot (made by ZTE) is a global version of the mobile hotspot, supporting both major versions of 3G technology--CDMA and GSM--and laying the foundation for Verizon’s claim to provide global data service in over 200 countries, with more than 120 of these at 3G speeds.\nThe Fivespot is a small, compact device measuring 3.92 by 2.11by 0.55 inches. It supports the two major global cellular data technologies: CDMA 1xEvDO Rev. A/Rev. 0 (the core Verizon North American service) and the worldwide GSM standards of GSM/GPRS/EDGE and WCDMA/HSDPA/HSUPA.\nThe Fivespot has a good, robust feature set that serves not only basic but also more sophisticated mobile hotspot applications. It can be used both as a Wi-Fi hotspot and as a USB tethered modem to a laptop.\nIt has an internal battery to provide up to 4 hours of mobile hotspot service for up to five Wi-Fi users. The battery can be recharged via a separate charger or for road warriors via a mini USB cable from a laptop.\nMessy Setup\nSetup is a more complex than necessary. The need to use a laptop to activate the device limits the Fivespot’s utility for tablet and smartphone users who don't have, or wish to use, a laptop. The Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200 sets the standard for ease of setup--it requires nothing more than a browser on a Wi-Fi-connected smart device to activate and use the mobile hotspot.\nTo set up the device, we attached the included USB cable to a laptop and then installed Verizon’s VZAccess software. This software is available for most versions of Windows and Mac OS X and comes on internal Fivespot storage--eliminating the need for a software installation CD.\nVZAccess is then used in the Fivespot’s USB wired tethering mode to activate the device on the Verizon CDMA network--essentially as a USB 3G modem for the laptop.\nOnce activated, the Fivespot is disconnected from the laptop. After you power it down and start it up, it functions as a Wi-Fi hotspot. The Fivespot’s Wi-Fi default SSID and password (printed on the bottom of the device) quickly gives browser access to the configuration Web pages of the device.\nThe default configuration is perfectly adequate, and once powered up, the Fivespot delivered a high performance bubble of Verizon mobile Internet with no further configuring. The Fivespot provides a full range of firewall and VPN features for more sophisticated applications.\nSolid Performance\nWe put the Fivespot through an unusually rigorous performance testing regime--several hundred performance tests with an assortment of Wi-Fi devices in a variety of indoor and outdoor locations in San Francisco.\nThe device delivered outstanding 3G performance on Verizon’s 3G CDMA Rev. A network, matching the performance of the category-defining Novatel MiFi and exceeding the performance of several smartphones that double as mobile hotspots.\nWe found that the laptop reliably had over 1.5 megabits per second in average download speed via Wi-Fi, but that an iPhone 3GS, an iPad, and Sprint's HTC Hero all achieved only 80 percent of that speed. We suspect that there is some performance issue here with handheld devices, as we have seen a similar throughput problem with other mobile WAN gateways.\nWe wanted to test the Fivespot not just in CDMA mode, but in GSM mode, as it would be overseas. However, when we tried to replace the Verizon-provided SIM with a data SIM from another carrier, it would not work. We suspect that this is Verizon’s way of making sure you activate the Verizon SIM for roaming when you go overseas.\nThe Catch: Steep Costs\nThe Fivespot is available from Verizon Wireless for $99.99 (after a $100 mail-in rebate) with a two-year contract. Domestic data plans run from $20 for 1GB per month to $80 per month for 10GB of data. Fair enough.\nYour problems begin when you decide you want to use the Fivespot outside the United States--the raison d'etre of the device. It would be nice to pop in a (prepaid) SIM card from the local GSM service wherever you happen to be, native data access being far less expensive than roaming access. But Verizon doesn't allow you to insert other carriers’ SIM cards into the Fivespot for GSM/EDGE/UMTS/HSPA service.\nYou're forced to buy out-of-country data access via Verizon’s (often substantially more expensive) mobile data roaming plans. If you are already paying for such service for your global-ready phone, you can't use the SIM from the phone in your Fivespot; the Fivespot has to have its own dedicated SIM.\nThe international data roaming plans give you a low monthly data usage allowance, at a high monthly price, and with high overage rates. Here are the two month-to-month plans available :\nThe $129.99 per month plan gets you only 100MB of data access per month. Do a few movie uploads or video chat sessions, and before you know it you're at your limit. And at that point, you face a $5.12 charge for every megabit of data you go over. In the U.S. and Canada, the plan buys you 5GB of data per month, with a 5-cent charge for every megabit of data you go over your plan.\nA $219.99 per month plan gets you 200MB of data service overseas, and 5GB per month of data service in the U.S. and Canada. The overage penalty rates are the same as the $129.99 plan.\nThe pay-as-you-go plan for less-frequent global travelers may sound like a good deal, but it has its own perils. First of all, this plan requires that you already have a $60/month domestic data service contract with Verizon.\nThe real problem is the cost of data roaming. From the Verizon Wireless FAQ: \"PLEASE NOTE: Data Roaming while travelling outside of the U.S. will incur charges as high as $20.48/MB.\" So that 32MB MP3 file you pulled down from your Drop.io account during your vacation overseas may have cost you $655.36.\n$655.36! Hope you enjoyed it.\nThere’s got to be a better way. Wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper just to buy a GSM hotspot from a vending machine in the airport when you land at your destination country? For instance, for a week-long trip to Spain, you could buy a prepaid SIM card locally from Orange, and end up paying about $34 for a week of 3G access. But this is the rate for connecting a single device, like an iPad , not for connecting a hotspot.\nConclusion\nThe Fivespot is the forerunner of a new generation of mobile devices that have the innate capability to work on more than one network technology, and on more than one carrier. New mobile hotspots and smartphones with these capabilities will begin to appear in the first half of 2011. And we can hope that the cost of connecting all around the world with a single device will become much less expensive.\nThere's nothing wrong with the technology inside ZTE's Fivespot. The device plainly illustrates how, for now, our ability to enjoy the promise of anywhere/anytime Internet access is limited not by technology but by the business model of the carrier.\nRelated:\n", "deleted" : false }

As I wait, I cannot shake his eerie resemblance to Mark Zuckerberg. It’s not just his curly hair, the hoodie, the strangely similar necks and chins. It’s the fact that this teenager is wicked smart with serious ambition. He wants to change the world.\n“Worried parents,” he sighs as he hangs up the phone. “They live in Houston. They always like to know where I am and what I am doing.”\nWhat he’s doing is remarkable for someone his age. He is co-founding a startup called One , which has created a mobile app that notifies you when people around you share your interests. You create a profile, and when someone with similar interests is right next to you, you get a notification. Levy and his co-founder, 28 year old Michael Callahan, have the ambitious goal of making missed connections history.\n“How do we meet the important people in our lives?” asks Levy. “It’s all about situations. I like tennis, and met my best friend because he was carrying a racket. We started talking because of that racket. What if he hadn’t been carrying it that day? We want to prevent people from walking past each other and missing a chance to know each other.”\nThe app makes its initial debut at the end of this month at UC Berkeley, when students get back to school. He’s timed the launch carefully, so it will be available after the noise of signing up for classes and extracurricular activities has quieted.\n“You need a large number of users in a small geographic area, so we’re focusing on college campuses,” explains Levy. “We’re going from campus to campus. We are emulating what Facebook did. Why did Color launch to everyone? Why are all of these companies trying to build a network by launching publicly? Exclusivity is key.”\nColor is a good analogy. Like One, the startup is focused on making connections between people based on physical proximity. The fuse was lit when Color raised $41 million earlier this year. The result was more of a fizzle than a ka-boom. Early reviews indicated users weren’t as excited as a $41 million company should make them. It still hasn’t taken off. One will also face competition from apps like WhosHere and Skout .\nAfter Berkeley, One will launch at University of Texas and University of Illinois. One tracked invite requests on its site to see which schools got picked.\nThe company raised $1 million from SV Angel, True Ventures, Charles River Ventures, General Catalyst, Square COO Keith Rabois, wine guru and marketing consultant Gary Vaynerchuk, serial entrepreneur Naval Ravikant and Harrison Metal founder Michael Dearing.\nDearing doesn’t talk to the press very often. A current Stanford professor and former senior vice president at eBay, Dearing has quietly backed innovative and successful startups. His greatest hits include AdMob (Google acquired for $750 million), Xoopit (Yahoo bought for $20 million), Mixer Labs (Twitter acquired) along with other startups like Widgetbox, CafePress, Polyvore and BloomSpot. You’ll be hard-pressed to find him talk publically about himself or these companies.\nIn this case, he was happy to talk.\n“Three people in the same week told me to meet him,” says Dearing with a chuckle, recalling how he met Levy. “He’s got charisma and the courage to use it. He reaches out to people and is self confident in the best way. He finds interesting people and interesting things to talk about. He can connect with people and that deep desire is reflected in his product.”\nI ask if he can find something negative to say about Levy.\n“He’s the real thing,” says Dearing. This validation from Dearing is one of the best you can get in Silicon Valley. “You can’t do what he’s done at his age without intense focus and discipline. The reason you haven’t been able to find red flags is he hasn’t had much time to accumulate them.”\nLevy spent one year at University of Illinois studying computer science, where the university had recruited him for his entrepreneur talents, he says, “just like an athlete.” But what he was really studying was how to sell himself and his ideas. He did an independent study with Paul Magelli, the senior director of the Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership at U of I. Magelli is also scholar in residence at Kauffman Foundation, advising on entrepreneurship initiatives.\n“Cory is ‘the’ mythical example we use in class, except he’s for real,” says Magelli, as he puts down his Chicago-style hot dog to do an interview. He’s just landed in Chicago, and called as soon as this interview was requested. “I’ve been teaching for 57 years and you wonder when in your career you’ll get a Cory. He makes you rethink the proposition as to whether entrepreneurs are born or made. He’s so young. How did he absorb it in 19 years? He’s an enigma.”\nLevy says he’s taking a break from school to work on One. He’s not sure how long that break will last.\nNext Page:\n", "deleted" : false }

As yet, there’s limited use of the channel globally and relatively few trading desks around the world are demanding such access. I’m not the only one who believes that the programmatic direct channel faces strong headwinds .\nPersonally, I believe the issues are partly due to the first-mover advantage and the size of market that real-time bidding (RTB) systems currently represent. Mention “programmatic” and most will still think of campaigns bought through RTB, and for good reason: Of the estimated $14.2 billion spent via programmatic channels in 2015, RTB accounted for 81%, according to Magna Global .\nOne of the primary benefits of the programmatic direct marketplace is its utility when booking campaigns using nonstandard ad creative. In particular, the drive for more native ad formats – which often require customization and offline negotiation – has until now necessitated more direct relationships than most programmatic platforms permit.\nYet RTB systems are also introducing more unique and native formats , which challenge this benefit of the programmatic direct channel. If ad buyers are increasingly able to attain the scale of RTB platforms, albeit using nonstandard campaigns, that will be a significant limitation to the growth of the programmatic direct channel.\nMore importantly, RTB systems are already starting to emulate some of the programmatic direct channel’s campaign performance benefits by enabling new campaign controls and criteria within private marketplaces. Following “revelations” that most digital ads never have a chance to be seen , RTB systems have had to respond to the demands of huge ad buyers, such as GroupM and Unilever, which required specific viewability performance criteria for every single ad impression.\nSome private RTB marketplaces are already testing selling ad inventory on a viewable cost per mille (VCPM) basis. Initial experience from these systems suggests that advertisers are often willing to compromise on the amount of impressions they buy, and even the media titles their ads appear on, in return for premium viewability. That’s a significant strategy shift from the most common RTB approach to ad buying, which prioritizes attaining the largest number of impressions for the available budget.\nMany other key performance indicators, including optimum page positions, combinations of targeting data and ad-block whitelisted formats, are also becoming available to ad buyers through RTB systems. As these platforms are sharing data on specific ad inventory’s past performance across numerous criteria, buyers are beginning to change their perception of RTB marketplaces as merely a place for cheap impressions, and starting to distinguish certain formats as qualitatively more valuable than others.\nThat change in perception will soon be matched by a change in price, much to the appreciation of publishers that have experienced falling CPM rates since entering the programmatic marketplace. Ads that perform well will be priced higher, but the price of poorly performing ad formats will continue to decline. The inventory that is 100% viewable, displayed at precisely the right time to qualified users within relevant, brand-safe content that the consumer likes, trusts and enjoys will be prized and achieve an appropriate price.\nPoorly performing inventory will remain unsold or priced so low that publishers are forced to finally admit that the amount they’re earning from certain industry standard ad formats is just not cutting it. That’s when they’ll remove them from their sites. And that’s the true opportunity for the programmatic direct channel.\nMany tech vendors make a comparison between the automation of the programmatic ad industry and the financial industry’s stock exchanges. The RTB channels are equated with the financial industry’s spot market, and the programmatic direct channel with the futures market.\nHowever, there’s a huge difference between the digital ad industry and the stock market. There are actual, tangible limits on the stock available in the stock market. There are only so many shares available in a company and only so much oil in barrels and so much gold. This means that pre-purchasing months and years in advance can actually be a necessity.\nAt present, the supply of digital ad space is pretty much infinite. Only when the publishing industry starts to remove poorly performing, uneconomic ad inventory from its media titles will the process of limiting the supply of ad inventory begin. That will give a far more relevant role to the programmatic direct channel.\nThe sell side will never be able to act like OPEC does with oil – US and EU competition law and anti-cartel measures will prevent that – but when it starts to naturally limit the availability of ad inventory because it’s uneconomic, there will be more desire for a futures approach to digital ad buying. That is unlikely to be accomplished in the near future, however.\nNone of this means there won’t be notable developments in the programmatic direct channels. Moves to integrate ad booking systems with automated platforms are just one development that could give the programmatic direct market a significant boost.\nHowever, for now, the focus of players in the programmatic industry will continue to be on developing the capabilities of the RTB marketplace first, so that buyers can more easily identify and purchase the truly premium inventory that is being made available there.\nFollow Vibrant Media ( @VibrantMedia ) and AdExchanger ( @adexchanger ) on Twitter.\n", "deleted" : false }

I make coffee. And I kind of read email and wake up the kids. But I try not to be super-rushed in the morning.‬\nWhat is one thing about your job that you think would surprise people?\nHow small the teams are—and how deeply effective they are, even though they're small. \nWhat's your favorite Twitter or Instagram account and why?\nThere are a couple I like a lot. I really like what Marc Andreessen says.\nHow do you keep track of everything you have to do? Can you send us a snapshot of your to-do list?\nI'm constantly writing or drawing. I have different notebooks, and I am sort of famous for them. I draw and write in my notebook.\nWhat are some things you do to refresh your mind when you're in a rut?\nSometimes I go different places. One of the things is, for me, my job is so broad that I'm constantly moving topics. Traveling around. Context switch. Whether it's doing different things within the city I'm living in or being with different communities. I like to see what this group of people are doing or what that group. Shift context and location. There's a really cool place—Chautauqua. My mom used to run the children's school there. There are lots of different topics people are talking about. So it's a good refresh place. It's like a TED conference founded in the 1870s. My mom lives there now. All my cousins go. We all go. They'll do biotech and then the Civil War. Edison was there. Mostly for me, I think it's just good to context-switch a lot, and I do that a lot in my job—work on different topics.\nWho outside of your field inspires you the most and why?\nAn Omidyar fellow, Forest Frizzell, in Honolulu. All the people in county jail were all being put through one person. The system is a disaster. Everybody was missing court dates. He fixed it.\nBonus Round: Hillary Hartley\nWhere or how do you seek out creative inspiration?\nA lot of times it's physical. I like to go to museums. I have a ton of creative and designer-y friends. Twitter is flooded with things that I bookmark.\nWhat is one thing about your job that you think would surprise people?\nHow collaborative our team is. When we hit the walls of bureaucracy, we're generally able to figure out how to get over and around them. It's such a pleasure to work with such awesome partners.\nWhat's your favorite Twitter or Instagram account and why?\nThere's two. I just got turned on to Humans of New York . I love it. I am totally addicted. The other one is the two guys that act out famous paintings. It's amazing. Fools Do Art .\nWhat are some things you do to refresh your mind when you're in a rut?\nI've had a tag on Delicious that I've used for a long time. I tag things 'inspiration.' That was a huge source for me for a long time to go back to that tag and that master list. Outside of that, it goes again back to physical things. I find a lot of inspiration from physical products—and trying to figure out what has made those successful and work and what's beautiful about them. I remember several years ago reading a retrospective on Oxo and their methodology and just their process in early days of pre-buzzword design thinking and getting down to what really makes something work and makes it beautiful.\nWho outside of your field inspires you the most and why?\nI'm thinking of friends, actually. The first person that came to mind is a friend Daniel Burka , who is a designer and has had a pretty awesome career. He has done a few startups in San Francisco and is now at Google Ventures.

Their original role was to run a price-priority auction based on which ad network was predicted to return the highest value and build the best possible daisy chain in real time.\nThe timing of this adoption on the sell side coincided perfectly with the emergence of bidders. And this was the technological primordial soup that enabled RTB: Bidders could capture large chunks of media spend because the RubiPubMelds of the world had already bundled up the inventory for them. Furthermore, these yield optimizers were eager to accept demand-side platforms (DSPs) into their ecosystem because it justified them being part of the revenue flow and delivering additional demand to publishers, rather than existing merely for operational efficiency.\nAnother component of this is Google, as always. When the yield optimizers were integrating with DSPs and becoming SSPs, Google already had a massive display business with Google Display Network, also known as GDN, the display ad component of AdSense. When AdExchange launched and Google acquired Invite Media, which became Doubleclick Bid Manager (DBM), it went live with only one supply source, GDN. So within less than a year there was effectively limitless inventory for buyers to access due to the existing consolidation of inventory in RubiPubMeld and GDN.\nThis trough of inventory meant DSPs could grow up quickly, and they did. They quickly became specialized to include retargeters, performance marketers, self-serve buying platforms and advanced data management, among others. As real-time bidding became a more critical part of the sell side’s monetization strategy, the tools and controls to support sell side evolved as well.\nFor example, publishers could set floor prices by advertiser or user frequency, view detailed histograms of bidding activity or set up private marketplaces through deal ID to better control who could access specific inventory and at what transparency. The skill set required to manage programmatic selling led to the creation of more technical and senior roles at publishers.\nDespite this renaissance of controls and reporting, the sell side had become largely commoditized. While one SSP might provide a cleaner reporting interface than the next or take less time to set up, ultimately the decision of which one to use would come down to yield. Bake-offs, the running of split user tests with two SSPs to see which performs better, were a common way of choosing a partner, leading some SSPs to “juice” margins to try to remain competitive.\nBidders, on the other hand, don’t necessarily care about which SSP they are buying on either. They care about having access to as much inventory as possible, which makes it hard for an SSP to have any differentiated demand.\nTo prevent being further commoditized, SSPs need to find ways of actually increasing the value of inventory that they make available to buyers – just being the pipes isn’t enough anymore. I believe that the key is in the evolution of the creative.\nInherent Tension\nIn the pursuit of a successful campaign, there are often two forces that play against each other: custom executions and automation.\nCustom executions offer superior creative and generally perform better, but are operationally inefficient. Automation offers tremendous scale but doesn’t necessarily deliver the message in a way that is as impactful. Native support in OpenRTB 2.3 is an attempt to solve for this.\nWhen I say “native,” I am specifically referring to each asset that makes up the creative – including title, description and image – being delivered individually to the SSP, instead of being rendered by a third-party tag. This is what the IAB native spec allows for so when I say “native,” that is what I’m talking about. Whether or not the ad is designed to look like content on the page is irrelevant to this discussion.\nBy this definition, native can support a lot more than just making ads styled to look like they belong alongside publisher content. There is even the potential to deliver rich media experiences where the SSP builds the ad for the right user in the right environment. This will allow brand dollars to flow more easily into the RTB environment.\nThe next evolution of the SSP is rooted in the emergence of support for native ads via standard RTB protocol, enabling automation of custom executions. SSPs now have the ability to optimize the execution of the creative and apply their own expertise on ad formats to add brand new value to transactions. The good news is that we are already seeing many sellers move in this direction. In addition to superior performance, purpose-built ads generally deliver a better user experience as well.\nDSPs will be the ones that need to catch up this time. Yieldmo (I work here), ShareThrough, Triple Lift and other companies are already bundling billions of monthly impressions for programmatic buyers. So just as when RTB first emerged, the inventory for this next wave is already here and DSPs need to participate.\nCatching Up To Facebook\nFacebook already does all of this. It is the buy side and the sell side, and it is attracting larger and larger ad spend because what it is doing works.\nFacebook already allows buyers to provide their creative assets. It also has a massive amount of owned and operated inventory to experiment with the right way to target and build the creative to hit advertiser KPIs.\nThe native RTB spec really just introduces a standardized way to do many of the things that Facebook has been doing, only in an environment that preserves control for both the buyer and the seller.\nWe already know native ads work. We also know RTB works. Now it’s time to bring them together at scale.\nFollow Yieldmo ( @Yieldmo ) and AdExchanger ( @adexchanger ) on Twitter.\n", "deleted" : false }

He will attempt to grow the company’s customer base from its current 143 million accounts while at the same time convincing consumers all over the world that cash is no longer king.\nChudnovsky firmly believes that the future lies in PayPal’s so-called digital wallet technology. That is, using your smart phone to navigate everyday money routines, like paying for groceries and bills and loaning money to friends.\nIt is an opportunity that Chudnovsky likens to the period in history more than 100 years ago when people went from stashing cash in mattresses to entrusting their money to banks.\n“This company has the potential to be one of the biggest in the world. PayPal is a collection of nodes; consumers, merchants and developers. Successfully increasing the transactions between those nodes means that it becomes incredibly effective,” Chudnovsky told VentureBeat.\n“While Facebook is all about your status, PayPal is about money.”\nThe naturalized American is much known within Silicon Valley circles for his prodigious coding prowess and tech vision, which he used to help create an early social networking site, Tickle.com. Chudnovsky and his partners sold that company to Monster for $100 million in 2004. Monster has since disbanded the site.\nChudnovksy’s Oogalabs — a tech incubator and financing vehicle launched in 2007– has spun out some remarkable successes, like social gaming giant WonderHill (sold to Kabam in 2010), Affinity Labs (also sold to Monster),  Jiff , and IronPearl . Ooga Labs was also an early investor in GoodReads, which Amazon bought last year for an undisclosed sum.\nIndeed, Chudnovsky’s vision has made him one of the Valley’s wealthiest serial entrepreneurs — and earned him the respect of some of technology’s brightest minds.\n“Stan grasped the opportunity immediately when he came on board, and he hasn’t looked back,” PayPal chief executive David Marcus told VentureBeat. “His approach to the opportunity for PayPal has been extremely productive in the short nine months he’s been here, making a big difference.”\nChudnovsky’s friends, and there are many of them, are a loyal group. They point to Chudnovsky’s visceral intelligence and his ability to grasp Internet trends before they become mainstream as proof.\n“Stan is not only a brilliant technologist, but he can connect with anybody. His style and approach means lots of people can identify with him,” said longtime friend and entrepreneur Christopher Michel, who sold Affinity Labs and Military.com to Monster for $100 million. “We’re still very early in the days of mobile payments and with Stan, I would bet on PayPal. He’s incredibly committed to doing the right thing.”\nSilicon Valley: Like going to the moon\nThe end of the Cold War in 1989, and the newfound ability of ordinary Russians to travel freely abroad, represented a huge opportunity for the young intellectual with thick, curly hair who had just graduated from Moscow State University with dual degrees in computer engineering and psychology.\n“I grew up during the Cold War as a kid in Russia. Getting to San Francisco and Silicon Valley was kind of like going to the moon. It was a weird idea that San Francisco was the best place to go. When I got out of school in ’94, it was ‘oh, I can actually jump over the pond’ and find a job in the tech industry,” Chudnovsky said recently during an interview at PayPal’s San Jose headquarters.\nDuring his time working up the Valley ladder in the 1990s, Chudnovsky wore a few different hats: coder, consultant, and budding startup founder. He created the first Internet “scraper,” a program that automatically pulled address lists from users’ Hotmail and Yahoo email accounts and allowed the easy transfer of links and information from one user to another.\nIt was Chudnovsky who helped monetize Tickle by creating the site’s successful online tests, where users would answer questions on a host of topics, such as intelligence, health, memory, and family. Chudnovsky realized that people would actually open their wallets, and credit cards, for online survey’s, which made Tickle profitable.\n“We started to make tens of millions in profit by the time we sold Tickle to Monster. We figured out many things at that time, that securing users would give you more users. It was the ‘network effect.’ And online test taking was the way,” Chudnovsky said.\nSaar Gur, a venture capitalist with Charles River Ventures, met Chudnovsky when the Russian coding wonder was at Tickle. Later on, Gur was an early stage investor in Chudnovsky’s social gaming startup, WonderHill, which created the then hugely popular game Dragons of Atlantis. The two became close friends, and Gur said Chudnovsky’s skills at simplifying complicated technology questions, and monetizing them, are legendary.\n“Stan has tactically learned a lot from from the companies he’s been involved with. He’s one of a handful of truly brilliant guys in the Valley,” Gur said.\nFor now, Chudnovsky is focused on convincing consumers that the digital wallet is the future. He still codes to keep his chops up and is a voracious reader of history books. He has two children, lives in Palo Alto, and derives satisfaction from traveling the globe with his family, although he takes a low-key approach to many of the things he does.\nWhen I met him recently, he was dressed in a hoodie and jeans and was sporting a five o’clock shadow. He made it clear that he will continue to innovate and said he’s already made so much money that he doesn’t “have to get out of bed if I don’t want to.”\nWealth interests him, but his passion of extrapolating ways to build better technology and increase users is why he shows up five days at week at his PayPal office.\n“Everything (on the Internet) is about getting rid of the friction,” Chudnovsky said. “That makes it easier bringing people into the network. At Tickle, we laid out the foundation for everything that came later. And I felt great about that.”\n \n", "deleted" : false }

Here Is How To Do it In Tech\nDecember 24, 2015\nI have no idea who Startup L. Jackson is.  He has a Twitter and a Tumblr blog.  Here is his “photo”.\nHe has been rumored to be lots of different people .  He might even be a she.  My guess is that it’s a lot of different people posting on the same account.  Startup L. Jackson gives really good advice.  He isn’t nuanced.  Totally blunt which can be offensive to some people.  I love blunt.  I love transparency.\nYesterday on Tumblr, he posted a blogpost on how to get rich in tech .  Hint, it’s not “startup a company”.  Sure, founders can get rich.  We should admire them.  It’s brutally hard to take an idea and turn it into a sustainable company.  Instead of penalizing, mocking, and marginalizing success and wealth in the US, we ought to be figuring out how to mimic the entrepreneurs that win because we certainly could use more of it.\nA while I go I posted about being a “joiner”.   This is a key point that I knew in my gut but it took Amanda Lannert of Jellyvision to articulate so I understood.   I have since given that piece of advice to plenty of people that want to do a startup. In some cases, it’s as simple as hanging out in the Engineering school at your college campus and meeting as many engineering students as you can.\nThe awesome thing about Startup L Jackson’s post is it gives a systematic approach to finding a tech company that you want to work for.   The post gives you some critical things to think about so you can frame your decision.  There are some gems of advice in there that you find consistently when you speak with successful people.  For example, “Business development is business development.”  Making sure you work with people you like and a business culture you fit with is much more important than the vertical.\nPeople that are good joiners also get rich in tech.  Silicon Valley is littered with people that grew their wealth by joining.  If you have zero technical skills, but you have good selling skills, you can make a very good buck in tech.  The other day a friend and I were talking about early stage companies.  This is a situation we see over and over again.  Startup company has an awesome product.  Startup company has the engineering, design, development chops.  But, no one on the team knows how to sell.  It’s a true art.  You don’t even need a business degree to learn or know how to sell.  As my friend Bob Geras quips, “The best way to increase bottom line revenue is to increase top line revenue.”\nFor entrepreneurial ecosystems to start, there needs to be founders.  But, if they are going to sustain and succeed, joiners are just as important.  In this day and age, you don’t have to go to the Valley to join if you won’t want to.  There are other places to go (like Chicago! : ) ) Don’t be afraid to be a joiner.\nUPDATE\nI should also add that you can make money investing in startups.  But, investing is not accessible to as many people.  Most people are not cut out to be startup investors either.  I have blogged a lot about investing in startups here as have plenty of other people.\n It’s a full time job if you do it correctly.\nYou need the financial capability to make zero money for ten years off of your investments.\nYou need to make at least 20 investments and follow on the good ones to get enough equity to make a difference.\nPlenty of other things to think about on the investment side.  Easiest and most accessible way for anyone is to join a startup that makes it.\n \n", "deleted" : false }

Framesocket is just the latest in a series of platforms that have emerged with affordable pricing plans and easily customizable user interfaces. But while most have been focused on capturing small and medium-sized businesses that don’t have a ton of video expertise, Framesocket is hoping to get interest from third-party developers.\nFramesocket is designed to make it easy for publishers to create video sites and reach a number of devices. The platform allows publishers to build branded video players and archive pages, and has a flexible encoding engine that creates video files which can be viewed across a wide range of devices including as the iPhone, iPad (s aapl) and Android (s goog) mobile phones and tablets. It costs just $25 a month for 5GB of storage and delivery, with additional storage and video delivery available in increments of $0.50 per GB storage and $0.25 per GB transferred.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBut with the launch of other low-cost options like VidCaster and Vimeo Pro , who really needs another online video platform? Developers, that’s who.\nAdvertisement\nFramesocket was built by the guys behind video real estate platform WellcomeMat and location-based photo- and video-tagging service PegShot . The idea behind creating Framesocket was actually to make it easier to develop their own video-based applications, according to CEO Christian Sterner.\nAdvertisement\nBut once it was done and the infrastructure was in place, it made sense for them to open it up to third-party developers . In the same way that 37Signals created Basecamp to handle their own project management needs, then made it available to others, Sterner thinks Framesocket could help those who might want to build apps that leverage video, but without having to create the whole backend from scratch.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSterner says that if such a service had been available when it launched WellcomeMat, or even PegShot, the startup would have been able to save a significant amount of money by outsourcing much of the heavy lifting to someone else. For startups in the fast-paced world of mobile app development, for instance, plugging into a platform like Framesocket could also speed up development.\nAdvertisement\nIn the future, Sterner & Co. plan to do just that: Framesocket will enable the WellcomeMat to easily create white-label video apps for its partners, which include Halstead Properties, Houlihan Lawrence, ForSaleByOwner and Luxury Portfolio.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nTags\n", "deleted" : false }

The latest is Pangalore , a social and mobile game startup based in Seoul.\nPangalore was founded in May to create games that can run on multiple platforms by using HTML5 as their technical foundation. Pangalore built from scratch a game engine that can work within the limits of HTML5, said Doyon Kim, chief product officer and co-founder of the company who runs the office in San Jose, Calif., in an interview.\nPangalore is announcing two new Facebook and mobile games today: Artfit and Wild West Solitaire. Both are slow-moving, cartoon-like titles that accommodate the main weakness of HTML5 now: slow speed. Pangalore is also working on two more titles, Pop the Candy and Bubble Prince, for release later. Kim says the company will release titles every couple of months.\n“The benefit of HTML5 games is that you can start them on one platform and then finish them on another,” Kim said. “We designed our games from the start to be multiplatform games.”\nWhile young, the company has a big staff. It has 25 employees and funding from NHN, the largest online game portal in Korea. The good thing about HTML5 games is they can run on just about any platform, from Facebook to Android phones and tablets. It runs on browsers on mobile devices, PCs, and Macs. Pangalore is also making native format games for the Apple iPhone.\nKim said that deeper strategy and role-playing games are in the works as well, using the Unity 3D game engine. Those games, including a simulation title, will be coming in early 2012. Among the team are some experienced game creators including those who created Ragnarok Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game with 3 million players in North America.\nThe games are free-to-play and are accessible from a single Facebook account that works across all devices. Kim co-founded the firm with Brian Kang, former chief executive of Gravity and a former venture capitalist. Kim previously founded Dialpad Communications, Opinity and Spotplex. Rivals included other HTML5 game makers such as Moblyng and Zynga.\nThe Wild West Solitaire game sets players on a card-playing journey along the historic Oregon Trail, where you race against the clock or friends to play solitaire challenges. Artfit is a falling blocks game where players must place the pieces into forms to score points and advance through increasingly complex levels. Over time, HTML5 is expected to show better performance so that a wider variety of games will be playable on it. Pangalore hopes to be ready when that happens.\nAI. Messaging. Bots.

But while Hulu is now (mostly) unfriendly to startup video aggregators, it’s still sharing its videos with its corporate parents’ friends: the big web portals and MSOs. Put together, the retroactive and inconsistent nature of a recent spate of nastygrams shows the site is feeling insecure.\nOver the weekend, Hulu demanded that a newly launched video discovery startup called Rippol stop embedding all its shows. Hulu told Rippol that it can link to its full library, but not embed the videos. Rippol tells us it will comply, and replace the Hulu embeds where it can from network sites like NBC.com and Fox.com.\nAdvertisement\nRippol competitor Yidio also tells us Hulu commanded it to stop embedding, and video search site CastTV says it has also recently changed to make users click through to watch Hulu. Meanwhile, video guide Clicker declined to comment, but we’ve seen that over the last two months it’s swapped out Hulu embeds for TV network embeds as well.

Users of the storage site will be unable to access their files after August 8th.\nThe company has a long (and extremely confusing) history. In our last post on the site, Charlie Jackson, one of the company’s investors, left a comment explaining the following (we’ve added links to relevant events):\nThe original entity was Streamload. The product name was changed to MediaMax and it was still the same service. Steve Iverson, the founder, was still CEO. Patrick Harr was brought in to be CEO and to help raise money, Iverson was moved to being CTO.\nWhen a C round investor was found, Mission Ventures, this venture firm wanted nothing to do with the consumer service of MediaMax, only wanted to be in the back-end business. The C investor allowed a spin-out to be done, and the new company was allowed to take the name MediaMax and the consumer customers, but no software, no servers, no data. The front-end software was licensed to the spin-out, but for a limited time. Steve Iverson took over this company, while the existing company, with all the servers and data, was re-named Nirvanix. Virtually all the employees stayed with Nirvanix. Nirvanix is trying to compete with Amazon’s S-3 service.\nAround the time this spin-out was happening, Nirvanix engineers screwed up royally and accidentally deleted half the files . Most were recovered over time, but it took months, and there was never 100% recovery (I never got some of files back).\nMediaMax wrote new front-end software and recently changed its name to TheLinkup. Nirvanix wrote new back-end software, but had trouble migrating all the MediaMax files from its old software to its new software.\nMediaMax/TheLinkup coudn’t make all its customers’ files available , ran out of money, and not having a viable business anymore, had to shut down (the C investors never put any money into the spin-out).\nThe company’s latest venture, TheLinkup, was supposed to be a social network centered around storage, but it barely managed to get off the ground. This could be considered a blessing in disguise, as a storage-centric social network would have probably had a difficult time building a substantial userbase, and may have simply resulted in more lost time and money.\nWe’ve added the TheLinkup to the Deadpool .\n", "deleted" : false }

He expects citizen development efforts to expand significantly over the next five years.\nA key reason for this is the accelerating enterprise use of cloud-based software platforms that allow citizen developers to access corporate data more easily than data stored on servers in corporate data centers controlled by the IT department, he says.\nBut here’s the problem. Many citizen developer platforms purport to offer data access and other controls to help ensure regulatory compliance, but Driver says that these are often of limited use.\n\"Compliance controls? Vendors over-hype them and the truth is that citizen developers are essentially ignoring regulatory and compliance issues,\" he says. \"Some platforms do look after that, but there are examples of apps built with citizen developer tools that completely ignore privacy and compliance issues.\"\nBut business users want to use citizen developer tools because they get tired of waiting for IT departments to develop applications they need want to make their jobs more efficient.  That means IT departments have little option but to embrace citizen development while keeping a watchful eye over it, Driver says.\n\"If citizen development is done properly in partnership with the IT department, then that can work,\" he says.  \"There is a distinction between people who develop unbeknownst to IT – we call that shadow IT – and citizen developers who work in partnership with IT.\"\n[Related: 9 bad programming habits we secretly love ]\nSome organizations have already established these sorts of partnerships, but Gartner expects 70 percent of large enterprises will have done so by 2020, up from just 20 percent in 2010.\nThere is good reason to do so, Driver believes:  Gartner expects that 50 percent of companies without formalized control and management of citizen development policies will encounter substantial data, process integrity and security vulnerabilities by 2020.\nFilling in the gaps\nOne company that is heavily invested in citizen development is Mich.-based specialty fulfillment company Helm Incorporated. It uses a cloud-based citizen development platform called Intuit QuickBase.  Michael Wacht, the company’s vice president of operations and a former CIO, says he wants to give business users the capability to develop their own applications to fill the gaps between the applications offered by the IT department.\n\"As we are a service business we have lots of unique needs, and we were so frustrated with the backlog of applications we were waiting for that we decided to let our teams develop them themselves,\" he says. \"It turns out we can develop an application faster than we can document a process.\nHelm's experience is that employees are able to develop useful applications without having any formal programming skills. This is consistent with a recent study of QuickBase users carried out by Intuit which  found that only 8 percent of respondents had traditional coding skills in coding languages like Java, .NET, C++ or Ruby, yet 68 percent considered developing apps to be part of their job.\n\"We find that our staff want to learn to use QuickBase as they want more control in their domain,\" says Wacht. \"Advanced Excel users are the perfect candidates,” he adds.\nAs an example of the type of application being developed, Wacht highlights a merchandising team at the company that sells shirts, stickers and other items with company logos attached.\n \"That team generated about 3,000 spreadsheets over a space of two years, and they would circulate these spreadsheets every day. The first app that was developed was a fairly robust database with 256 fields, and it was very successful as it cut out errors and saved a lot of time.”\nThe company now uses 30 applications built using the platform, and Wacht estimates that 95 percent of staff use at least one every day as a critical part of their jobs. Thousands of spreadsheets have been eliminated, and overall he estimates the company has saved around $250,000 by getting rid of process redundancy.\nAs far as compliance procedures are concerned, Wacht relies on the controls that the QuickBase platform provides, and which are configured by IT department administrators.\nMuch of the data that these user-developed applications require is customer-related, but Wacht is not worried that it is being used in citizen-developed applications.\n“I like to remind people where the data came from,\" he says. \"Before, it was in emails, faxes, phone calls and was not controlled at all. Now it is controlled much more rigorously in the QuickBase applications, and that’s what I say in an audit.\"\nA DIY ethos fuels the hands-on approach\nIn general the types of applications that are suitable for citizen development are ones that make peoples’ jobs easier by automating a process, believes Karen Devine, global marketing and channels leader at Intuit QuickBase.\n[Related: The terrible 10: Programmers’ biggest frustrations ]\nDevine adds that younger workers expect to identify and solve problems themselves. “If the technology means that you don’t need coding skills and is accessible then the people closest to the work are the best people to design the solution to a problem,” she says.\nDevine says that citizen development should be thought of as a natural extension of the trend that has seen business users generating their own documents instead of using a secretary in a typing pool or someone else to create them.\n\"In the past we had a PowerPoint pool, and I would write an outline of a presentation on a piece of paper and someone would turn it into a PowerPoint file. But if I didn’t do it quite right then it would have to go back and be changed. Now it’s much easier: I know what I want and I just do it myself.\"\nAnother way that citizen developer tools can be used, Devine suggests, is to get IT departments to do the majority of the app development work – including ensuring that compliance and security is baked in – by creating “application templates.”\n\"These ‘mostly done’ applications can then be given to business users who then develop the last mile, making minor changes and customizations and taking on responsibility for updates and maintenance,\" she explains.\nBut even if they sanction and supervise citizen developers, the biggest problem for IT departments is the risk that some business users will also turn to shadow IT:  developing other applications behind the IT department's back.\n\"There nothing that a CIO can do to stop this from happening,\" warns Gartner's Driver. \"These users work for different people, and the only person they have in common with the IT department is the CEO.\n\"So all the IT department can do is attempt to educate people in terms of the benefits and the risks, and try to influence the decision to become a citizen developer rather than a shadow one,\" he concludes.\nRELATED TOPICS\n", "deleted" : false }

Follow along here .\nHere’s something that would have sounded absolutely crazy just a few years ago: You can now watch television channels like CNN, ESPN, and HBO with only a smartphone and a wireless internet connection, opening up the possibility of catching highlights of last night’s baseball game on SportsCenter on your morning commute and keeping tabs on the presidential election with Wolf Blitzer while wrapping up lunch. All this without having to fork over $100+ a month to the likes of Time Warner Cable and Comcast for cable.\nThings could hardly be better if you’re a cord cutter, or someone who’s ditched cable for internet-based offerings like Netflix and Hulu. And with services like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue , you have access to a swath of halfway decent channels for as little as $20 per month, and with devices like Roku and Chromecast —not to mention the smartphone you take everywhere—you can binge watch everything from House of Cards to Game of Thrones (and its antecedent Rome) in the comfort of your own home or, say, while waiting for a bus.\nThe question now, of course, is what comes next.\nBeing able to pull up the latest episode of House Hunters on your phone is one thing, but are we ever going to reach the cord cutting ideal of being able to pay for individual channels, a la carte? What role, if any, will free over-the-air television play in the cord cutter’s television diet? Will the slow introduction of 4K video content prompt cable companies to widely implement data caps, effectively slamming down on the “free ride” of unlimited home broadband? And what happens if cable companies, gasp, actually decide to lower prices?\nOne thing’s for sure: The next few years are going to be a time of great experimentation when it comes to television delivery.\n“Here’s the thing: At some point you’re never really going to cut the cord because you need internet,” Scott Olechowski, co-founder and chief product officer at Plex , told Motherboard. According to Olechowski, whose app lets users view on their TV or mobile device videos and photos stored on their computer (think DVD rips and the like), the platonic ideal of cord cutting—saying sayonara to Comcast or Time Warner Cable—may be misguided here in 2016. “The idea of cord cutting used to mean, ‘Man, my cable bill is super high,’ but now it means, ‘I cut my internet and my cable’? Well, you can’t do that!”\nIf you’re Olechowski, whose day-to-day job entails trying to figure out where all this cord cutting stuff is going, the threat caused by broadband data caps isn’t some theoretical, edge case concern. “I’ve got a guy who works for me down in Atlanta [Plex is based in Silicon Valley but some employees work remotely],” he said, “and [Comcast is] starting to implement caps .” This, reasoned Olechowski, means cord cutting could quickly become “much more difficult to justify” compared to just biting the bullet and paying for cable.\n“Generally speaking, I don’t think you can win as a business by fighting your customers,” added MightyTV co-founder and CEO Brian Adams. Adams, whose startup created a mobile app that lets users easily find what’s available to watch across their different streaming services, is also tasked with figuring out where the future of television consumption is going, and in his view the introduction of data caps would merely “create the opportunity for Google Fiber or somebody else to come in” and provide unlimited data.\nIt’s not only small startups like Plex and MightyTV that are worried about the potential for data caps to wreak havoc on all the cord-cutting fun—as well as their business.\n“If the bandwidth provider says, ‘I’m capping everyone except the services that I provide,’ that’s hard,” said Ben Weinberger, chief product officer at Sling TV, the Dish Network-owned streaming service that offers about two dozen channels for $20 per month. “The reality is, if you’re a [streaming video] service, whether it’s Sling TV, Netflix, Hulu, etc., nobody would want their service being put at a competitive disadvantage.” After all, you might think twice about binge watching an entire season of Seinfeld on Hulu if you’re worried about being charged by the gigabyte.\nAs it turns out, however, short of swearing off video entertainment entirely (an unlikely scenario given that the average American ingests nearly three hours of TV per day , according to the Department of Labor) the future of television consumption may look a lot like its past—provided you know where to look.\n“There’s one section of people that don’t really realize that antennas are still a thing,” Chris Brantner, co-founder of cord cutting news website CutCableToday.com , told Motherboard. According to Brantner, who regularly fields questions from readers about cord cutting advice, plenty of people are completely unaware of the fact that, with an inexpensive antenna from somewhere like Amazon or Best Buy, you can pull in everything from The Voice to Sunday NFL football without any involvement from Comcast or Time Warner Cable. Of course, while the big networks like ABC and NBC are broadcast over-the-air in crystal clear HD, there’s still the small matter of having to be present live.\n“To me, the antenna is nice, but having a streaming service that could bring it all in” would be the ideal setup, said Brantner.\nAlready, however, there are devices that get us close to Brantner’s vision.\nDave Zatz, who has covered cord cutting and related topics for the news website ZatzNotFunny.com since 2005, stressed to Motherboard that devices like the Tivo Roamio and Tablo HD are able to record over-the-air broadcasts for later viewing, no different than your cable company’s DVR. Some of the devices can even stream recorded shows to your mobile device—echoing the behavior of now-dead startup Aereo .\nZatz caused something of a stir among cord cutters earlier in April when he reported that Sling TV was developing a set-top box that would be able to accept over-the-air television signals. This, according to Zatz, would enable users to browse their local broadcasts networks like ABC and NBC using the Sling TV interface, putting these channels alongside the likes of ESPN and Food Network in a cable-like user interface. “You’d have one app, one interface, and one guide,” explained Zatz, noting that such a set-top box might be particularly attractive to people who haven’t yet cut the cord.\nAs it turns out, cord cutting is still somewhat on the small side, with the research firm eMarketer noting that, through the end of 2015, a total of 4.9 million US households had cut the cord. Nearly 5 million households is nothing to sneeze at, but it’s a far cry from the 100 million or so US households that still subscribe to cable or satellite. But regardless of what happens to the television landscape, you can bet that the cable companies aren’t going to sit on the sidelines and watch their profits evaporate overnight—even if you’re able to wring a bit more control over what you see, when you see it, and where you see it.\n“I honestly believe we could be heading into a world where everyone thinks they’re cutting the cord, unquote, saving a bunch of money, unquote, and we end up paying actually a lot more for less,” said Plex’s Olechowski, noting how quickly costs can escalate once you start subscribing to multiple streaming video services. “But maybe by becoming our own programmers that’s better.”\n“Netflix is great: $10 a month and no commercials,” he added. “But once you live a life without commercials, going back to cable with ads is a shitshow. I can’t even handle it.”\nTopics: Cord Cutting , television , netflix , hulu , Plex , MightyTV , data caps , net neutrality , Futures , short circuit\nContact the author by email or Twitter .\nYou can reach us at letters@motherboard.tv .

If you're familiar with EventBrite , Eventsbot isn't too far off: just set up your event, set ticket prices, promote it, and Eventsbot takes a small cut of the sales as its fee. The service is aimed mainly at event planners, but if you're looking to host a small event with controlled price ticketing, services like this can be a little more extensive than basic party invite sites, or build-your-own ticket sellers like Zaptix or TS.com .\nEventsbot comes in two flavors, a standard and premium. The standard is free, although you're not getting some of the more advanced features like event page customization, invoices and payments via PayPal , and integration of the invite page into your site's domain. Signing up for the premium service doesn't require a monthly fee or any contracts, instead the service charges a 2 percent fee on every ticket sold.\nIf there's anything to be said about improving the service, I found many of the hosted events didn't look very good. This can be remedied by \"skinning\" them with your site's CSS, but in terms of page layout and readability, I'm more impressed with EventBrite's offerings, as they're slightly easier on the eyes. Considering these pages are a front end for people to pay money and decide whether or not they're coming, first impressions can make a big difference.\nOther event planning services include the aforementioned EventBrite, 123 Signup , Acteva , and RegOnline .\nThis invite isn't much to look at, but if you're an Eventsbot premium member, you can skin an event with your site's CSS.

They are also developing a channel on Ustream.tv to cover local events. The company provides a great package of event management tools including online registration, email marketing (souped-up spam) and online event promotion.\nTheir online event promotion tools include a nifty service called Event Network Listing that can only be described as “AdSense for events.” The service lets event planners for a fee list an event on any site or blog in Eventbee’s growing partner network. The partner network consists of sites and blogs that have AdSense-like code embedded on their sites. This allows for highly targeted and controlled event promotion. You can see Eventbee’s network event listings in action on Rajesh Setty’s LifeBeyondCode .\nEventbee partners get paid in two ways. First, they get an initial listing fee for each new listing that they get to set in advance. Second, when event ticket purchases are initiated from their site they receive a commission. The commission amount is set in advance by the event planner. Eventbee keeps 29% of the total earnings partners make.\nEvent planners can create customizable event pages on Eventbee’s site just like you can with Eventbrite (see our Eventbrite TC20 page here ). Tickets sold from event pages start with fees as low as 1.45% of ticket price, plus a minimum fee of $0.25. RegOnline and Acteva also offer online event registration.\nEventbee’s glorified spam, I mean, email marketing service is tightly integrated with their online registration. You can create beautifully designed emails by importing HTML code or using their WYSIWYG editor.

We originally reported on Trusera’s possible shutdown in March, when the startup was nearly out of money.\nFounded by former Amazon exec Keith Schorsch , Trusera launched almost a year ago. Trusera sought to bring users together who were suffering from similar health conditions. The site also took other personal information into account when connecting people, including a user’s hobbies, location, and age. Trusera would then match people up according to all of these factors and allowed users to receive email updates whenever a new match submitted a story or tip, which meant that users didn’t have to worry about constantly searching the site for new information.\nIn the blog post, Trusera’s site manager wrote that the startup had run out of funds and could not sustain operations. Although the site was innovative and had steadily attracted a growing and dedicated set of users over the past year, it was still a small community. The health 2.0 space is a competitive landscape to survive in—there are a number of websites, including Medpedia and PatientsLikeMe, devoted to online forums for people to share their health-related stories.\nAfter the close, Trusera will keep a landing page with information about the site and its mission but will disable all other functionality. Trusera says that the content of site will be secured so that it can be preserved in the event that the startup is able to raise additional funds in the future.\n", "deleted" : false }

When the former CEO of Groupon left the daily-deals company he co-founded last year, his farewell blog post seemed to satirize the entire genre of corporate goodbyes. \"I’ve decided that I’d like to spend more time with my family,\" he wrote . \"Just kidding — I was fired today. If you’re wondering why… you haven’t been paying attention.\" The once high-flying Groupon had fallen to earth shortly after it went public, and amid lackluster earnings, Mason was ousted. Newly free of responsibilities, he wrote and recorded  Hardly Workin ’, an album of motivational rock songs aimed at cubicle drones. (Praise for the record seemed to top out somewhere around \" competent .\")\nMason’s next act is also something of a surprise. Last year he and Yishai Lerner, the former director of mobile engineering at Groupon, founded  Detour , a company that produces and will ultimately sell high-quality audio tours of cities around the world. Detour is launching in private beta today for iPhone, with four tours available for San Francisco. Mason says he started thinking about audio tours before founding Groupon, during a trip to Rome with his wife. Large guided tours are impersonal and often drag on for hours, he says. After downloading an audio tour to an iPod, he became convinced they were the future of travel.\nOn a sunny afternoon in San Francisco, Mason and I meet up in the North Beach neighborhood to try it out. The lightweight app comprises just a few screens, all designed to get you to your tour. (For beta testers, the tours are all free; eventually they’ll sell for less than $10 apiece, Mason says.) On this day we’re taking the Beat Generation tour, which recounts the adventures of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsburg, and their contemporaries during a walking tour of North Beach and Chinatown. We meet at Vesuvio, and Mason hands me an iPhone with Detour loaded. The app syncs audio between our iPhones so that we’re always hearing the same thing.\nIt sounds like a particularly good episode of This American Life\nFor the next 20 minutes, we hike through the streets of San Francisco learning about the Beats — where they wrote, where they drank, and where they stumbled home afterward. A compass on the app points the way in case we get off track, and with one tap we can see a map of where we're headed. The tour, which is narrated by a radio host and producer named Ninna Gaensler-Debs, is fantastic: punctuated with interviews by living Beats, including Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and set to a lively jazz soundtrack. It sounds like a particularly good episode of This American Life, only Gaensler-Debs is hyper-focused on physical location: she’ll mention that you’re walking by a souvenir shop, or that there are live turtles in the butcher shop just ahead.\nAt one point, she mentions that a shop owner in Chinatown is sometimes outside playing his violin; as soon as we come around the corner, there he is, playing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" \"I walk around and think of places in the world differently than I did when I started this,\" Mason says. \"You know there are beautiful stories and reasons behind everything that you’re seeing, even if you don’t know what they are.\"\nMason being Mason, Detour can also get weird. One of the tours available at launch is a cupcake tour of the tony Marina District narrated by \"philosopher Ulrich Fürst,\" who in reality is a friend of Mason’s doing a dead-on impression of the filmmaker Werner Herzog. \"While you feast on delicious local pastries, Ulrich questions the metanarrative scaffolding that supports your sensorial enjoyment,\" reads the description, which describes the neighborhood as a place \"where capitalism is fueled through the parasitic symbiosis of indulgence and restraint.\" It is insane in the best way.\nUnlike Groupon, Detour is poised for slow growth: producing high-quality audio tours takes time. It’s avoiding tours for museums for now, Mason says, mostly because he doesn’t enjoy museums. For now, Detour will only produce tours for the Bay Area; it’s currently working on an architectural tour and a collaboration with the publishing house McSweeney’s, among other projects. Mason won’t say when the app might launch to the general public, although you can sign up today at Detour.com . An Android app is forthcoming.\nInsane in the best way\nMason isn’t the first with the idea for something like Detour — MyTours and Soundwalk both offer platforms for audio tours. Detour (which collaborated with Soundwalk for one of its tours) hopes to stand out through the quality of its tours; it also plans to offer tools to let you easily build your tours next year. Eventually, the company hopes to host and sell tours from around the world. Mason has invested $3 million of his own money to launch the company; he has a team of seven working on the app.\nDetour has a long road ahead of it, and the company seems unlikely to fetch the $6 billion acquisition offers that Groupon once fielded from Google. But Mason says he’s just happy trying to get people out of the house. \"So many companies seem to have this shared endgame of getting you sitting on your couch in your living room, having your food delivered, having your laundry brought out and sent back, talking to your friends on your Oculus Rift,\" he says. \"Maybe I‘m being a Luddite, but I kind of like life’s rough edges. I want Detour to be a company that helps take people out there and celebrate them.\"\n", "deleted" : false }

With KuberDock, hosters can offer SaaS and PaaS applications to their customers out-of-the-box.\nRust, Germany (PRWEB) March 16, 2016\nCloudLinux, the maker of the leading hosting OS powering more than 20 million websites, today announced the launch of the KuberDock platform that allows hosting providers to deploy dockerized applications and offer them to customers in just two hours. The first of its kind, KuberDock is based on Docker containers, and allows hosters to choose from thousands of available dockerized apps to expand their app portfolio. Hosters can upsell add-on applications, offer popular apps from the list of more than 70K options, or allow customers to choose and deploy any of the dockerized applications.\nWith KuberDock , hosting providers can expand revenues fast:\n1.    Start selling ready-to-use apps available in KuberDock’s catalog of predefined applications, which include applications such as Magento, MongoDB, Redis, SugarCRM.\n2.    Gain access to and sell any of the 70K+ of Docker apps available within Dockerhub, like search, image galleries, or video streaming apps.\n3.    Create their own comprehensive yet easy-to-deploy application packages by combining components to be sold as a single application. For example, Wordpress with elasticsearch, blog software with video streaming apps, or ecommerce software with image galleries.\nKuberDock allows hosting companies to compete with giants like Amazon AWS, Google & Azure offering a wide variety of apps. It also helps them make better use of their infrastructure, as hosting companies now can use Docker container technology to run a lot more apps on the same server, and offer application hosting using Docker format quickly and easily.\n“Customers don’t want to run and maintain virtual machines, but they do want to use applications to help them run their businesses,” said Igor Seletskiy, CloudLinux CEO. “With KuberDock, hosters can offer SaaS and PaaS applications to their customers out-of-the-box. We made deployment easy for hosters, and very simple and user friendly for their customers.”\nKuberDock’s container orchestration framework was built exclusively for service providers and is out-of-the-box platform supporting multi-tenant environments for hosting Docker containers. It takes only a few hours for the hosting provider to setup KuberDock. KuberDock integrates natively with WHMCS and cPanel, and provides billing & control panel integration API for 3rd party billing systems and custom control panels. KuberDock natively integrates with Ceph for persistent storage and provides secure networking to connect multiple containers across nodes for the customer.\nAvailable for hosting providers for trial or purchase now at http://www.cloudlinux.com/kuberdock .\nAbout CloudLinux\nCloudLinux is on a mission to make Linux secure, stable, and profitable.

Sam Gustin Business\nDate of Publication: 01.18.11.\nTime of Publication: 3:46 pm.\n3:46 pm\nA Media Colossus Is Born: Feds Approve Comcast-NBCU Merger\nThey’ll be popping corks tonight in Philly.\nThe world has never seen a media Goliath like the entity that was born Tuesday after the Federal Communications Commission approved the merger of Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, and NBC Universal, the mammoth entertainment giant.\nThe Justice Department also announced that it had signed off on the deal.\nPhiladelphia-based Comcast has achieved what some have referred to as “the holy grail” of the entertainment business: the union of a vast broadband-distribution network with a rich stable of content and talent. The last time any company tried to do something on this scale was the AOL Time Warner deal, which was, shall we say, ahead of its time.\nOver the last year, critics of media consolidation have vigorously protested the deal, saying it would concentrate too much market power in the hands of the new $30 billion entertainment and distribution giant, and lead to higher prices for consumers.\nBut after applying conditions to the deal and extracting voluntary commitments from Comcast, the FCC has concluded that the transaction serves “the public interest,” which is the criterion the deal must meet to gain FCC approval.\n“The conditions include carefully considered steps to ensure that competition drives innovation in the emerging online video marketplace,” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in a statement. “Our approval is also structured to spur broadband adoption among underserved communities; to increase broadband access to schools and libraries; and to increase news coverage, children’s television and Spanish-language programming.”\nThe vote was 4-1 in favor. Michael Copps, a Democratic commissioner, was the lone dissenter.\n“Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal is a transaction like no other that has come before this commission — ever,” Copps said in a statement. “It reaches into virtually every corner of our media and digital landscapes and will affect every citizen in the land. It is new media as well as old; it is news and information as well as sports and entertainment; it is distribution as well as content. And it confers too much power in one company’s hands.”\nBut Christine Varney, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, said, “the conditions imposed will maintain an open and fair marketplace while at the same time allow the innovative aspects of the transaction to go forward.”\nComcast, the nation’s largest cable television company and internet provider, has 23 million cable subscribers and 17 million broadband customers.\nNBC Universal, of course, owns the “peacock network.” It also owns 10 FCC-licensed NBC stations in major cities including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as the popular Spanish-language Telemundo network. And then there are the cable networks: USA, CNBC, MSNBC and Bravo.\nThrow in Universal Pictures and various theme parks, and you’re talking about some serious entertainment assets.\nAmong the commitments Comcast has made are to “increase local news coverage to viewers; expand children’s programming; enhance the diversity of programming available to Spanish-speaking viewers; offer broadband services to low-income Americans at reduced monthly prices; and provide high-speed broadband to schools, libraries and underserved communities, among other public benefits,” according to the FCC press release.\nThere was some controversy over Hulu, the popular free internet video site that is partially owned by NBC Universal. Critics of the deal had warned that Comcast, after acquiring NBC Universal, might use its power to stifle Hulu.\nIn an eyebrow-raising policy maneuver, the FCC has said that Comcast can maintain its newly acquired ownership stake in Hulu, but cannot exercise “managerial control” over Hulu.\nComcast has to make its content available for sale, including content it shows on its online portals such as Fancast, to other cable providers and online video providers at a fair price, according to the order. That limitation is intended to keep Comcast from strangling its competitors with high prices for its content.\nComcast also agreed to abide by the recent net neutrality rules passed by the FCC , which require the company to not block or slow down online video sites. Comcast has voluntarily agreed to follow those rules even if they are struck down by a federal court, which legal experts say is a real possibility.\nFCC officials describe this condition as a binding voluntary agreement.\nComcast will also have to offer customers the option to order internet service, without a cable TV bundle, for seven years. For the next three years, the price will be $50 for 6 Mbps upload speed in all of Comcast’s service areas.\nGoogle TV fans, however, will find no help in getting NBC to stop blocking Google TV from letting people watch videos from its online sites on their televisions.\nFCC officials say that NBC remains free to block Google TV.\nCritics of media consolidation savaged the deal and the FCC’s approval of it.\n“Today’s decision by the FCC represents a failure of the agency to live up to its own public interest mandate, as well as Barack Obama’s promise to promote media diversity and prevent excessive media concentration,” said Josh Silver, President and CEO of Free Press, a D.C. advocacy group. “This deal will give Comcast unprecedented control over both media content and the physical network that delivers it.”\n“The approval of this merger represents yet another failure of the Obama administration to live up to the president’s promises to protect against media consolidation and ensure access to a broad range of diverse sources of news and information,” Silver added. “Apparently, such promises aren’t worth much in the face of Comcast’s army of lobbyists, PR shops and generous campaign contributions. Today, Comcast has won the jackpot, and once again, it is the American people who will end up paying out.”\nAdditional reporting by Ryan Singel.\nFollow us for disruptive tech news: Sam Gustin and Epicenter on Twitter.\n", "deleted" : false }

Both sites have already had relatively enormous scale, by most standards. So it’s worth asking what’s in it for the advertisers?\nIn talks with several online ad observers and agency execs, the first reaction was that this solves a content problem first. If it addresses AOL’s advertising, it’s not that clear.\nAdvertisement\n“AOL has just placed a big bet on the authentic web at scale,” said Greg Shove, founder and CEO of online branding specialist Halogen . “Their challenge now is to create products and programs that translate the huge impressions they’ve acquired into real influence for brands. If they make this just a volume play for advertisers, they lose.”\nAdvertisement\nIn basic terms, this is the combination of a large collection of news sites. Online is always about scale, first and foremost. And while this deal certainly builds significant scale, it’s not clear that it makes for a smarter collection of advertising units that fit seamlessly together.\nAdvertisement\nAs most media execs will acknowledge, most news sites do not typically command high CPMs, compared to sites devoted to health, sports and finance. (It’s also worth noting that AOL recently struck a deal to outsource its sports and health content just as it was talking to HuffPo about an acquisition.)\nAdvertisement\nStill, AOL has been focusing diligently on building up the user experience across its homepage, while pushing its individual properties to start driving traffic independently of its homepage, which is still fueled by its dwindling internet access business. At the same time, AOL has been concentrating on moving more towards premium ads through its Project Devil, super-size display ads program aimed at bringing in lucrative branding dollars, and away from cheaper, remnant ads associated with its large scale Advertising.com network.\nAdvertisement\nThose shifts have been categorized as causing necessary pain to AOL’s revenues, while positioning it for a brighter future. AOL CEO Tim Armstrong has pleaded with investors for the past few quarters for patience, arguing that the company’s display revenue problems will turn around by mid-year.\nAdvertisement\n“Now comes the hard part: actually monetizing all of that content,” said Critical Media ‘s Sean Morgan. “And profitably. Sure HuffPo is good at it, but video is where the problems begin. ?¨?¨If monetization will be through saturating their brands with local video content [per leaked “master plan” on Business Insider last week], we’re looking at a second Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) moment for AOL – the company does not have the infrastructure to efficiently (read: fast and on the cheap) put out news video that will both serve the interest of their readers and make them money. Just read “The AOL Way,” which specifically spells out the ridiculous page view numbers each video on the network requires to gain profitability: 35,000 views for a StudioNow video and a whopping half million views for a “premium” video.?¨”\nAdvertisement\nNaturally, AOL clearly believes it has the plan in place and scale to do it all very efficiently. Again, the big bet is on being able to attract premium ad dollars. And ad agency execs who agreed to speak publicly said that they’re willing to go along with it, at least for the time being.\nAdvertisement\n“The HuffPo acquisition proves that there is a whole new layer of ‘premium content’ that exists in today’s advanced, highly digital, and often socially curated landscape,” said Tim Hanlon, CEO of Mediabrands’ investment arm Velociter. And AOL is angling to be the hub, spoke, and sometimes wheel of a lot of it, especially in what I call ‘relevance verticals.’ The passion of discourse found on HuffPost, the depth and timeliness of Patch’s hyper-local news, vertical blog/curation channels like WalletPop & FanHouse — it’s quite possibly becoming the next-gen scaled media content company.”\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nTags\n", "deleted" : false }

It comes from a company, Brainchild, that has been around in the educational space for two decades. According to Tim Kimbrell, a rep at Brainchild, it actually developed the first portable tutoring device back in 1993. That allows the Kineo to work well with a school's other assessment and instructional software, says Kimbrell, while offering consumer features like curated access to Google Play app store. The use of replacable Li-Ion batteries means that the Kineo can outlast other tablets, too. Brainchild says the Kineo and its predecessors have been used by hundreds of schools and districts over the years , though the company declined to reveal any names to me.\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nThe Intel StudyBook is a 7-inch tablet that uses a power-sipping single-core Intel Atom Z650 chipset and runs either Windows or Android (Honeycomb 3.0) on top. \nThe above photo is from my  ZDNet compatriot Christopher Dawson's blog , who declared the StudyBook \"what an education tablet should be.\" As Monty Python would say, Pretty strong meat from Longueur. \nThe StudyBook will start for  less than $200 , a price point aimed not at besting the iPad but at competing with the One Laptop Per Child project for the hearts and minds of, not parents, but schools, especially those in the Third World.\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nSpeaking of the OLPC, the non-profit is introducing the  XO-3 , an 8-inch Android/Linux based tablet that uses an Armada 610 system-on-chip - essentially an ARM v7 chip running at 800 MHz. No speed demon, but OLPC's hardware never is. Rather, the XO-3's goodies are in the area of power - it can be charged via a hand crank or optional solar panel - and display - the Pixel Qi sunlight-readable screen.\nThe XO-3 will  reportedly cost $100  when it's available (no word on that yet) The OLPC is also working on a convertible tablet/laptop called the XO-4 Touch that may arrive before the XO-3 -  Q1 2013 .\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nThe newish  MEEP tablet  is from Oregon Scientific, which I know best as a maker of fancy thermometers. The Portland company is pitching the MEEP as having all of the kid-friendly touches of the LeapPad and InnoTab (ruggedized plastic case, parental controls, curated MEEP app store) but with grown-up features (Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, 7-inch screen, 1 GHz ARM Cortex A8 CPU, 512 MB RAM, streaming video to TV via HDMI slot).\nReviews of the MEEP are neutral to positive . Parents whose kids have outgrown the kiddie tablets but don't trust them with their family iPad might find the MEEP a good deal, especially if Oregon Scientific can deliver a good, inexpensive app store. But the two tablets I'm really excited about lurk later on this slideshow.\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nAnother $150 tablet aimed at upscaling the child device category dominated by LeapFrog and VTech, the Tabeo is a 7-inch Android 4.0 ICS tablet. Coming from Toys R Us, it has an impressive 4 GB of RAM and built-in Wi-Fi. More impressive is the Tabeo's apps: included for free are Angry Birds Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope, among others, as well as access to a curated app store, which includes 7,000 free apps and thousands available for purchase.\nMost impressive to me is the feature that lets parents set limits on the amount of time their kids can play the device every day or week. That's a feature I would love to have on my iPad.\nOn the other hand, its 1 GHZ single-core ARM chipset and 800x480 screen are unexciting, especially compared to the Fuhi Nabi, which I describe later.\n(Note: Fuhu has sued Toys R Us, its former partner, over the release of the Tabeo.)\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nThe ChildPad is another 7-inch Android 4.0 ICS tablet that predates some of the others by a few months. It was originally marketed by Archos, but now seems to have been taken over by Arnova i nstead. Besides sporting a 1 GHz ARM A8 chip, 1 GB of RAM, 4 GB of storage and a capacitive touchscreen (latest version only), the Child Pad's main merits is its $139 price tag, or $20 less than the MEEP and Tabeo. \nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nThe Kurio comes courtesy of Techno Source, a division of the $20-billion-a-year Hong Kong conglomerate, Li & Fung. It was introduced several months ago, and, like the MEEP, Child Pad and Tabeo, runs Android 4.0 ICS on a 1 GHz single-core ARM processor with 4 GB of storage and 7-inch screen.\nLike the coming Tabeo, the $149 Kurio lets parents control how much time they kids can play, as well as filter out adult content. Reviews of the Kurio are mixed. PC Advisor  lamented the quality of the Kurio's 800-x480 screen, while PC Magazine called it a  Kindle Fire for kids . The Kurio has pretty good reviews at, ironically, Toys R Us. \nComing soon: a 10-inch version of the Kurio.\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nTo be available in the US in mid-September , the Lexibook comes from a French-Hong Kong firm that has been selling its (150 pounds) $237 tablet in Europe for some time. If Engadget is right , the specs sound awfully weak, especially for the price: 600 MHz ARM CPU, 256 MB RAM, 4 GB storage, Android 2.2 Froyo. Might as well fly to India and buy a $21 Aakash-2 . Perhaps the Lexibook's parental controls, user interface and included educational apps and games will make up for that, but I'm not optimistic.\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nFuhu is a Los Angeles-area VC-funded startup that has, on specs and Web marketing alone, the most exciting kid tablet out now. The just-released Nabi 2 is basically a Google Nexus 7, down to its $199 price. The Tegra 3-based hardware spanks most of the other competitors out there. What the Nabi does come with is the obligatory orange rubber case, parental controls, and a bunch of pre-loaded games and educational apps as well as videos and songs which Wired's reviewer (and his 4-year-old son) loved.\nThe consumer reviews of the first version were good ; the reviews of the latest version are better . So I'm eager to get me and my kids' hands on a Nabi 2 and see if it lives up to the hype.\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nTabeo, Kurio, Nabi and now the Kuno : what's with all of the tablets that sound like sushi restaurants?  Seriously, the Kuno 3 is a 10-inch tablet running Ice Cream Sandwich on top of a 1.2 GHz ARM A8 chip, 1 GB RAM, and 16 GB of storage. And it costs about $500 to schools. \nSo what makes the Kuno stand out? Apparently, the CurriculumLoft software from the Indianapolis company of the same name that makes the Kuno. CurriculumLoft helps teachers manage their classrooms, and helps the school's techies manage the Kuno tablets.\nThat combination has helped the Kuno get deployed by a number of districts. Martin Elementary in Illinois is rolling out 1,200 Kunos, while San Felipe Del Rio District in Texas is rolling out 1,600 Kunos. See my Google map of tablet deployments, fall 2012 , to see a number of others.\nI plan to interview the executives of Kuno on Thursday, Sept. 13, so if you have any questions, please tweet them to me at @ericylai or e-mail me at ericyolai@gmail.com. \nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\nThe VINCI Tab II M is a new $169, 5-inch tablet from a company, Rullingnet Corp. that released its first 7-inch version a year ago. The smaller size makes it suitable for toddlers as young as 18 months - indeed, the company is jumping into the market  for training baby geniuses  once dominated by Disney's Baby Einstein DVDs .\nThere are over 500 apps and e-books available to kids. Globally-minded parents will love that the VINCI curriculum apps can be set to work in French, Spanish and Chinese in addition to English. The company is also trying to woo app and content developers by promising a 75% revenue share.\nTechnical specs for the VINCI include Android 2.3, 800x480 screen, 1.2 GHz Cortex A8 processor and 8 GB of storage. So no quad-core Tegra 3 under the hood, like the Google Nexus or Fuhu Nabi.\nPublished: September 11, 2012 -- 23:20 GMT (00:20 BST)\nCaption by: Eric Lai\n1 of 11 NEXT PREV\nGallery: The Ten Hottest Android Tablets For Kids And Education\nThe iPad and iPod Touch have been huge hits with children and schools.

The company noted that its end-to-end solution is used by thousands of merchants, payment processors and payment service providers globally, including Chase Paymentech, PayPal-owned Braintree, New Balance, Spotify and Bodybuilding.com.\n“Online merchants face greater fraud challenges than ever before,” said Brad Wiskirchen, Kount’s CEO. “CVC’s funding and strategic guidance will provide Kount with significant resources to continue investing in our industry-leading fraud prevention solutions and to deliver the tools our customers need to combat fraud every day. We’re excited to partner with CVC in our next stage of growth as we continue to develop the industry’s most effective and efficient online fraud prevention solution.”\nWhat this investment shows, Wiskirchen said, is the opportunity in the space, noting that this investment is “one of the largest, if not the largest, private equity financing of anyone in the fraud control space.” The investment will not only be able to put “more feet on the ground in more markets,” but it will also be able to enhance its products across several verticals at a more rapid pace.\n“There are a number of product enhancements that have been on our roadmap that will be accelerated now. You’ll see a lot of new features or enhancements to our products in 2016 as a direct result of this instead of spread out over the next couple years,” he said.\nWith industry data projecting that the fraud detection and prevention industry will swell from $9 billion to over $21 billion by 2019, it’s clear why companies like CVC Capital are investing in the space. A recent study from Kount, the 2015 Mobile Payments & Fraud Survey , suggests that many organizations are lagging behind compared to mobile fraud growth. In fact, over half (60 percent) of respondents said they were “uncertain if mobile fraud is growing at a faster, slower or equal pace as their overall mobile transaction volume.”\n“The payments fraud and security industry is one that we have been actively targeting for a while, and we identified Kount as the obvious industry leader,” said Jason Glass, managing director at CVC Growth Partners. “Kount’s long track record of success in a rapidly expanding market will become even more critical to merchants and payment processors as mobile and Internet commerce grows.”\n", "deleted" : false }

Take Just One Club Card for example: Visit the site, enter barcode numbers for your reward cards, and get one big card that contains all the info. No more juggling cards! And since Drop.io closed down, I've been fishing for another good way to share huge files: Enter Crate. Finally, something that's maybe more fun than useful: AeroWeather changes your Windows desktop colors to reflect the weather conditions outside. Sound interesting? Read on for links and details.\nCreate a Single Card for All Your Reward Cards\nYou know all those reward, membership, and club cards cluttering up your wallet? What a hassle. Wouldn't it be great if you could magically combine them onto a single, space-saving card?\nYou can: just pay a visit to Just One Club Card . True to its name, this Web service creates a printable double-sided barcode card for up to eight different stores.\nAll you do is enter the barcode number for each of your existing cards, then choose the corresponding store. The site has listings for nearly 200 stores, and if there's one you don't see, you can e-mail the site's creator to get it added. Note that a few stores, like Blockbuster, are left off on purpose, as the barcode is also your account number. As the developer notes, \"best not to be shooting those around the Internet.\" In other words, he takes security seriously.\nWhen you're done, just click Create your card. You'll see the completed product, which you can then print, cut, fold, and stick in your wallet. If you really want to get fancy, laminate it.\nI love helpful sites like this. The only wrinkle is that more and more of my membership cards use magnetic strips instead of barcodes. But those that do have barcodes are headed straight for the trash can (or at least the file drawer).\nQuickly and Easily Share Large Files With Crate\nLooking for a fast, no-fuss way to share big files with friends or family members? Until recently, your best option was Drop.io. Alas, the service shut down earlier this month, having been purchased by Facebook for an as-yet-unknown fate.\nI've yet to find the perfect replacement, but Crate comes close. Like Drop.io, it gives you a dedicated repository for the files you want to share and a unique URL with which to share them. Instead of \"drops,\" you build \"crates.\"\nIt's literally a two-step process. First, you do is drag one or more files to the crate image on the site. Second, when the upload is done, you copy the provided URL and e-mail it to whoever needs the files. Can't get any easier than that.\nYou don't even have to register, but there's incentive for doing so: unregistered crates expire in 30 minutes, but if you have an account, they last indefinitely.\nA free Crate account lets you store up to six crates, each with an individual-file size limit of 50MB and a total space limit of 200MB. A Pro account ($9 monthly) nets you unlimited crates and file sizes, with a storage cap of 2GB.\nThere are lots of other services that offer big-file sharing, but few match the simplicity of Crate.\nTurn Windows Aero Into a Weather Monitor\nDon't you hate having to look outside whenever you want to know the weather? Talk about a hassle!\nFreeware tool AeroWeather puts Windows Aero (the graphical interface introduced with Vista) to practical use, retrieving the temperature or current weather conditions for your location and changing the color accordingly. So, for example, if it's particularly cold outside, AeroWeather will fade your UI to purple. When it gets warmer, look for redder colors.\nPersonally, I prefer the condition-based color changes: white when it's snowing, blue when it's sunny, dark gray during rain, and so on.\nAeroWeather doesn't mess with your wallpaper, fonts, or anything like that--it merely changes Aero's colors. Pretty nifty, don't you think?\nThe program is compatible with Windows Vista and 7, both of which must have Aero enabled. It also requires the .NET Framework 3.5 (which it will install for you if you don't already have it).\nNote: The installer is called Setup.exe, which can be confusing. Learn how to rename Setup files so they're easier to figure out later.\nIf you've got a hassle that needs solving, send it my way. I can't promise a response, but I'll definitely read every e-mail I get--and do my best to address at least some of them in the PCWorld Hassle-Free PC blog . My 411: hasslefree@pcworld.com . You can also sign up to have the Hassle-Free PC newsletter e-mailed to you each week .\nRelated:\n", "deleted" : false }

Other terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.\nTo date, San Francisco-based Flite has raised $27 million in funding from a group of investors that includes Sequoia Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and Northgate Capital.\nThe company’s self-service online advertising platform enables publishers and brands to engage their audiences with “differentiated” ad products. The platform serves, updates, and measures digital advertising campaigns in real-time and integrates Web apps directly into ad units.\nCustomers include Condé Nast (ha), P&G, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, LinkedIn and Forbes.\nFlite was co-founded by CEO Will Price (formerly Managing Director at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, one of the company’s main investors) and Giles Goodwin, who was previously Chief Portal Suite Architect and Director of Engineering at content management company Vignette.\nCondé Nast president Robert A. Sauerberg explained the decision to back Flite to the NYT thusly:\n“We’re going to need a more scalable, more robust set of digital offerings that meet our consumers’ and marketers’ needs. We are actively, at Condé Nast, looking at a variety of targets to accomplish this strategy.”\nIn the United States, Condé Nast currently produces 18 consumer magazines, including Wired , The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Vogue but also 27 websites and more than 50 apps for mobile and tablet devices.\nWe’ll update this post when the official announcement hits the wires.\n", "deleted" : false }

Content was considered more    important than all other key factors including:\nContext – delivering the right message at the right time, 20 percent\nOmni-channel – delivering content across multiple channels and     devices, 17 percent\nEase of purchase – making it easy for consumers to buy, 9 percent\nSpeed – getting experiences to market fast, 5 percent\nWhile the need for rich, engaging content is clearly a priority, 40    percent of respondents feel challenged by a lack of time in creating    those experiences.\nOther challenges included dependency on agencies or third-party IT    companies (23 percent), the need for stronger technical skills and    knowledge (22 percent) and a lack of the right tools or technology (15    percent).\nElsewhere, the survey indicates that nearly a quarter of marketers (24    percent) are taking a month or more to launch online campaigns.\n“In a fiercely competitive sector, it is essential to employ the tools    that allow marketers to easily create and deploy to their website rich    digital, e-commerce-enabled experiences such as lookbooks and product    campaigns,” added Rigney. “Moreover, bringing experiences to market as    quickly as possible has become critical to freeing up time to respond to    market trends and fluctuations in inventory levels or to create    promotions — all absolute success factors as the preparation cycle    begins for the holiday period.”\nMeet up with Zmags at the forthcoming eTail    East (August 10-13), http://zmags.com/blog-lets-meet-at-etail-east.html ;    learn more from the free 2015 State of Digital Marketing on-demand    webinar presentation, http://zmags.com/resources/webinar-the-state-of-digital-marketing-2015.html ;    or download the e-book of the 2015 Digital Marketing Survey report in    full at http://zmags.com/resources/ebook-the-state-of-digital-marketing-2015.html .\nFor more information on Zmags, please visit http://www.zmags.com .

The fashion retailer was named a silver winner    in the “e-commerce innovation” category in the fifth annual awards    program, which recognizes leading retailers that have implemented    successful customer engagement strategies.\nThe annual awards program is held to honor retailers using creativity and innovation to deliver on    the promise of customer-centricity. A total of 18 winners, from national    department store, apparel and electronics chains to highly specialized    fashion, lifestyle and gourmet consumable retailers, were recognized in    the 2015 awards program.\n“As most online retailers know, it can be difficult to quickly and    easily make site merchandising rich and interactive in order to capture    shoppers’ attention,” said Zmags CEO Brian Rigney. “However, through the    use of Creator, Boathouse Stores was able to solve this problem and saw    outstanding results, including increased customer dwell times and    frictionless shopping. We’re thrilled at Boathouse Stores’ success with    Creator and with their Customer Engagement award.”\nBoathouse Stores leveraged the Zmags    Creator platform to easily create and rapidly publish shoppable    lifestyle images, videos and lookbooks to help customers “shop the    look,” rather than searching through the standard product grid. After    deploying these rich experiences, Boathouse Stores increased its    customer dwell time more than six times, from 30-45 seconds to an    average of more than five minutes. With customer engagement metrics    increasing dramatically, customers also turned to social media when they    saw the new site and started to ask, “This is Boathouse?” This clearly    validated that the new technology revamped the brand and increased    customer satisfaction.\n“We’re honored that Retail TouchPoints selected Boathouse Stores as a    winner for our efforts in ecommerce innovation,” said Marc Schwartz,    ecommerce and digital marketing lead, Boathouse Stores. “Our goal has    been to become a more customer-centric brand, and we’ve been able to    make this a reality with the ability to easily create and quickly launch    online merchandising experiences, at the speed needed to quickly and    easily introduce new and seasonal products for customers.

Harbin is a serial entrepreneur who runs the developer and publisher of online strategy and combat games such as Backyard Monsters, Battle Pirates, and War Commander. More recently, Kixeye has been creating new mobile games for hardcore gamers, including a mobile version of Backyard Monsters.\nHarbin seems to enjoy controversy. He has talked about why developers don’t need publishers , why it was right to fire trash-talking employees, and why it’s OK to lob F bombs at rivals in recruiting videos.\nBefore Kixeye, Harbin co-founded Affinity Labs, which was acquired by Monster Worldwide. He also held positions at Netscape, MD Drinks, and Media1st.\nAbove: Rob Weber of NativeX\nImage Credit: NativeX\nAlso joining us is Rob Weber, the co-founder and senior vice president of NativeX, a mobile-advertising platform company based in Minneapolis, Minn. Weber leads business development at NativeX, which promotes “native ads,” or those that monetize better because they are based on content that is native to a game. He is also a private angel investor in a number of music, game, and mobile-app startups.\nBoth Weber and Harbin will talk in a fireside chat entitled, “Data Science: The Newest Weapon in the Arsenal of Mobile Monetization.”\nAs the mobile market continues to grow and mature, the conversation around making money has become something fans hate to hear and developers despise discussing. The industry has changed to the point where the phrase “casual gamer” is being redefined and companies are learning how to cater to consumers accustomed to receiving content for free. Weber and Harbin will discuss how data science is helping companies maximize revenue and where the future of mobile monetization is heading.\nAbove: Monty Kerr, co-founder of Playstudios\nImage Credit: Playstudios\nIn a separate breakout session on social-casino games, Monty Kerr, the co-founder and chief product officer of Playstudios, will also join us at GamesBeat 2014.\nKerr is responsible for product development at Playstudios, which has partnered with MGM to create branded casino games with real-world rewards such as comps in Las Vegas hotels. He is an advocate for blending innovative new business models (such as offering rewards in casino games) with the power of well-known casino brands. Before joining Playstudios, he was responsible for implementing the commerce and ad strategy at early social network Hi5 Networks. He was also the CEO of Big Six Games and was founder of Red 5 Games. He ran Glass Eye Entertainment, Knockabout Games, and Compulsive Entertainment.

We expect to have about 100 speakers.\nEach year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All the World’s a Game” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” focusing on the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored the “Crossover Era” , defined by the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Last year, we talked about the “Battle Royal” as barriers between the different industry segments came down. Now, in the bid for “Total World Domination,” the competition to become the biggest global gaming company is wide open.\nAs game companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, change, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. Billions of dollars are at stake. Last year, more than 550 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, PC, and console — attended the event.

Those ads will also be dynamic, meaning that they can be changed on the fly.\n“If you are a marketer and want to reach gamers at scale, there is no one who can match our scale, our global reach, our tech, and now our real estate in the games themselves,” Dubin said.\nThe Vancouver, Canada-based RapidFire announced in June that it had cut a deal with Miniclip.com to put dynamic in-game ads into web-based games. RapidFire acquired the technology from IGA Worldwide, which tried for years to establish a business with in-game ads for console games. IGA couldn’t make the business work on a large scale, but putting ads inside web games enables Playwire to reach a much larger audience.\nInstead of interrupting a gamer’s experience, dynamic in-game ads can be placed in billboards and posters in a 3D game environment. These ads help add to the simulated realism of a game, and that’s why brand marketers are getting more excited about it, whether it’s in console, social, mobile, or PC platforms. Games that use in-game ads include NBA 2K15, The Golf Club, and Rollercoaster Tycoon.\n“This is a critical piece to our business,” said Dubin. “Now that we are capable to serve ads during game play in real-time, we are able to deliver advertisers one conduit for all of their in-game marketing needs.”\nPlaywire Media says it has become the largest digital content ad exchange in entertainment and games. It reaches 83 million unique visitors a month in the U.S. And the company has expanded into music, sports, film, and other sectors of entertainment such as comedy. Worldwide, Playwire Media reaches 311 million monthly unique users. Now it can place still ads inside games, and in some cases, video ads in some games.\nDuring August, the company said it served one billion ads worldwide on mobile alone. It has had 340 million video mobile ad views since it started doing that in December 2013. More than 4,000 developers have joined the Playwire Media ad exchange.\nMobile game developer?\nLearn how the most successful games make more money with fewer ads.\nDubin founded Intergi in 2007 as a web ad network with a focus on video games. In 2011, it started Playwire Media to focus on video ads. Playwire Media created a customizable and scalable video player that enables publishers and content creators to monetize and syndicate their video content at no cost. Playwire Media encodes and hosts the content so that the customers don’t have to do that themselves. It provides analytics and matches publishers with brand advertisers via a direct sales team.\nRivals include YouTube, Vevo, Brightcove, and Ooyala.\nPrior to the partnership with RapidFire, Playwire Media’s in-game offering was limited to placing preroll ads before, during and after game play sessions on casual games, mobile games, PC digital distribution network Steam, and during livestreaming via the PlayStation 4.\n“The global video game industry is growing at staggering rates,” said RapidFire CEO Jordan L. Howard in a statement. “Our partnership unites two powerhouses in gaming, and we are thrilled that a global force like Playwire Media can help us achieve the scalability and sales resources necessary to help us keep up with such an evolving industry.”\n“The RapidFire partnership allows us to offer advertisers one conduit for all of their in-game advertising strategies,” said Dubin. “We now have the ability to fully integrate any brand’s messaging into every facet of any gaming experience.”\nAbove: In-game ad for Paramount Australia Bad Grandpa film.\nImage Credit: Playwire/RapidFire\n", "deleted" : false }

Much of the revenue in social and mobile games is moving toward the free-to-play business model, where users play for free and pay real money for virtual goods. About 95 percent of Zynga’s revenue is based on virtual goods.\nThe in-game ad companies insert advertisements into games at appropriate points, such as when a round of game play ends. NeoEdge can add a 30-second video ad to an online game to help publishers make money from free games. On Saturday, we broke the news that in-game ad firm IGA Worldwide laid off seven of its 22 employees.\nNeoEdge raised a round of $3 million a year ago, but there was also a messy fight between company executives and one of the company’s investors, VanEdge Capital, headed by former Electronic Arts executives Paul Lee and Glenn Entis.\nDouble Fusion has also added a New York sales office and added distribution in Canada. NeoEdge and its partners add over 100 million monthly video impressions in numerous casual and social games to Double Fusion, which has a global network of 3 billion monthly impressions in games from publishers such as Ubisoft, THQ, and 2K Sports.\n“This acquisition highlights our commitment to deliver a complete 360 degree in-game advertising solution for our clients and partners,” said Dan Chambers, Double Fusion’s head of sales, in a statement. “Gaming has become much more than the entertainment of choice for males 18-34.”\nNow, with the rise of social and casual gaming, ads aimed at gamers can target women as well as young people of both sexes. Market researcher Gartner says that spending on games will exceed $74 billion this year, up 10.4 percent from 2010. By 2015, spending will reach $112 billion, with online gaming rising from $11.9 billion this year to $28.3 billion in 2015. Leveraging that growth, in-game advertising as an industry is positioning itself as a must-have for media buyers, in direct competition with ads on radio, print, or TV.\nDouble Fusion’s ad partners include McDonald’s, Twentieth Century Fox, Dr. Pepper, State Farm and Toyota.\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

It is one great step forward for Boston.\nNot that Boston has ever had any real reason to feel second-rate when it comes to technology. Some of the world’s most successful tech entrepreneurs, including notables Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, got their start as students in the Boston area.\nWe’ve got fantastic universities, unbelievable engineering talent, terrific sales talent and incredible marketing and customer service talent. Boston should significantly outperform other geographies pound-for-pound.\nNew hub for tech innovation\nUnfortunately, for the last generation the reality is that Boston has not realized its huge potential for tech startups — at least in the software and Internet sectors.\nIt’s telling that Gates, Zuckerberg and other founders have felt more comfortable moving away and building their companies elsewhere.\nEven recently, after promoting the Seaport District as a hub for innovation, the Boston startup ecosystem still hasn’t managed to rise at the same pace of some of the other hubs. Silicon Valley, Seattle and New York are absolutely exploding these days, and Austin and Salt Lake City are growing strong, as well.\nYes, there are great startups in this neighborhood. (My own firm, OpenView, has had our office in Seaport for nine years). And in the greater Boston area, there are some standout tech success stories, including EMC , PTC , Akamai , Nuance , HubSpot , Netezza , Endeca , Wayfair , Demandware , TripAdvisor and many others.\nBut for all the efforts of the mayor’s office and the startup community, and despite all the great things going on, Boston, in my view, is still not performing even close to its (superior) potential.\nGE’s move here will make a difference, because it puts the headquarters of a major American manufacturer — one that has embraced the role of software and big data — in the heart of our city. But GE alone is not enough.\nBoston will regain its former glory as a go-to tech center.\nThe big issue is that, while there have been some great and successful companies, Boston largely missed a market shift toward consumer technologies, the cloud and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) in the 2000-2010 timeframe. As a result, our ecosystem has fallen behind a bit.\nIn time, Boston will regain its former glory as a go-to tech center. But Boston can reach even higher, and get there faster, if it addresses the four factors outlined here.\nEarly-stage funding\nOne of the weakest gaps in Boston’s tech ecosystem is funding for the earliest-stage startups. Boston missed its opportunity to own the big shift that happened between 2000 and 2010, from minicomputers and network equipment to consumer technology and the cloud. Many of the great early-stage VC firms in Boston then downsized, shut down, moved to Silicon Valley or evolved into growth-stage firms, leaving a real gap in early-stage funding.\nMy firm funds companies at a later stage of development, the expansion stage. We spend most of our time outside Boston only because by the time companies get to the stage where we’re ready to consider them, they have moved away — or they never got started here in the first place.\nWhen somebody with a great idea gets started and wants to raise early-stage capital, the issue is that there isn’t the same early-stage capital in Boston as there is in New York, Seattle and Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurs may start in Boston, but when they start seeking capital, they’re still fairly mobile. So entrepreneurs are typically going to end up where their capital sources are.\nMore sources of capital, more companies.\nAn even higher aspiration would be to get companies to move to Boston because the VC funding and ecosystem is in Boston. I have influenced the move of several companies to the Boston area over time as an expansion-stage VC, including Acronis and Intronis , and it should be even easier at the earlier stage.\nThe more sources of high-risk early-stage capital there are in Boston, the more companies will get started in Boston. Yes, it is that simple.\nThere are signs that early-stage funding sources are increasing. There are still some great older firms in Boston like Sigma, Matrix , Charles River and Atlas . There are some newer firms that have succeeded for over a decade, like Spark , General Catalyst and Flybridge . And, perhaps most importantly, we’re seeing some great newer early‑stage firms like Hyperplane Venture Capital ,  NextView Ventures , Founder Collective , Assemble.VC and others that have not yet become public. Techstars is also here, and that provides a gathering place, training and some funding for startups that are just getting off the ground. But we need more to reach our potential.\nMore sources of capital, more companies.\nAttitude\nSeveral decades ago, Boston was a hotbed of innovation for then-cutting-edge technologies, like minicomputers, storage and network equipment. Lately, it’s developed strengths in Software as a Service and marketing technologies. So there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with Boston’s innovation culture.\nBut there is still an important difference. In Silicon Valley, the entrepreneur’s default attitude is “Why not try?” It’s an attitude that just assumes huge, world-changing inventions are possible. And if you fail, well, better luck next time — it’s all part of the learning experience.\nIn the northeast, the default culture is a bit more critical. The attitude is more aligned toward “Why try?” or “How about we try something [smaller] that we know we can do?” (Note: This attitude also helped to kill Boston’s Olympic bid before its backers had the chance to overcome the critics.)\nI think we could do a lot to foster an attitude that’s more open to taking risk, less critical and more accepting of “failure” when it does happen.\nExperience\nFor a robust tech startup ecosystem to develop, you need experienced people advising young companies and working for them. You need the larger companies to give the new companies’ products a try. You need entrepreneurs who created companies, experienced managers who helped build companies and executives of larger companies to embrace the young companies and help them get through their fragile early years. Boston lost a generation of this experience when we weren’t heavily investing in the new technologies of 2000-2010, and it will take a while to rebuild it.\nAs entrepreneurs find success here, they should stick around and start reinvesting in the area.\nAs the early-stage VC scene matures, a fundamental paradigm shift will happen after a series of these startups have successful exits. This is a core competency that Silicon Valley continues to build upon. Austin, Seattle, Los Angeles, Denver and a host of other emerging tech hubs are starting to follow this pattern, as well, as more and more entrepreneurs in these areas go public or get acquired. Boston needs to do the same: As entrepreneurs find success here, they should stick around and start reinvesting in the area.\nIn the long term, this will fix itself as we get more early-stage companies going. As they develop, experienced people will leave to start new companies or help other companies.\nBut in the short term, we need the current generation of experienced people and companies to do as much as they can to assist the startup community.\nBig mouths\nThe final part of the issue is that Boston needs bigger mouths. Think Muhammad Ali, Alan Dershowitz, Donald Trump or practically anyone in Silicon Valley. These people are not shy about their great successes, and they all benefited from speaking up.\nRelated Articles\nBoston's WTF/LOL Problem New Boston Program For A Startup Factory Links Seasoned Entrepreneurs With New Recruits\nBoston needs to move away from being understated and cerebral, toward loudly and proudly proclaiming its benefits versus all other geographies. Even Bernie Sanders has figured out how to speak up and loudly communicate his ideas and differentiation in a very successful way.\nIf Bernie can do it and a Harvard Law School Professor (Alan Dershowitz) can do it, I think Boston can do it. Boston’s understated communication style just isn’t working when pitted against New York and Silicon Valley. It is a bit like watching Bush versus Trump, or O’Malley versus Sanders. Speak up with a big mouth, Boston!\nPay attention — Boston is on the cusp of something. With time, Boston will get better and better. If we can execute on the four points above, the Boston tech party revolution will really take off, and will be one to watch for many years to come.\nFeatured Image: Katie Haugland / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Several of the other top competitors in the sector, including Spotify, Imeem, and iLike have begun gravitating towards other revenue sources.\n\"Qtrax is an absolute disaster,\" said one music industry executive who asked to remain anonymous. \"It's an embarrassment.\"\nWhat's noteworthy about the most recent Qtrax setback is that typically Allan Klepfisz, the company's founder, will do damage control with the media. This time, however, a music-sector heavyweight is out in front.\n\"It's a difficult environment to get capital in this industry,\" Jay Berman, a Qtrax adviser and former chairman of the Recording Industry Association of America told The Financial Times this week. Referring to Qtrax's claim that the company hopes to raise $50 million and Qtrax said last week that it has a deal with Baidu, one of China's top search engines, Berman said: \"Is it ambitious? Yes, it is. Is it doable? Yes.\"\nKlepfisz declined to comment. Berman could not be reached for comment.\nBerman was once the recording industry's top lobbyist and according to my music source he used his clout to help Qtrax secure licensing deals with the top labels. A year ago, New York-based Qtrax announced that Berman, who has offered consulting services to several digital music companies including Project Playlist , was added to the Qtrax advisory board.\n\"Every time something happens with Qtrax, Jay has to get on the phone and calm everybody (at the labels) down,\" said the music exec.\nBut the source said Qtrax, at this point anyway, is in no danger of losing its access to the labels' music. He said it has paid and the labels will most certainly accept Qtrax's money. \"Why wouldn't they?\" he asked. \"But they haven't exactly created a lot of good will in the business or enthusiasm for their product.\n\"Qtrax hasn't instilled a sense of confidence that they can actually make something of what they have,\" the exec continued. \"The only reason the (recording) companies have given content to them is because of Jay. If Jay didn't get on the phone, Qtrax wouldn't have its deals.\"\nWhat the exec is referring to, specifically, are things like Qtrax's history of failing to pay vendors. Oracle filed suit against the company earlier this year and several companies have won judgments in New York courts against Qtrax. The latest came two weeks ago when Monarch Capital Fund won an award of $133,000 against the company.\nAccording to court documents, Qtrax agreed in March to pay off a $200,000 debt in installments. Monarch told the court that after paying $70,000, Qtrax stopped making payments in May.\nClarification: Earlier reports by a number of other publications indicated that Qtrax's deal with Baidu wasn't completed. Qtrax does indeed have a signed agreement with the Chinese search engine, Qtrax said Wednesday afternoon.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

Do we need this? CornerWorld thinks it will be able to lure people from its established 30,000-strong CornerBand community--where musicians can put a price on their songs--plus others to use its platform to monetize individual photos, songs, videos that one would normally put on Facebook or MySpace or YouTube for free.\nOne thing CornerWorld has going for it is it offers pretty strict privacy controls. Whereas Facebook members can control who sees individual photo albums or elements of their profile, CornerWorld allows individual photos within an album to be set to private or available for public consumption.\nThere are a whole lot of features going on here, including live broadcasting a la Ustream, plus an events feature (seeVite), which is not as pretty as Evite or as smooth as Facebook's. But if you have cat videos or ringtones or photos you want to sell, CornerWorld gives users the tools to sell their stuff all in one place.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

Each video generally garners between 50,000 and 100,000 views over its lifetime – a not insignificant number keeping in mind the size of the audience, which only comprises roughly 10% of the US population , according to Gallup.\n“When you think of the average print circulation, it could be around 200,000,” Thompson said. “So, 100,000 [people] watching a two- to four-minute video exceeds our expectations.”\nBranded content is now a component of nearly every proposal that Q.Digital submits when it’s pitching for business, said Gatz.\nProgrammatic is also on Q’s radar, but the majority of its business is direct sold. It does, however, run private marketplace deals through AdX, Rubicon and others if that’s what the advertiser wants to do.\n“A lot of the custom things we do for advertisers we can’t do programmatically, but obviously we want to be everywhere our advertisers are, and if they want to buy programmatic as part of their campaign, then we help them do it,” Gatz said. “Our favorite clients, though, are the ones who recognize that we’re the ones who really know how to talk to our audience.”\nIt’s an audience brands want to reach. The combined buying power of the adult LGBT population in the US alone is estimated at roughly $884 billion a year – globally, that number is $3.7 trillion .\nBrand loyalty is also extremely high within the LGBT community, with 70% willing to pay more for products produced by companies that support diversity and equal treatment, according to research conducted by Community Marketing Inc. and Harris Interactive.\n“It’s long been known that this is a lucrative audience and it’s an audience I believe is largely untapped,” Gatz said. “But the issue is less about the audience and more about the advertisers themselves. In each category, there are probably only one or two advertisers really trying to talk to this audience in a genuine way.”\nOne such advertiser is  Stoli . The vodka brand first started using GayCities as a paid media outlet for display in the summer of 2013, just before gay rights activists starting boycotting Stoli in reaction to Russia’s anti-gay legislation. Q.Digital stuck with Stoli throughout the boycott controversy and the relationship quickly deepened.\nAt the time of the boycott, Stoli had already been working to support the LGBT community for several years, including with the appointment of a full-time San Francisco-based LGBT national brand ambassador in 2012. With Q.Digital, Stoli worked to reaffirm its bona fides.\nAlthough Stoli’s main target is millennial men, LGBT consumers are a close second. It’s a challenging target to reach.\n“When you’re dealing with a smaller target, a specialized target, it’s valuable to work with someone that’s an expert in that particular community,” said Lori Tieszen, CMO and SVP of marketing at Stoli Group USA. “Q.Digital plays a very consultative role for us. We think of them more as a marketing partner than just a media outlet.”\nRight before the Stoli hit the fan in 2013, Q.Digital began producing a custom event for the brand hosted on GayCities called “Stoli Guy,” a competition in 12 US cities to find a national spokesmodel for Stoli. Q.Digital leveraged its audience across its various properties and produced custom content to raise awareness and bolster attendance. A dedicated “Stoli Guy” microsite garnered 130,000 uniques.\nLive events are valuable, but digital is one of the most effective ways to connect with this audience at scale, said Thompson. The LGBT community engages with mainstream media – TV, radio, print – but it isn’t necessarily the best way to reach them from a targeting perspective.\n“The LGBT segment is restricted in terms of media options,” Thomson said. “[And] broadcast is only relevant when you’re spending.\"\n", "deleted" : false }

Javier Soltero, Acompli\nWhy Technology ‘Plumbers’ Are Turning to ‘Interior Design’\nImage: Just Jefa/Flickr\nI’m a plumber, and have been for most of my career. While I don’t work with wrenches, pipes or PVC saws, I’ve spent the last 15 years building IT infrastructure and management tools for enterprise software companies. Recent plumbing projects include helping to design and build the backend system for Hyperic, a web infrastructure management tool that was eventually acquired by VMware, where I then led application services strategy for three years as a CTO. Whatever the company, I went to work every day, rolled up my sleeves and went under the sink of big backend business systems, replacing old pipes, fixing leaks and installing new lines.\nSo, after spending most of my professional life in the muck of the plumbing of the internet, why did I next choose to build an iPhone app, something one might easily deem the “interior design” of the software world? The answer is that how we all work is changing, and that’s having a tremendous impact on today’s IT department, the main buyer of plumbing equipment. Unprecedented device adoption, the consumerization of IT and the rise of the the cloud are pushing companies to adapt or fall behind. You and I now have the ability to work differently, and increasingly choose our own technology to get that work done. Not only has that changed the landscape, but also how a plumber like me can best help all of us as professionals.\nThe Commoditization of Traditional IT\nJust ten years ago, there was no way that Box or Dropbox could even exist, let alone be two of the hottest tech companies around, each valued in the billions. This isn’t due to any technical limitations — cloud computing existed then, though definitely not at today’s scale — but simply because storage was the exclusive domain of the IT department. A company’s valuable information was stored on a secure box inside its own walls, and the architecture was created and maintained by that company’s IT department: shared Z: drives, SharePoint… you get the picture.\nThings are different today. Take a quick tour of the Box, Dropbox and Google Enterprise websites and you’ll find each adorned with big-name customers, all storing their important, sensitive documents in the cloud. The same thing is happening with other services like email, security and analytics — products like Google Apps, Microsoft Exchange 365, CipherCloud and Tableau have radically reorganized how companies think about their technology infrastructure, and along with that, what IT departments see as their purview.\nAs infrastructure becomes increasingly commoditized, IT departments have transitioned from laying and fixing pipes to helping control the flow of water through them. Control of, and access to, key elements of infrastructure continues to shift to end users. Innovation in this area is abundant, but there’s only so many things IT can handle. I can assure you that no IT manager has ever uttered, “Please give me more platforms to work with!” As a result, users have begun seeking out their own technology solutions, and bringing those into the workplace.\nMake It Beautiful, or Let Somebody Else Do It\nAccompanying this phenomenon is the changing nature of the products we all use every day at work. Clunky old server-based installations are being overtaken by web-based or mobile applications with friendly and intuitive user interfaces, something that has helped accelerate the commoditization of IT. More importantly, adoption of products is now being led by users explicitly choosing products they want to use, as opposed to IT making those choices on their behalf.\nUntil now, the trajectory of traditional IT has been fairly linear – build, install and upgrade as needed for as long as possible, then reluctantly rip, replace and start over only when absolutely necessary. Too often, IT has been forced to radically adapt due to massive platform shifts like mobile, or by users simply ‘voting with their feet’ and blaming IT for lost productivity. But the increasing consumerization of IT tools and services has opened up a parallel track that enables end users to lead innovation from outside the IT department. In other words, ten years ago, all the average employee could do to fix their company’s storage situation was to complain about how complicated and clunky their Microsoft SharePoint Server was. Those complaints would go ignored. Now the end user has the option to quickly open a Dropbox or Box account to begin sharing files with colleagues. No plumbing required.\nThat’s the big opportunity for former plumbers like me, who have moved on to interior design. We understand the IT department’s real needs, and how to get the mechanical parts of the system working correctly underneath the house. At the same time, we know that the average person just wants to turn on a faucet and have clean drinking water flow freely. By adding beautifully designed faucets to the mix, while not forgetting that important safety valves must be included in case of earthquakes, an “evolved plumber” can help both IT departs and end users alike.\nModern IT departments don’t need more infrastructure, they need better ways to help their end users easily consume information. They don’t need another platform to build on, they need new, innovative – and secure – ways that better empower end users to move information around their organization. Because end user demands are changing, IT is changing. And now, even some plumbers like me are changing too.\nJavier Soltero is CEO of  Acompli .\nOriginally posted by:\n", "deleted" : false }

At close to 1 million offerings, Apple's App Store is full of great inventory, but with most of it hidden in the store's setup, developers and consumers are missing out.\nOttoCat is an automatic categorization system looking to reinvent the way we search and find apps. The new service uses a language analysis system to categorize the entire App Store. A patented computational linguistics and information retrieval system organizes the entire store, making finding apps as easy as browsing the aisles of a well-organized supermarket.\nSEE ALSO: These Are Apple's Top Apps of All Time\n\"What we do is look at all of the text in the apps and find common groupings in all of those apps,\" explains OttoCat's founder and CEO Edwin Cooper . He says the problem with the store is there are whole categories we don't even know exist. \"It's very hard to know what's there. Because an app is visible, it's popular. Because an app is popular, it's visible.\"\nThere are 23 top categories in the store (and rumors of the addition of a new category for kids), with subcategories for games and newsstand. Twenty-three categories for almost 1 million apps means most get buried. Existing categorization services are only able to search a fraction of the store because tools limit users to the keywords they choose; and if an app has never been downloaded or reviewed, it's unlikely to come up unless the exact title is queried.\n\"A lot of people haven't really known what's been in the App Store until now,\" Cooper says. \"All these great developers who made these great apps really need to be recognized for what they've done.\"\nCooper says his research has found that if you combine all of the top 100 apps from every Apple category, you still have less than 0.5% of the entire store. Those that don't make the top 100 lists for most categories or have any ratings to be reported are lost. Cooper says 30% don't have any ratings to be reported; 70% have 10 or few ratings. Meanwhile, apps in the top 100 list can have literally millions of ratings. Because of this system, the change in the top 100 list from January through April is about 2%, he says.\nOttoCat has created 500,000 subcategories, breaking up categories like entertainment into divisions based on data such as cinema, music, comedy, etc. On average, an app is cross-referenced in about 10 categories.\nRight now OttoCat is just web based but built to work well on a tablet or smartphone, Cooper says. An app is on the way.\nCooper learned search as a founder of InQuira, an enterprise search tool employed by Fortune 100 companies like Bank of America. Oracle bought the company in 2011, and Cooper left to spend a year developing the technology system that would become OttoCat.\nHis new Berkely, Calif.-based company makes money through an Apple affiliate program; OttoCat makes 5% off the purchase price of any app bought through the site.\nThis opening of the floodgates has developers excited.\nOsurv , the mobile research app, surveyed 93 mobile developers in the Southern California area, all with apps in the store. When queried if the App Store is disorganized, on a scale of one to 10, one being unorganized, 10 being very disorganized, the average reported score was 8.1. When asked if they would use a new service to find new apps, 91% answered yes.\nGreg Cohn, the co-founder of Ad Hoc Labs, a Los Angeles developer known for the disposable phone number  Burner App , says he's not sure OttoCat will catch on. But, he is open to new and improved ways to search.\n\"It's obviously a good thing for consumers and ultimately the developers who depend on consumer downloads,\" he says. \"I think it's a bit early, however, to say whether a third-party provider can really get traction in this space.\"\nAre you a developer or app user frustrated with the App Store? Would you use this service? Let us know in the comments below.\nJosh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n", "deleted" : false }

In that vein, Loud3r , a company that had to reboot earlier this year after some early missteps, has now raised a “multi-million” dollar round from a non-traditional investor: the New York Daily News, owned by Mort Zuckerman, we have learned and confirmed. In return, NYDN has taken a “major” stake in the company, the source says, though not majority.\nAdvertisement\nLoud3r, which launched mid last year, was founded by Lowell Goss, former SVP at iFilm/*MTV Networks*, and has Mika Salmi, former head of Viacom’s digital efforts, as an advisor. Earlier this year the Pasadena, CA-based company raised less than $1 million, with investment from domain name media firm NameMedia, which has also been using Loud3r’s technology on its large network of sites.\nAdvertisement\nAs the cheap and evergreen content production sector heats up, with companies like Demand Media, Associated, and even *AOL* (through Sphere) and Hearst (through LMK) jumping into the game, a company like Loud3r, which initially focused on creating its own news destinations, is now banking on providing its aggregation tech to publishers. With this in mind, likely NYDN will roll out its own verticals on its recently redesigned website . Loud3r is competing on the tech side with lots of aggregation service companies like OneSpot (which we use for a module on our sites), OutBrain, AggregateKnowledge, Inform.com, Daylife (though each have different spins) and Hearst’s LMK has said it may offer the technology to other publishers down the line.\nAdvertisement\nWill an investment such as this lead to other news orgs looking at buying or taking stakes in such services? Interestingly we’ll have a superpanel on the topic of these low cost content creators and superdistributors at our upcoming paidContent2010 conference in NYC, where we plan to have top execs from the companies mentioned above discuss the genesis of the industry, tech, revenue models, and the future.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nTags\n", "deleted" : false }

The company’s standard practice is that it returns part of its revenues from sales performed through CPA advertising on its site. We reported on $5 million in funding for the company late last month. Now they have launched a feature they call the Jellyfish Smack of the Day.\nHere’s how it works: an undisclosed quantity of a particular item (today it’s an 80 gigabyte Video iPod ) will be put up for auction, starting at its regular price and falling in price every few seconds. Users watch the price fall, torn between letting it fall lower and buying the item at the current price before the mystery quantity is sold out. There’s a forum for real time communication and the psychology sounds just nuts.\nOn the first day the event was held, 10 people got Apple 2GB iPod Nanos for free. On Friday 50 SD-P1700 Portable DVD Players were sold in the Smack, some for as low at $60. Thursday’s PowerShot SD450 Digital Camera never fell below $100.\nAffiliate revenue sharing, real time chat, crowd shopping – sounds pretty 2.0, doesn’t it? Or perhaps it just sounds like fun. As I post this, the iPods are at $310 , the forum is hopping and no one knows how many are left.\nThe company plans on holding the Daily Smack reverse auctions every Monday through Friday. If you find yourself in psychological shambles by the end of the week, here’s a link to the National Council on Problem Gambling . I’ll see you at Jellyfish though.\nUpdate: It looks like the iPods sold out for right about $200, down from a starting price of $350. The forum was quite active towards the end, sociology and psychology students would have had a great time. See also Woot , a site that sells a single item for a low price every day (and was repeatedly derided in the Jellyfish Smack forum) and ZeeDive , a site with a different model we reviewed here.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Since its inception in 2010, EAT Club has scaled its service in the Bay Area, delivering more than three million meals to allow thousands of companies like Netflix , Tesla and Cisco to find their workplace zen.\nHere’s how EAT Club works:\nCompanies select the program that works for them. Office managers pick the exact number of lunches and/or snacks, delivery timing and more to ensure their office always receives the perfect lunch.\nEmployees hand-pick exactly the meal they want from top local restaurants, as well as EAT Club’s own professional kitchens, using the company’s easy online or mobile ordering system.\nPersonalized food options arrive for employees, with proven on-time deliveries more than 99 percent of the time.\nEAT Club has already gained mass popularity in San Francisco through offerings from top Bay Area restaurants such as Dosa , voted 7×7’s Best Indian Food , the famed Bar Tartine and popular food truck Curry Up Now . Now, L.A. companies have the chance to experience this innovative e-commerce food service by experiencing personalized food options at scale.\nOffering a curated, ever-changing menu, EAT Club leverages professional chefs and food designers, local restaurants and a massive logistics platform to ensure timely, consistent deliveries. The service makes it easy for office managers to order personalized lunches for offices of any size. As part of its L.A. offerings, EAT Club also delivers lunch options from a variety of popular restaurants such as Bay Cities Italian Deli & Bakery , home to one of the “ 10 Best Sandwiches in Los Angeles ” Gracias Madre , one of LA’s 8 Best Vegan Restaurants That Would Make Bourdain Eat His Words , Cafe Gratitude , Fundamental LA and Fat Sal’s .\n“Food is an integral part of a happy, productive workplace. Having timely and consistent meals delivered right to the office frees employees up to be more productive and think big, rather than wasting time traversing the city in the search of the perfect chicken burrito,” said Larry Sales, EAT Club ’s new general manager of L.A. “Not every company has Google’s budget to spend on an endless lunch, and we think that’s okay. We’re proud of creating the ability for thousands of companies that previously couldn’t offer food to do so at scale, and I look forward to bringing this experience to L.A. – so that the city’s most delicious, critically-acclaimed restaurants are accessible to companies with the push of a button.”\nSales is a seasoned general manager with experience scaling online commerce and fostering partnerships with top food and culinary brands including Betty Crocker , Pillsbury , Starbucks , Food Network , Kraft , Calphalon , and Epicurious in his most recent role as Vice President & General Merchandise Manager at Cooking.com (now part of TCC Cooking Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Target Corporation). A veteran of the industry, Sales is passionate about food and excited to build lunch programs for EAT Club that showcase the amazing diversity L.A. has to offer. Sales earned his MBA from Stanford University and his undergraduate degree in Finance from San Diego State University.\n“These days, an awesome office culture is crucial to attracting and retaining great talent,” said Erika Kavanagh, office and culture manager at Dog Vacay , an early L.A. adopter of EAT Club. “We pride ourselves on going the extra mile to foster a fun and pleasant work environment for our employees, and EAT Club’s diverse assortment of daily food options helps us accomplish that. It frees us up to think big and focus on our dog and human customers, instead of spending time administering an office lunch program.”\n", "deleted" : false }

That looks to be what happened to Boston-based startup N2N Commerce , an e-commerce software company that was building a modern e-commerce platform for Victoria’s Secret, and had at least 70 employees. Boston is a small town. Two separate entrepreneurs there tell us that N2N Commerce is shutting down. Says one via e-mail: “Rumor has it that the product they delivered for Victoria’s Secret/Limited Brands was a total dud and VS dropped them. Almost everyone was let go late last week.”\nCalls to multiple people at N2N Commerce earlier today, including CEO Ruben Pinchanski, went unanswered. But a spokesperson for Limited Brands confirms that the startup is ceasing operations and that Victoria’s Secret will not be using its technology. Victoria’s Secret CEO Sharen Jester Turney is an N2N Commerce board member. And N2N Commerce CEO Pinchanski used to be an executive vice president at Limited Brands Direct (Limited Brands owns Victoria’s Secret). Pinchanski convinced Limited Brands and General Catalyst Partners to sink $30 million into N2N Commerce back in 2006. He was going to create a multi-channel e-commerce platform to replace Victoria’s Secret’s IBM-mainframe, silo-like infrastructure ( troubles in its distribution center may have cost Victoria’s Secret $150 million in sales last quarter).  Pinchanski even ramped up hiring last summer.

Zome CEO Brad Kayton, who co-founded digital home company 4Home ( bought by Motorola ) (s mmi) and broadband video company 2Wire ( bought by Pace ), said that he thinks Zome’s algorithms will “revolutionize the smart grid” and that the company’s software can do for the power grid what Google’s algorithms did for the web in the ’90s.\nThe algorithms have been under development since 2005, at MIT, and focus on a smarter way to link home and building devices and utility power generation. The algorithms use a framework called engineered “self-organization” where components on the network interact amongst themselves in real time and can adapt to information, in contrast to a more traditional method of a central server connecting with each component individually on the network. The concept kind of reminded me of the way that Regen Energy is using software based on swarm logic to manage appliances in buildings and electric cars like a swarm of bees or a flock of fish.\nAdvertisement\nKayton calls Zome’s technology the first type of “demand supply\nide\noptimization,” and the company plans to launch its first software product in the fourth quarter of 2011. That first tool will offer utilities analytics to take a deep dive into not-yet-deployed demand supply projects\nsmart meter networks\n. Next year, the company will start selling its “demand supply management” server to utilities that links with home and building devices that use Zome’s smart device software.\nAdvertisement\nThe idea is that utilities can use the Zome server and home devices to manage home and building energy usage in real time, and shave off up to 20 percent of energy demand from customers without them necessarily being aware of the curtailment. Demand can also be more finely tuned with supply, particularly from clean power sources, which fluctuate the amount of power they produce at any one time (the sun shines and the wind blows only at certain times of day). Zome says its system can aggregate those tiny shaved off loads from home devices, which is similar to what EcoFactor is looking to do with connected thermostats.\nAdvertisement\nZome is looking to use the emerging standard U-SNAP (Utility Smart Network Access Port) for its home and building devices, and U-SNAP wants to be a USB-like standard for switching different communications modules – such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Z-Wave and FM radio – in and out of mass-market gear like smart appliances and home energy dashboards. Zome Co-Founder Jon Rappaport also co-founded the U-SNAP Alliance , whose members include Google (s GOOG) , General Electric (s GE) , Comverge, Trilliant, 4Home and smart meter maker Sensus .\nAdvertisement\nOne of the big barriers to the idea is the slow movement of connected home energy devices. This market has been particularly slow-moving, with utility trials taking many months if not years, and consumers not being all that interested in energy-saving products. U-SNAP is also somewhat new. Zome says it has a dozen utility trials (but declined to disclose the utilities) several of which are in Ontario, a couple in the U.S. and a couple in India. (Update: Zome clarified that these are letters of intent for trials). Zome has raised $500,000 in investment and plans to raise a $1.2 million round in the fourth quarter of 2011.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

It's not an  unreasonable fear considering an estimated 40 to 50% of married  couples in the US have divorced.\nBut, anthropologist and human behavior expert at Indiana  University who's spent decades studying different aspect of love, Helen Fisher says that if  you wait about two years before getting married, it could boost  your chances of leading a happy, life-long marriage.\n\"There was a recent study in which they asked a lot of [dating]  people who were living together ... why have they not yet married  and 67% were terrified of divorce,\" Fisher said on Big Think .\n\"Terrified of not only the legal and the financial and the  economic but the personal and social fall out of divorce.\"\nInterestingly, this fear of divorce is actually giving way to  healthier marriages, overall, because people are taking more time  getting to know each other before tying the knot, Fisher said.\nAnd time is the only one way to reactivate a part of the brain —  responsible for logical decision making and planning — that shuts  down when you first fall in love with someone new, which can  explain the irrational behavior of two people who are madly in  love:\n\"One of the problems with early stage intense feelings of  romantic love is that it's part of the oldest part of the brain  that become activated — brain regions linked with drive, with  craving, with obsession, with motivation,\" Fisher, who has studied the brain on love , said. \"In fact some cognitive  regions up in the prefrontal cortex [shown below in red] that  have evolved more recently begin to shut down — brain regions  linked with decision making [and] planning ahead.\"\nPublic  Domain\nThis intense feeling of love can cloud your ability to think  logically or rationally about the person you're with. Therefore,  by allowing time for the brain to adjust to the new situation and  feelings you're experiencing, you can recognize whether who  you're dating is actually right for you.\n\"I think ... this slow love process of getting to know somebody  very carefully over a long period of time is going to help the  brain readjust some of these brain regions for decision making,\"  Fisher said. \"You're going to get to know how this person handles  your parents at Christmas ... how they handle your friends, how  they handle their money, how they handle an argument ... etc.\"\nUltimately, you want to get a good sense of your partner's  behavior during these real life situations, which is why Fisher  suggests to wait at least two years. That way, you've been around  the annual treadmill of life twice with your partner, and,  therefore, should have a good sense of how they handle themselves  under different circumstances.\n\"I think people should marry when they feel like marrying but  from what I know about the brain if it were me I'd wait at least  two years.\"\nWatch the full Big Think video of Helen Fisher explaining the  slow love process and how to maintain a happy relationship on YouTube , or  below:\n \n", "deleted" : false }

The problem isn't your lack of ability; it's the myths you believe about innovation.\nCREDIT: Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nIf you're not as creative as you'd like to be, you might tell yourself that you lack a certain something -- an inborn instinct for creativity, a natural talent for fresh ideas, the personality needed for creativity . But what if the problem wasn't something you didn't have, but something you believed?\nIf people or teams fail to live up to their creative potential, the trouble problem usually isn't a lack of ability, according to Dealstorming\nauthor Tim Sanders. The problem instead is the innovation myths you believe.\nIn a recent Big Think video Sanders explained that many of us have a warped image of creators and the creative process in our heads -- and our false beliefs set us up for creative failure. Destroy the myths and you'll remove the main obstacles keeping you from optimum creativity . Here are three he feels you and your team should dynamite.\n1. Inventors are lone wolves.\nAsk the average man or woman on the street for an example of a inventor and you'll likely get a single, famous name like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, or Steve Jobs . But common understanding and reality are very much at odds, according to Sanders.\n\"A classic example--Thomas Edison. In the invention community, Thomas Edison is a brand. It stands for 14 people. Yes there was a figurehead named Thomas Edison. His name is on 10,000 patents. He did not invent a single thing. He marshaled people together and knew how to spot innovations and put people together like a creative soup,\" he says. And Jobs? All he did \"was notice patterns and put people together to finish projects... If he doesn't have [Steve] Wozniak, there is no original Apple, right. If he doesn't have [Jony] Ive, there is no iPod. If he doesn't have Tony Fadell, there is no iPhone.\"\nSo what's the problem with believing great ideas are the products of single minds? \"Until you believe that genius is a team sport, you will never give up control,\" Sanders notes, and according to research the most creative organizations attack innovation in teams. Without the willingness to play with others there can be no teams -- and therefore less that optimal creativity.\n2. Everything all depends on a eureka moment.\nForget Newton under his apple tree and Archimedes in his bath, \"there is no such thing as a big idea that changes the world,\" insists Sanders. \"There are little ideas that combine with other little ideas that improve themselves into game-changing ideas.\"\nResearch proves this is true, Sanders claims, but he also heard it straight from Ed Catmull\n, president of Pixar. Sanders praised the writer of Toy Story to Catmull, but Catmull was keen to point out the the beloved film didn't spring fully formed from anyone's head. There was no eureka moment. \"The movie you saw, was a thousand problems solved,\" Sanders reports Catmull as saying.\nIn other words, sit around waiting for all your creative problems to be solved in one flash of inspiration and you'll be sitting around forever. On the other hand, \"if we no longer depend on the big idea to fall out of the sky and change the world, we meet more, we think more, we research more, we settle with small pieces of progress that add up to momentum,\" Sanders concludes.\n3. Experts are the source of creative ideas.\nDeep expertise has its uses -- if you're trying to land a spaceship on the moon you want the best rocket scientists money can buy on your team -- but one of those uses isn't necessarily generating the most creative ideas.\n\"Most of the great solutions to vexing problems come from the edges of a domain,\" Sanders insists. \"People that don't know what they don't know. So they're not limited by these false constraints that hold people back that are in the middle of this subject.\" If you believe that only experts can come up with game-changing ideas, then you're likely to silence some of the very people most likely to come up with the innovations you need.\n\"The minute you tell someone only experts can weigh in with ideas, everyone who's not an expert stops contributing. In my experience, it breaks down collaboration,\" says Sanders.\nAre you holding back your creativity by believing any of these innovation myths?\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\nPublished on: Feb 8, 2016\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

After two years of outsourcing to factories there, last winter they shifted production ﻿to Carlsbad, Calif., about 30 miles from their home in San Clemente. “It’s probably 30 percent cheaper to manufacture in China,” Anderson says. “But factor in shipping and all the other B.S. that you have to endure. It’s a question of, ‘How do I value my time at three in the morning when I have to talk to China?’ ”\nAs costs in China rise and owners look closely at the hassles of using factories 12,000 miles and 12 time zones away, many small companies have decided manufacturing overseas isn’t worth the trouble. American production is “increasingly competitive,” says Harry Moser, founder of the Reshoring Initiative, a group of companies and trade associations trying to bring factory jobs back to the U.S. “In the last two years there’s been a dramatic increase” in the amount of work returning.\nLightSaver executives no longer spend hours on the phone with China\nPhotograph by Michael Schmelling for Bloomberg Businessweek\nAn April poll of 259 U.S. contract manufacturers—which make goods for other companies—showed 40 percent of respondents benefited this year from work previously done abroad. And nearly 80 percent were optimistic about 2012 sales and profits, according to the survey by MFG.com, a website that helps companies find manufacturers. “A decade ago you just went to China. You didn’t even look locally,” says Ted Fogliani, chief executive officer of Outsource Manufacturing, the San Diego company working with LightSaver. “Now people are trying to come back. Everyone knows they’re miserable.”\nFor LightSaver, the decision was simple. Neither of the founders has ever been to China, which made communicating with manufacturers difficult. Components that were shipped from the U.S. sometimes got stuck in customs for weeks. And Anderson had to spend hours on the phone to explain tweaks in the product. “If we have an issue in manufacturing, in America we can walk down to the plant floor,” Anderson says. “We can’t do that in China.” Anderson says manufacturing in the U.S. is probably 2 percent to 5 percent cheaper once he takes into account the time and trouble of outsourcing production overseas.\nDana Olson makes a living convincing small manufacturers that it pays to produce domestically. About 10 percent of the roughly 60 companies that his Minneapolis firm, Ecodev, has worked with have moved manufacturing to the U.S. or decided not to send it overseas, and another half-dozen are considering similar moves. “There’s a growing sense, with the economy doing what it’s doing, of U.S. companies wanting to produce in the United States,” says Olson. “It’s very important to them to have ‘Made in the U.S.A.’ on their label again.”\nSince 2008, Ultra Green Packaging, one of Olson’s clients, has used manufacturers in China to make compostable plates and containers from wheat straw and other organic materials. By yearend, Ultra Green expects to start producing the bulk of its wares at a plant in North Dakota to cut freight costs and protect its intellectual property. “They’re infamous over there for knocking [products] off,” says Phil Levin, chairman of the 10-employee company. “All anybody needs to do is find a different factory and make a mold.”\nFor Unilife, moving production to the U.S. helped it win regulatory approval for an important product: prefilled syringes with retractable needles that make it almost impossible for medical personnel to accidentally stick themselves. Although the company used Chinese manufacturers for earlier offerings, syringes preloaded with medications are subject to stringent U.S. Food and Drug Administration rules. So in March 2011, Unilife began making its syringes at a $32 million, 165,000-square-foot plant it built in York, Pa. “The very thing in the U.S.A. that oftentimes we complain about—the complexity of the rules and the regulations—works for us,” says CEO Alan Shortall. “FDA compliance is the main reason we’re here.”\nEven with strong Mandarin skills, Brian Bethke grew frustrated with manufacturing in China. The co-founder of Pigtronix, which makes pedals that create electric guitar sound effects, discovered that he couldn’t adequately monitor quality at Chinese factories. The original idea for the company was to develop products in the U.S. and make them in China, where Bethke was living. But after several years of finding technical glitches in as many as 30 percent of pedals, the company decided to move production to Port Jefferson, N.Y. At its small factory in a Long Island office park, the company can run multiple tests on its products and even has a guitarist play each of the 500 to 1,000 pedals it sells monthly before they’re packed and shipped.\nU.S. production lets Pigtronix more extensively test its guitar pedals\nPhotograph by William Mebane for Bloomberg Businessweek\nPigtronix’s move back, completed three years ago, has helped improve cash flow. While manufacturing pedals in the U.S. can cost anywhere from three to six times as much as it does in China, Bethke says Pigtronix benefits from not having capital tied up in products that spend weeks in transit and then pile up in inventory. “In China, you have high minimum quantities you have to order, so you’re building a couple thousand of every guitar pedal,” Bethke says. “Your carrying costs start to get huge.” Today the company only makes those pedals it’s confident it can sell quickly.\nWhile goods for U.S. consumers are less likely to be made in China these days, overseas production may still make sense for companies that plan to target foreign markets. “What we’re seeing is regionalization, buying stuff from manufacturers in the region where you’re going to sell it,” says Michael Degen, CEO of Nortech Systems, a contract manufacturer based in Wayzata, Minn., that has eight factories in the U.S. and one in Mexico. “It’s very noticeable. … We’ve seen movement in terms of manufacturing in country for country.”\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The company won’t disclose much about what they’re doing, except that they’re building a Flash-based massively multiplayer online game ( MMOG ). And they certainly have the team to do it.\nSusan Wu , the founder and CEO, is a former principal at Charles River Ventures and the former CMO of the Apache Software Foundation, and has experience with MMOGs. She’s also a self-confessed World Of Warcraft addict. Her team includes Blake Commagere (CTO), a cofounder of Mogad (acquired by iSkoot); Don Neufeld (VP Engineering), the former technical director at Sony Online Entertainment where he shipped Everquest II, Planetside and 13 other products; and Scott Harsman (VP Production), the former executive producer and creative director at Sony Online Entertainment where he led development of Everquest II, Everquest and other projects.\nNeufeld and Harsman both worked at Sony Online Entertainment and brought a team with them. Wu says via email “There are very few teams that have shipped multiple MMOs across different generations of products. We are very fortunate to have Scott, Don and the team they brought over from Sony. There is a significant amount of learning that comes from having gone through dozens of MMO launches that we are applying to our products. Also, while at Sony, our team was involved in the design and implementation of their virtual goods platform.”\nThe company won’t yet give details on what type of game or platform they’re building, but they’ve convinced the venture capitalists that the idea and technology is sound. In the Fall of 2008 the company raised an undisclosed round of financing with August Capital and Rustic Canyon Partners, rumored to be in the $6 million range.\n", "deleted" : false }

He was previously the CEO of NHN USA.\nSan Francisco-based Outspark makes online action games such as Divine Souls (pictured) on its own web portal. It will be interesting to see if Yun can help the company meet its goal of finding a large audience in the mid-core gaming market. The company’s games aren’t hardcore like massively multiplayer games such as World of Warcraft. Nor are they casual, like Zynga’s social games on Facebook. Instead, Outspark makes or commissions MMOs that are free-to-play, where users can play for free and pay for virtual goods with real money. In this market, it faces rivals such as Riot Games and Kabam.\nIn an interview, Yun said that the transition to a new CEO was planned for a long time and Choe left on good terms.\n“Nothing is changing for the company, which is still focused on the mid-core gaming business,” Yun said. “This is a management change and we are still expanding to third party game makers and pursuing the free-to-play game business.”\nChoe founded Outspark in 2007 to bring Asia’s popular free-to-play online games to the U.S. market, mainly because about 6,000 wealthy users in the U.S. will generate as much revenue as 100,000 users in China. The company has managed to grow its audience to 8 million registered users. Outspark now has 3.2 million monthly unique users, up from a few months ago, Yun said.\nChoe had previously hired Owen Mahoney , a former Electronic Arts executive, to be CEO in September 2009. But he resigned in 2010 and Choe took over again as CEO. At one point, Choe acknowledged the company was in talks to be sold.\nYun was CEO of NHN USA from 2008 to 2010 and held various positions in the company dating back to 2004.\nEarlier this year, Choe said that about 9 to 10 percent of Outspark’s 3 million monthly unique users (at that time) paid for items in the game. Of those who paid money, the average revenue per paying customer was $50. Those players paid for an average of eight months, which equals a lifetime value per customer of $400. Typically, the users started paying 14 days into the game play. About 80 percent of those are males ages 16 to 30. The average session is half an hour.\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

Pleased to announce @pbailis as the next speaker @paperswelovebos on 4/21 https://t.co/xs5XMfQqgK\n— alex benik (@abenik) March 15, 2016\n“Applied science is a discipline of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, like technology or inventions.” – Wikipedia.\nI was really pleased last week when Fintan dropped this post The Welcome Return of Research Papers to Software Craft . At RedMonk we’ve been talking about the trend for a while so it’s good to see the idea captured  as a post.\n“Over the last two to three years a small, but very important and noticeable trend, has started around the world – a growing appreciation of the importance of primary research and academic papers among software practitioners. Those that are crafting software are spending more and more time understanding, learning from, and reflecting on research from the past and present.”\nThe post is really good. You should read it in full. But here’s a bit more before I jump in\nThe level of practitioner interest in research papers has risen to a point that the opening keynote at QConLondon this week was delivered by Adrian Coyler , author of The Morning Paper and a venture partner at Accel. Adrian walked people through a number of his favourite papers  and challenged people to think a little differently about what is coming in the future.\nIt is hard to pinpoint quite what caused this renewed interest, but it is safe to say that the emergence of Papers We Love , with the associated meetup groups, frequent discussions on forums such as Hacker News and blogs such as Adrian’s has created a wonderfully curated entry point to research papers for the curious. When people such as Werner Vogels at AWS remind us of the importance of papers, people sit up and take notice. As an industry we have had, at times, a tendency to forget to look at problems in detail, and instead focus on the quickest time to getting a product out the door.\nOne of the most recent Papers We Love talks came from Bryan Cantrill, CTO of Joyent , where he talked about BSD Jails and Solaris Zones , and as he noted at the start of his talk, while reminiscing about soda at the journal club his Dad, a physician, hosted:\n“I always felt that it was really interesting that medical practitioners did this, and I always try to draw lessons from other domains, and medicine is very good about this, and we are not very good about this. We in computer science and software engineering are not nearly as good about reading work, about discussing it.”\nThis. I ran a conference on exactly this theme a couple of years ago with Monki Gras 2014: Sharing Craft . My thesis is that as an industry we’re actually improving in how we learn and share across disciplines but there is a lot of work to be done. When explaining the current state of tech Netflix pretty much always features because of its leadership in multiple areas. It pays above market rate to technical staff as a matter of course, for example, in order that it only attracts top talent. Netflix has crystallized the new way of working at scale, a way of working with intellectual property not in theory but in open practice. Netflix is in effect applied science. It carries out experiments in computing at scale in order to drive the business forward. It then open sources the code it used, rinses and repeats. Netflix doesn’t theorise, file patents and then ring fence its work. On the contrary it open sources code in order to drive forward the state of the art.\nNetflix isn’t alone in this approach, of course. It’s how smart companies get things done. Stephen has written extensively about the Rise and Fall of the Commercial Software Market , and the stages our industry has gone through. Software is no longer the product, but increasingly a by-product.\nWe’ve made significant progress since Google, rather than open sourcing its own code, published the MapReduce Paper in 2004. Yahoo got Doug Cutting to build its own implementation, Hadoop, which it did open source, and the rest is history. Here are 5 Google Projects that Changed Big Data forever . The Research at Google site is a thing of beauty.\nBy engineers for engineers .\nEver since Google was born in Stanford’s Computer Science department, the company has valued and maintained strong relations with universities and research institutes. In order to foster these relationships, we run a variety of programs that provide funding and resources to the academic and external research community. Google, in turn, learns from the community through exposure to a broader set of ideas and approaches.\nBut by 2015 Google realised that open sourcing the code itself, rather than just publishing papers about its approaches, made sense. Why watch somebody else create another Hadoop or Mesos when Google could build a community around stuff it actually built – and so Kubernetes was born. Things got really interesting when Google’s engineers met engineers at Red Hat they deeply respected. When we write the history of Google this will be seen as a seminal moment, when the appliance of science became properly a community-based activity. The decision to open source some of Google’s core machine learning technology – TensorFlow  – followed naturally on the obvious and growing success of a better, more collaborative model for applied science .\nSo Netflix and Google do it. Twitter definitely does it. Apple got the memo and open sourced Swift. Facebook crowed about the success of React in 2015 . Uber and Lyft are both adopting the model. Pivotal is picking up code like NetflixOSS and Finagle  from Twitter for distributed tracing. You can bet someone at one of the tech giants is currently reading this paper, Message-Passing Concurrency for Scalable, Stateful, Reconfigurable Middleware and considering its implications. Oh look – it’s science as code, check out Kompics on Github. Maybe we should check it out in production. Let’s not forget that Linux began life in academia. And oh yeah Walmart… is making distributed systems contributions too.\nGithub, just mentioned, is a fundamental building block of the new applied science. The combination of open source, social coding (a little GIT thrown in for forking and testing and recombining) has utterly changed the game in software and distributed systems. There is no advantage in proprietary approaches – only advancing the state of the art. Well Amazon might argue, but we’ll see.\nOpen, practical innovation isn’t just a software phenomenon – check out Facebook’s Open Compute project, which implements some computer science fundamentals. There is a reason Peter Winzer, Ph.D and Head of the Optical Transmissions Systems and Networks Research Department at Bell Labs gave a talk at its most recent meeting.\nObviously I need to be a little bit careful about Golden Era thinking, but the applied science approach of cloud technology, with associated information sharing, is so very different from other spaces, in which science seems to become ever more commodified, but not commoditised. Pharma for example wants government to fund all the research, while it keeps all the profits. Companies are trying quite successfully to make genetics private science – patenting genes that occur in the wild, with terrible implications if you have a marker for say, breast cancer . The very foundations of science are being privatised. Researchers try to prevent others from replicating their work, rather than hoping for replicated experiments. It makes no sense. Tech however is showing us showing us something important about how to advance the state of the art, and that’s good for all of us. Not everything is perfect in tech, and the Industry finds ways to harvest data that should be public (or should that be private) but at least in distributed systems something very very interesting is happening. The Appliance of Science.\nPost Views: 73\n", "deleted" : false }

Users can play music, listen to audio books, and get the news of the day to name a few popular ones. However, there are some lesser known Skills that may not jump to mind quickly. We looked at the long list of Skills and found the coolest 50 things you can do with Amazon your Echo, Tap or Dot. These also work on a newly updated Amazon Fire TV thanks to the voice feature in the remote control.\nUsing the Built-in Alexa Skills\nAsk Alexa to read your Audible Audio Books.\nAmazon keeps adding new third-party skills as developers create them, but they’re also adding built-in skills. These work for all Alexa users. Here’s list of the most useful built-in skills.\nSet Alarms or Sleep Timers– Tell Alexa to “set an alarm for tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.” For a repeating alarm, say “Set a repeating alarm for weekdays at 7:00 a.m.” You can also tell Echo to turn off after 30 minutes of listening to music or a book by saying, “Set a sleep time for 30 minutes or 45 minutes.”\nFind Movie Times – Ask Alexa “When is Star Wars: The Force Unleashed playing?” or “What movies are playing?”\nRead Kind Books – Say “read my Kindle book” and it reads the open book on your Kindle. “Read Red Storm Rising” prompts Alexa to read that book from your library using the same text to speech technology from the Kindle eReader. This also works with Audible audio books.\nFind Local Businesses or Restaurants – “Find me a nearby Mexican restaurant” calls up search results via Yelp. If you need to find it later, just open the Alexa app on your phone or tablet and look at the recent interactions in what Amazon calls “cards”. The app shows reviews and further details. It also finds other business types.\nCheck Your Google Calendar – If you link your calendar in the Alexa app, you can have your device tell you what your appointments show for that day by saying Alexa, “what does May Day look like?”\nRe-order Amazon Prime Items – If you regularly order things like toilet paper or bags of candy on Amazon Prime, tell Alexa “Order more Charmin” and it will place the order asking you for a voice code first.\nGet Weather Conditions – Ask Alexa what the weather is like.\nAsk Alexa what the weather is like. Open the app or go to the website to see a more detailed report like this in your Alexa Cards.\nAdvertisement\nTo find more, head over to the help page . Also, open the Alexa Cards and see all of your interactions with Alexa. Above, you’ll see a screen shot of the website’s detailed weather report.\nAdvertisement\nHow to Add Alexa Skills to Your Echo, Dot, Tap or Fire TV\nBefore using some of these Skills, the user will need to add them to their account so that the Skill works on their device. Open the Amazon Alexa app and tap on the menu button in the upper left corner of the app.\nTap on the menu button in the upper left corner of the Amazon Alexa app and then tap on Skills.\nA menu slides in from the left side of the screen. Tap on Skills to open the Skills list. Each page lists ten Skills and the app shows over 60 pages of Skills. To narrow things down search the list of Skills using the search box at the top of the list. That’s the best way to find the Skills listed below.\nAdvertisement\nTap Enable to turn on an the Skill.\nIf you try out a Skill and don’t like it, tap on Disable and that turns it off so that Alexa won’t use it any more.\nPlease see: Amazon Tap Review\nAmazon Alexa Skills for Echo, Tap, Dot and Fire TV\nFind the complete list of current Alexa Skills at Amazon’s website . If you’re logged into your account, you can enable them from this page too.\nAdvertisement\nConnect to Home or Car Automation with these services…\nZubie – ask where you car is with a Zubie device\nMobiLinc – a home automation company that controls lights, locks, and thermostats.\nAutomatic – a device to give you car info\nStar Wars Quiz – the official trivia game from Disney\nZip Code – Ask Alexa “where is 28690” and it will give you the city and state.\nMeal Idea – Ask Alexa Meal Idea to give me meal ideas and it offers suggested meals.\nJeopardy – Play a game of Jeopardy by saying “Alexa, play Jeopardy.”\n7-Minute Workout – Do a 7-minute workout with Alexa guiding you along the way.\nUse IFTTT With Alexa\nConnect Alexa to IFTTT and use a large collection of cool IFTTT tasks.\nAmazon and IFTTT got married.

New York's attorney general says that's probably because more than half of tickets to many events are held for industry insiders or otherwise unavailable to the general public.\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a report released Thursday that his investigation of the industry was prompted by consumer complaints, which his office receives regularly.\n\"Ticketing, to put it bluntly, is a fixed game,\" the report said. Investigators found abuses and practices that prevent consumers from buying tickets at affordable prices or sometimes even getting them at all.\nInvestigators found that third-party brokers resell tickets on sites like StubHub and TicketsNow at average margins of 49 percent above face-value and sometimes more than 10 times the price. Some brokers use illegal specialty software, called \"ticket bots,\" to quickly purchase as many desirable tickets as possible for resale at significant markups, they said.\nThe report cited a single broker buying 1,012 tickets within one minute to a U-2 concert at Madison Square Garden when they went on sale on Dec. 8, 2014, despite the vendor's claim of a four-ticket limit. By day's end, that broker and one other had 15,000 tickets to U2's North American shows.\nAdvertisement\nMadison Square Garden is \"well aware of the issue of tickets getting into the hands of brokers\" and has been working to address it, spokeswoman Kimberly Kerns said. \"While there are no obvious solutions, we continually look for ways to avoid selling tickets to brokers,\" she said.\nVenues and sellers like Ticketmaster regularly tacked on fees that added more than 21 percent to the face value, investigators said. They found that on average, 16 percent of tickets are reserved for various industry insiders like the venue employees, artists and promoters, while 38 percent are reserved for presales to certain groups like holders of a particular credit card.\nTicketmaster did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThe report also criticized \"price floors,\" particularly by sports leagues and teams including the NFL and New York Yankees, which are rules meant to prevent tickets from being sold below their face value and that deprive the public of possibly cheaper tickets. Many NFL teams encourage or even require ticket holders to use Ticketmaster's NFL Ticket Exchange platform, where the seller is prohibited from cutting the price.\n\"The more aggressively sports leagues and individual teams push ticket buyers and sellers to use their 'official' secondary markets, the more serious this problem becomes,\" the report said.\n\"This investigation is just the beginning of our efforts to create a level playing field in the ticket industry,\" Schneiderman said.\nSchneiderman's office is still examining the NFL platform's price floor and whether it's anti-competitive, said an official with knowledge of investigation who wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly and declined to be identified. They want the teams to remove it, he said.\nThe attorney general also has reached settlements with two ticket brokers operating without a reseller license. The settlements require one company to pay $80,000 and the other $65,000. They and their principals also must maintain a license.\n", "deleted" : false }

Most were in New York City.\nFor the most popular concerts, the investigation found that many tickets are never made available to the general public in the first place. A majority of tickets for major entertainment events are either put on \"hold\" and reserved for a variety of industry insiders including the venues, artists or promoters, or reserved for \"pre-sale\" events and made available to non-public groups, such as those who carry particular credit cards.\nOn average, more than half of all tickets -- 54 percent – are reserved for insiders. Those reserved tickets are split between insider holds (16%) and pre-sales (38%), Schneiderman said.\nThe investigation cited the following concerts where more than 50 percent of the tickets were kept from the public, with the artist, venue, year and percentage of reserved tickets:\nJay-Z and Justin Timberlake, Yankee Stadium, 2013, 71 percent\nColdPlay and Jay-Z, Barclays Center, 2012, 70 percent\nSteely Dan, Beacon Theater (NYC), 2013, 65 percent\nFleetwood Mac, Madison Square Garden, 2013, 61 percent\n\"Ticketing is a fixed game,\" Schneiderman said. \"My office will continue to crack down on those who break our laws, prey on ordinary consumers, and deny New Yorkers affordable access to the concerts and sporting events they love. This investigation is just the beginning of our efforts to create a level playing field in the ticket industry.\"\nIn addition, the investigation found that venues and ticket sellers like Ticketmaster regularly tacked on fees that added more than 21% to the face price of tickets.\nThe AG's investigation found that third-party brokers resell tickets on sites like StubHub and TicketsNow at average margins of 49 percent above face-value -- sometimes more than 1,000 percent.\nSome of the brokers are using illegal specialty software – called \"ticket bots\" -- to quickly purchase as many desirable tickets as possible and resell them at a significant markup. The investigation, for instance, found that on December 8, 2014, a single broker used a bot to purchase 1,012 tickets to a U2 show at Madison Square Garden within the first minute they went on sale. The investigation confirms that hundreds of thousands of tickets are being acquired using illegal software.\nContact Mike McAndrew anytime | email | Twitter | 315-470-3016\nMore New York News\n", "deleted" : false }

So, when one has to pass on a game and wants to make a little of the money back, one might go set up a seller account at StubHub , RazorGator , Tickets.com , or just list them on craigslist.\nWith millions upon millions of listings between them, these sites all offer great choices for buyers and sellers alike. And, speaking at least for StubHub, tickets are free to list. Shipping is easy, or can be done quickly and digitally (depending on how you choose to list them), and you don’t have to get into a conversation with a buyer like you might on eBay or craigslist (i.e. it has confidentiality cred), and there’s a secure payment system already built in. But it’s not all sunshine and kitty cats. As a seller, StubHub is going to take a 15 percent commission, and for some people, the anonymity and confidentiality can be a limiting part of the ticket exchange.\nIt just so happens that there are a lot of people who have season tickets but don’t necessarily want to sell tickets to a stranger anonymously through a sometimes needlessly complicated transaction process. Enter: Unseat.me , a social layer built on top of StubHub that gives every ticket seller the tools to be a broker, taking advantage of the ticket marketplace as a payment processing and ticket fulfillment engine.\nUnseat.me Founder Lael Sturm conceived the idea for his startup from a simple need: He is a San Francisco Giants season ticket holder, and he wanted to sell more of his tickets to people he trusted, without the fuss and without the anonymity — and make some money while doing so.\nSturm said that his intent is not to compete with StubHub and other secondary ticket markets but to supplement them and offer sellers more options. So, for example, when a user sets up an Unseat.me account they input their season ticket seat info. Unseat.me then does an API call to see if any of those tickets are listed in StubHub, at which point the seller can just connect Unseat.me with their StubHub-listed tickets, through a simple “Buy Tix” button (which you can see in the image above). When a buyer clicks on the button, they are redirected to StubHub, which then acts as the payment and fulfillment system.\nBut Unseat.me also presents the remaining schedule for user’s team with a ‘Display/Don’t Display’ toggle button. If the user chooses to display the games, he or she can also manually input the price and quantity. That game will then appear on the frond end with a “Contact Me” button that generates an email to the page owner. The buyer and seller can then arrange to meet in person. For users that prefer to sell direct, a la Craigslist, this is the solution for them.\nBy not competing directly with StubHub, Unseat.me can remain in an agnostic position, allowing the startup to work with all the secondary ticket markets. In fact, Sturm said the startup is close to deals with several of the other markets, though he declined to say which. Remaining agnostic also allows Unseat.me to stay out of sticky exclusive agreements, like the $300 million deal recently forged between StubHub and MLB, for example.\nThe other primary focus of Unseat.me is to offer as many ways as possible for season ticket holders to go to their friends, families, and colleagues first. Unseat.me allows you to share your tickets on Facebook and Twitter right from the listing. Sturm also said that he’s considering adding LinkedIn, especially if they find serious demand among corporate ticket holders.\nThe founder also said that startups like Disrupt NYC finalist Sonar have spurred him to think about the value of proximity and geolocation at venues, as this could be a powerful tool to leverage in bringing people together to share tickets. GroupMe (and other group messaging services) could also offer interesting tools for bringing people together and cutting through the noise.\nWhen I asked Sturm if he had considered talking to StubHub about adding an Unseat.me button to StubHub listings, he said that it was a conversation he’d love to have with the ticket giant, but in the meantime, Unseat.me is very close to announcing similar integration with one of StubHub’s competitors. So there. What’s more, Facebook Connect integration should be right around the corner as well.\nAs to funding, the startup is mostly bootstrapped, with a bit of angel financing at this point, though Sturm said he’s in the process of raising a larger seed round and has had some investor interest. Revenue model? Unseat.me is still in the proof-of-concept phase, i.e. it’s all for free, but Sturm said he’s considering everything from affiliate fees from secondary ticket markets, a freemium version that provides additional functionality, fee-based promotional tools, or data products.\nIt’s still very early-stage at this point, but Unseat.me has a few interesting things going for it, especially as it will be expanding to NFL tickets soon, and I’m looking forward to see where it goes next. Stay tuned for more.\nUpdate: As of June 28, Unseat.me has added NFL season tickets to its service, and has also rolled out Facebook Connect. Up to this point, an invite code was required to join and log in, but this wall is no longer in play, as Unseat.me has lifted the veil and opened its ticketing service up to all those with an email address or a Facebook account. Excellent.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Most founders who take the time to blog or write will at some point share the following advice, “You must follow your passion. Startups are so hard that if you’re not passionate about your mission, there’s no way you’ll succeed.” At the same time, the lean startup movement has entrepreneurs everywhere “building, measuring and learning” what the market wants, to find the illusive product-market fit. But what happens when what the market wants is not what you’re passionate about?\nAs cofounder of Wellsphere, I experienced this firsthand. When we started the company in 2005, our initial plan was to create enterprise communities in which employees would support each other and gain incentives for engaging in healthier behaviors (exercising, eating right, doing yoga). We struggled to find product-market fit, so we changed our focus from enterprises to consumers, and from wellness and lifestyle to general health and medicine. Although the shift in focus from wellness to medicine made sense in terms of finding a larger market (especially given the consumer-focus), I personally have never been passionate about medicine. For whatever reason, I have always been passionate about helping people go from zero to ten, rather than minus ten to zero.\nAdvertisement\nPassions aside, we eventually developed an extremely effective content aggregation and distribution strategy, growing from 100,000 unique visitors a month to 6 million in less than 18 months (which we felt pretty good about in the pre-open-graph virality days). We began talking to most of the major online health companies about partnering to sell ads against our growing inventory, and we started to receive acquisition interest.\nAdvertisement\nAt the end of 2008, after four intense, emotional years, we were faced with the choice of selling the company or charging forward toward our next funding milestone. I had to ask myself, “Do I have the energy and the passion to charge ahead?” As individuals and as a team, we all had to answer this question. We ended up deciding to sell the company to IAC-backed The Health Central Network.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough we had a successful outcome, especially in the face of one of the most challenging acquisition environments in the last decade, we still had a long way to go toward fulfilling the company’s potential as an independent consumer health organization. I think if we had been focused on what we were passionate about rather than product-market fit, things might have played out differently.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSure, there are those lucky few entrepreneurs who hit it on the first try, chasing their passion and finding a perfectly overlapping market need. But for the rest of us, how do we decide between team passion versus market pragmatism?\nAdvertisement\nI think it’s a false choice that many entrepreneurs make, whether out of convenience, lack of creativity, or simply because they don’t realize that there’s a third option. As if starting a company isn’t hard enough, I recommend you make it even harder — don’t settle for what you’ve discovered the market wants if it doesn’t intersect with what you and your team are passionate about doing. Keep iterating. Think of it as an investment in your future energy and in the long-term potential of your company. Only when you’ve created a product that your team is passionate about and meets the needs of a large market should you move ahead and scale the company. Do not stop at product-market fit , make sure you find product-team-market fit. From there, you’ll find the journey toward scaling a large, successful business more energizing and fun, and your chances of making it through the challenges and speed bumps that lie ahead will increase exponentially. The most important, and most scarce, ingredient to startup success is human energy. Building a product that your team is passionate about will leverage that scarcest of resource, maximize your chances of success, and enrich your life.\nAdvertisement\nDave Kashen is founder of Quantum Leading , a leadership and culture development firm for startups, and the Unleashed conference series .

Check out these health research sites.\n@donreisinger\nI am, sadly, well-acquainted with medical research sites. (I broke my back years ago, and am still dealing with the recovery.) But while everyone knows WebMD and probably uses the site to find out about medical conditions, you might be surprised to know there are a slew of sites that offer similar service, providing outstanding medical information. I've found these sites to be good resources.\nHealthiNation\nWhile some sites deliver articles of medical information, HealthiNation uses videos to inform you about what a condition is all about.\nOverall, HealthiNation is designed quite well and its easy to search for videos. The site doesn't boast articles like those you'll find on sites like WebMD, but its videos are extremely informative and I found that when I searched for simple issues like \"back pain,\" the clips were just as useful as when I searched for more complex topics like diabetes.\nHealthiNation's videos are split into general health, men's health, women's health, and \"true life stories,\" which detail how one person faced medical conditions in their lives. Each section features information that's worth perusing through, regardless of the topic.\nThe videos on HealthiNation were outstanding. Each is clearly defined and once you fire them up, you'll be presented with a wealth of knowledge by health care professionals. But because HealthiNation relies on videos, the scope of its medical coverage isn't nearly as great as I would have liked and it only covers general topics. A specific condition, such as spondylolysis, isn't included on the site, though it is on competing services, like WebMD. Realizing that, it's best to use HealthiNation when you want information on general health topics.\nLivestrong\nAlthough Livestrong , which is co-founded by bicyclist Lance Armstrong, is touted as a \"lifestyle\" site that helps you achieve greater health and fitness, it's also a great resource for health research.\nThe first thing that will strike you about Livestrong is its almost unbearable design. It's yellow, black, and cluttered. It's a mess.\nThat said, the site is rich in features and its search tool is outstanding. Instead of trying to find information on the home page, immediately enter your query into the search box and you'll be brought to a results page featuring information on a wide array of topics. From back pain to diabetes, the site not only features videos like HealthNation, which are narrated by health care professionals, but it also boasts informative articles on all the topics. I was impressed by how much information the site actually has on any given topic.\nBut much like HealthiNation, Livestrong doesn't support obscure ailments and I was a little disappointed that in the entire discussion on back pain, the site failed to address individual issues that might affect different areas of the spine. Regardless, Livestrong is a unique destination that makes using it every day worthwhile if you want to be healthier.\nMedpedia\nThe Medpedia Project is a joint effort on the part of Harvard Medical School, Stanford School of Medicine, Berkeley School of Public Health, and other global health organizations that hope the site will change \"how the world will assemble, maintain, critique and access medical knowledge.\" It delivers.\nThe site features a repository of up-to-date medical information, contributed and maintained by health professionals from around the world. The site also boasts a professional network and directory for visitors to find health professionals and organizations, a communities of interest section where medical experts and patients can share conditions and treatments, and a growing knowledge base featuring information on health issues ranging from back pain to diabetes.\nI was generally impressed by the level of detail Medpedia offered. The site's knowledge base is a wiki that allows you to search for specific ailments or ask general questions that might already have been answered by the community of doctors. At first glance, the idea that a health site is a Wiki may turn some off, but to ensure all the information on the site is accurate, Medpedia only allows physicians and those with a Ph.D. to edit the articles, and only once their credentials are certified. That cuts down on the number of erroneous bits of information that crop up on the site and, in my opinion, makes the site more reliable than a resource like Wikipedia, which anyone can modify.\nWhen I entered \"back pain\" into the site's search field, I was brought to a results page that not only featured a Wiki containing general information about the ailment and links to other, related Medpedia Wikis, but also a series of answers provided by doctors to questions asked by the site's users. And although some weren't directly targeted at my query, I could have easily asked my own set of questions, which would have been answered directly by a medical professional.\nI should note, though, that Medpedia is still in beta and was launched Tuesday. Because of that, the site doesn't offer every conceivable health topic and a few obscure conditions are still missing. But more Wiki pages are being added each day and the community of doctors and patients is growing. It might not be WebMD yet, but it's off to a good start. Read more on Medpedia .\nWebMD\nWebMD is the leader in the health research space and it boasts more features and options than any other site in this roundup. WebMD is simply the best health research tool on the market.\nMy biggest complaint with WebMD has nothing to do with its information and everything to do with its design: it's ugly. I was happy to see that the site features a prominent search box at the top of the page, but its home page is cluttered with blogs, articles, and other information that I ignore because there's simply too much information packed into a small page.\nThe real value of WebMD is seen in its search. From something simple like \"back pain\" to something complex like \"spondylolysis,\" the site has it all. I was impressed by the wealth of information WebMD provides and its simple articles actually provided me with more information that the videos on HealthiNation or the articles on Livestrong. It was outstanding.\nBeyond its information service, WebMD's drug finder is an outstanding tool that helps you learn all about a particular prescription medicine you're using. It comes in handy when you need to find out if you're experiencing sickness or a side effect from a medication and it's an ideal tool when you want to determine if a generic brand of a particular drug is suitable in place of the name brand. It's easily one of my favorite tools and one that shouldn't be overlooked when you're using WebMD.\nWebMD is a great service that will provide you with all the health information you're looking for in as little time as possible. And although its design is downright awful and it should be addressed, its articles make up for that lackluster design and make it the best health research service in this roundup.\nWellsphere\nWellsphere is a nice health research site that aims at making you healthier through education. It works--the site's articles deliver basic information like symptoms and treatment, and its prevention information is the best on the market.\nWellsphere looks like a simple site when you surf to the home page, but once you dig deeper and start searching for medical conditions, you'll be shocked to find that it's actually a complex site featuring basic information on an ailment, question and answers between doctors and patients, news, pictures, videos, and a communities tab that allows you to compare notes with other users.\nAlthough Wellsphere doesn't offer as many articles as WebMD, the site and its writers, which are health experts from Stanford and other prominent institutions around the U.S., provide a good amount of information. From the simple overview to the ability to ask a specific question to the \"health maven,\" the site's possibilities are endless.\nOn a simple search like back pain, I was astonished at the level of detail Wellsphere provided. Not only did it provide articles detailing back pain and how to address it, but I was able to ask questions which were answered promptly by a professional and its videos were outstanding, providing more information than comparable clips on HealthiNation.\nWellsphere is an outstanding service. Although it doesn't have the same coverage as WebMD, it's just as informative and its \"health maven\" tool is outstanding. If you don't want to deal with the clutter and ugliness of WebMD, check out Wellsphere. I think you'll like it.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

On Thursday, the company is announcing several significant updates to its service, including the ability to privately message specific specialists for a small fee.\nAdvertisement\n“We’re bringing the house call back,” said co-founder and CEO Ron Gutman. “We’re connecting you to physicians in the convenience of your home, office [or] coffee shop. We’re connecting you with a real person who’s knowledgeable and accessible.”\nAdvertisement\nAs healthcare moves online and to mobile devices, Gutman said, HealthTap wants to be the trusted network for providing immediate access to reliable health information. “On the Internet, every headache becomes a brain tumor in four clicks or less,” he joked. A growing number of companies, including startups like  Meddik  and  Symcat ) are trying to provide people with better health information, but HealthTap’s bet is that people will still want to consult with real doctors, not just data-driven algorithms.\nAdvertisement\nAnd consumer health is a space Gutman knows well. As a graduate student, he led a personalized health research project that ultimately became a university-implemented health and well-being program for employees. Prior to HealthTap, he was founder and CEO of health 2.0 site WellSphere, which was later acquired by HealthCentral. The company has raised nearly $14 million from investors including the Mayfield Fund, Mohr Davidow Ventures, Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors and angel investors Esther Dyson and Aaron Patzer, founder and former CEO of Mint.com\nAdvertisement\n‘DocScore’ rankings help patients find most relevant doctors\nAdvertisement\nWith the new app, users can continue to pose anonymous questions to the general network of 12,000 doctors for free. Or, they can use the app to search for a specific doctor in one of 112 specialities (and in their location, if they want) to ask a question via a targeted private message. Along with the doctor’s name, specialties and other information, the service will indicate a doctor’s immediate availability. If a green dot is displayed, it means the patient can send the doctor a private, HIPAA-secure message, which can include images, lab tests and other records that could give the doctor a better window into the patient’s condition.\nAdvertisement\nHealthTap charges users $9.99 for one message (plus a clarification message if they don’t understand the doctor’s reply). If they want to continue the conversation, the app charges an additional $4.99. (The app also allows doctors to distribute promo codes, which can allowthem to consult with current patients through the app or develop relationships with new patients.)\nAdvertisement\nThe price might sound steep for a text message, but compared to seeing a doctor in person, it’s cheaper and much more convenient. According to HealthTap’s research, the average co-pay is $29, and a 2009 survey of family physicians found that the average wait time to get an appointment can be 20 days. For the one-quarter of doctor visits that are mainly informational Q&A sessions (according to HealthTap figures), the company’s service is a compelling alternative.\nAdvertisement\nHealthTap is about information, not practicing medicine online\nAdvertisement\nGutman says HealthTap’s intent isn’t to migrate the practice of medicine to the Web but to give people better access to quality health. For example, unlike Ringadoc , a recently launched startup that enables video chats between doctors and patients, HealthTap doctors won’t prescribe medication or diagnose conditions. Startups providing tele-health services are constrained by some state medical boards, so they tend to operate only in certain states. HealthTap’s focus on education might also make the platform more attractive to doctors concerned about liability issues.\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to the private messaging and micropayments features, HealthTap rolled out several features today. Here are a few more interesting ones:\nAdvertisement\nThe ‘DocScore’\nTo help patients find the most relevant doctors in HealthTap’s network, the company assigns each doctor a ranking based on publicly-available information (for example, their medical school, residency, number of years in practice, and other data points), as well as the reviews of other doctors on the site. As doctors respond to anonymous patient questions, their HealthTap peers can weigh in to “agree” or “disagree,” which can increase or decrease their overall ranking on the site.\nAdvertisement\n The ability to follow specific doctors to get personalized information\nTo keep up with information most specific to their concerns and conditions, patients can follow the comments of specific doctors on the site, as well as topics and questions they care about.\nAdvertisement\nA secure digital health file\nAs patients correspond with doctors on the site, HealthTap archives the information securely and privately. Users can also use the site to store information not exhanged on the site (such as test results, vaccination records, etc.) At any time, the company said, users can transfer the information.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

As a result, nearly $7.2 billion worth of ad spend is lost to nonhuman traffic, with overall ad fraud totaling $18.5 billion .\nThis is happening because ad fraud is a more lucrative organized crime than credit card fraud, counterfeiting goods or being a Somali pirate where the reward far outweighs the risk of being caught, according to ad fraud expert Augustine Fou .\nAlthough fraud in the ad ecosystem is by no means a new issue, the scale at which it’s accelerating is cause for serious concern. Unfortunately, the lack of universal standards for identifying fraudulent traffic only compounds the problem.\nLarger Issues\nThe ad fraud problem is so rampant that 37% of advertisers say they are willing to pay a 11% premium or more for MRC-certified, human traffic, according to IAB’s Internet Advertising Report . By tackling ad fraud, players in the space have the opportunity to protect their brand clients and reduce the investment wasted on fraudulent traffic.\nThere are a handful of larger issues preventing the industry from wiping out ad fraud in its entirety. By and large, there are no widely accepted standards for measuring or determining bot traffic. Those who work in ad ops can surely attest to this. They may think campaigns are running well per their ad verification partner only to get a report from another verification partner that they are running fraudulent traffic.\nDue to the competitive nature of the brand-safety players, there is a “black box” factor as to why one vendor categorizes a site as fraudulent, but another does not. Ad verification partners keep a closed lid on their methodologies used to identify traffic as nonhuman, as they would naturally lose competitive advantage by sharing information.\nIt’s a Catch-22, which is why ad fraud is such a complex problem to solve.\nIf organizations are entirely transparent, all the bad actors would quickly learn how bots are flagged and reverse engineer the process. However, there needs to be a greater degree of transparency between fraud prevention organizations, advertisers and their agency partners to tackle the issue head-on, with accuracy and speed.\nSo, what are the most effective tools to combat fraud?\n“All of this starts with transparency,” said Ron Amram, Heineken USA’s vice president of media, in a recent interview . “The more you can work with the vendors to remove fraud, the better chance we have at cleaning the ecosystem at the root.”\nIndustry Moves\nThe October 2015 Media Ratings Council’s guidelines requiring ad verification vendors to separate reporting of invalid traffic into “general” (data center traffic and/or bots and spiders) and “sophisticated” (intentionally misrepresented traffic) categories are a step in the right direction of unifying types of invalid traffic. This helps technology buyers compare the proverbial apples to apples.\nThe IAB also has had working groups for years regarding fraud, developing a unifying taxonomy of fraud to get all players in the industry talking the same language. And finally, with the creation of the Trustworthy Accountability Group in 2015, there is an entity focused directly against the fraud issue.\nAlthough the issue of consistency with anti-fraud solutions is less prominent than it was a year or two ago, the fact is that different digital channels with different technical builds still require changes in strategy, implementation and internal process management.\nFor this reason, brand safety isn’t “a set it and forget it” kind of problem. What we can accomplish in terms of eliminating ad fraud on mobile channels may be entirely different from the solution for video or social channels.\nTaking Responsibility\nThere is general agreement that ad fraud is everyone’s problem and we should all be held accountable. However, action speaks louder than words.\nEach party – brand, agency and technology partner – should be fully responsible for their individual piece of the puzzle. Strategies that leverage pre-bid blocking, real-time blocking and post-IMP reporting are steps in the right direction to prevent acts of fraud before both time and money have been wasted.\nBrand safety will likely have no quick fix or one-size-fits-all solution, but the goal is that by tackling some of these key issues we can start putting some of that $18.5 billion back into the pockets of advertisers and agencies by delivering digital ads to credible, human traffic.\nEveryone needs to own their share of accountability by providing a clear understanding of how their organizations are combating fraud. We need to have partnerships in place to stay ahead of fraud’s next evolution.\n“It’s a game of chess against an opponent that is constantly changing the rules,” said Andres Ferrate , Google’s chief advocate of ad traffic quality.\nFor the ad industry to win, we must be smarter and more effective than our challenger.\nFollow Eric Monian ( @ejaydante ), Amobee ( @amobee ) and AdExchanger ( @adexchanger ) on Twitter.\n", "deleted" : false }

We find ourselves lost in a bewildering sea of boring, undifferentiated, incomplete offerings, smothered by advertising. The innovative community of Web creators who could actually meet our needs don’t know where we are or how to find us, largely because the locations where we could connect are bound by a rigid, failed ideology of search engine optimization, location-generated content, and traffic-based currency.\nThis is how I look at the Web and how I set up my presentation —all six minutes of it—at the semi-annual DEMO conference in Palm Desert, CA, a couple of weeks ago.

As part of the deal, @WalmartLabs will bring in a total of 16 employees from Luvocracy, including founder and CEO Nathan Stoll . Luvocracy offered a Pinterest-like experience where friends and tastemakers can recommend products for others. Now that team will be working to help Walmart.com improve its own product discovery features for shoppers.\nThe San Francisco-based online community was founded in 2011 by Stoll, who sold his social search company Aardvark to Google back in 2010. The goal of Luvocracy, again, was to capitalize on the power of social connections, but this time, rather than building better search, the idea was to help people find new products from people they trust.\nLuvocracy also offered mobile apps for iOS and Android  that let you “love” items and filter your feed by trending, featured and trusted product recommendations.\nHowever, in the years since the startup’s debut, Pinterest has come to dominate the social product recommendations space, though it has been more slowly moving in the direction of commerce than Luvocracy did, which featured at launch at “Buy it for Me” service that allowed a simple way to purchase the products you found and loved on its site. Others, including sites like Fancy and Wanelo, also cater to this audience.\nThanks to Stoll’s connections and experience, Luvocracy had raised $11 million in funding from Kleiner Perkins, Google Ventures, Marissa Mayer, Ali Pincus, Jim Lanzone, Tony Robbins, CrunchFund (which was founded by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington), RPM Ventures and XG Ventures.\nWalmartLabs did not disclose deal terms.\nIn addition to Stoll, the deal for Luvocracy also sees a few other notable team members from the startup joining WalmartLabs, including VP of Design Brooke Thompson, previously a Senior Director of Design at Yahoo responsible for their Communications, Communities and Home Page products; VP of Engineering Ajay Agrawal, who formerly was SVP of engineering at Blurb held roles at eBay, Microsoft and Oracle; and Creative director Christine Martinez, a Pinterest “Power Pinner” with over 5 million followers, who also founded LAMA, an e-commerce boutique that represented global artists and makers.\nOf Luvocracy’s 20 team members, 16 are relocating to Walmart eCommerce’s HQ in San Bruno, Calif.\nLargely an acqui-hire, Walmart is more interested in the talent behind Luvocracy and not the product itself.\nGoing forward, the plan is to shut down the Luvocracy service, but the details as to how this will be communicated to Luvocracy’s half a million members have not yet been ironed out.\nHowever, at Walmart, the team will be tasked with working on similar challenges, though at a larger scale. Specifically, the team will work to innovate on “design, product and discovery shopping,” the retailer says.\n“There’s no bigger stage in commerce than Walmart, and the opportunity to take our vision of social discovery and decision-making in commerce to their audience of hundreds of millions across the world was incredibly attractive,” says Stoll. “And I am super excited about the opportunity to work with the very talented team they’ve been building. Right now, their organization for global e-commerce is about the same size Google was when I joined in 2002 — with the opportunity for huge growth to come as they have so much untapped potential,” he adds.\nWalmartLabs has been helping Walmart grow its technical talent through acquisitions over the years, many of which have contributed to large-scale improvements and changes to its e-commerce properties. For instance, one of its earlier acquisitions, Kosmix, was behind  the revamped search engine on Walmart.com released in 2012.\nThe company has also acquired a number of companies to help it face down rival Amazon, including site-speed optimizer Torbit , data analytics and predictive intelligence startup Inkiru , adtech startup Adchemy , mobile agency Small Society , cloud computing startup OneOps, and many others.\n \n", "deleted" : false }

The deal indeed has been greenlighted, as Microsoft confirmed in its blog post yesterday . However, at the time, the price of the acquisition was unclear; several sources (who wished to remain anonymous) pegged the number at $70 million. But, today we’ve heard from a solid source that the actual price of the acquisition was actually just under $100 million — in cash.\nSure, it’s not quite the $8.5 billion Microsoft paid for popular voice and video-over-IP service, Skype , but for a relatively young startup, this is a big win. As to its backstory, VideoSurf was founded by four Israeli entrepreneurs, Eitan Sharon, Lior Delgo, Shai Deljo, and Achi Brandt in 2006, and the San Mateo-based startup has since raised $28 million from a bunch of notable investors, which include Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and her husband, SurveyMonkey CEO David Goldberg, along with Al Gore and Current Media CEO Joel Hyatt (as well as a few others, like Pitango VC and Verizon Ventures.)\nWhy did Microsoft make this acquisition? Well, just as Microsoft plans to integrate Skype into Xbox Live and VideoKinect for Xbox Live to allow gamers to Skype from their consoles, the tech giant plans to add VideoSurf’s technology into the Xbox 360 ecosystem (specifically Xbox Live) as well. Microsoft will be rolling out voice search over the holiday season and is currently in the process of integrating content from video and cable providers (like Verizon, Comcast, HBO and Epix, for example) into Xbox Live.\nMicrosoft is also adding a search layer over the platform to let users search for content from apps and beyond, so that one searching for Lord Of The Rings might get results from Netflix, or Comcast’s library, or apps from its Zune Marketplace. Because VideoSurf’s platform is all about video discovery and allowing users to quickly find video content from a wide range of websites (like Hulu, Dailymotion, Metacafe, etc.), this will amp up Xbox Live’s search criteria, which, at this point, just relies on metadata offered up by the content provider.\nNot only that, but VideoSurf also implements some cool audio recognition technology along with facial recognition functionality that allows the startup to pull from specific frames within videos, which, when combined, the company (and Microsoft clearly agrees) can provide better search results (and relevancy) coupled with an enhanced user experience.\nThis is also a smart move play by Microsoft when looking at its future ambitions for both Xbox Live and search on the whole. As Xbox Live adds content from other independent video providers, VideoSurf’s multifaceted search technology can provide a much-improved means of parsing video content from these indie providers that typically don’t have the same amount of data tied to their videos as the larger, premium content providers. If and when Microsoft adds YouTube to Xbox Live, they will need an enhanced search mechanism to serve refined results from the some-billion-odd videos YouTube counts in its bullpen.\nMicrosoft could also leverage VideoSurf technology for Bing’s video search, making search a less-painful experience across its devices. Considering the startup’s technology will allow Kinect users to search and discover content across multiple entertainment providers within Xbox Live and use Kinect’s voice search powered by Bing, you can see the sizable value proposition inherent in this acquisition. This could allow Microsoft, via Kinect’s unique interface, to offer rich web-based search through TV — potentially leaping over Google based on its current efforts to do the same with Google TV.\nIt will be interesting to see how the Xbox ecosystem improves with Skype and VideoSurf integration, but the future is definitely looking somewhat bright — something that’s not always said in when referring to the tech old timer.\nFor more, check out Microsoft’s press release here , and VideoSurf at home here .\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

What do you do to make sure that you keep your company’s (and your clients’) confidential information safe, when someone who is no longer on your team might still have the passwords to the apps you use?\nWhen it comes to collaborative tools such as project management apps, you can usually apply different levels of access to each team member. Still, have you figured out what to do when someone from the team departs?\nAdvertisement\nYou have a few options:\nAdvertisement\nDelete their account. But what happens if that account contains data that applies to work you’re still doing, or time reporting you are still running?\nMake the account inactive. But does this mean the account still counts against your user quotas, or will it give you an open space to add a new member without increasing your service level?\nChange the username and password. But is this really a secure option?\nAdvertisement\nMy company’s virtual team (over a dozen people) are using 5pm , so I contacted the company to see what they recommend doing in the situation of a team member leaving and what their service supports. They acknowledged that workers leaving a company is an interesting issue and recommended changing the login email address used on the account and the password. While they suggested using a fake email, I’m thinking using an alternative email address to which you have access would be a better solution.\nAdvertisement\n5pm’s programmers are able to restore data if you accidentally delete something you didn’t intend to remove, but they also pointed to the “Backup” feature that allows you to pull your data from the cloud onto a computer before you make any changes if personnel has changed. The company is considering an “active/inactive” flag for users, but also said that since their plans are based on the number of users, they were concerned that people might turn this feature on and off to get around upgrading to a premium level.\nAdvertisement\nCurious to see how other project management tools handled the issue of security when a team member departs, I approached Wrike and LiquidPlanner with my scenario as well.\nAdvertisement\nThe folks at Wrike suggested that the best way to protect against potential sabotage is to deal first with the issue on the HR and legal side, rather than relying on your cloud vendor. While I agree with this in theory, most startups don’t have an HR department or a legal team to enforce issues, and much of what happens with team members happens swiftly and potentially irreparably in a bad situation. Contracts can’t keep disgruntled individuals from commiting sabotage. Wrike has a “merge” feature so you can actually merge the data of one user into the account of another. The account can be kept active with a changed username and password, or removed after merging data to downgrade an account if money is an issue. The Wrike folks also say they have multiple levels of backups and a friendly, helpful customer service team at the ready to assist in a crisis situation to help retrieve lost data or protect an account. They may, however, require a fee to cover the time of their programmers.\nAdvertisement\nLiquidPlanner lets you immediately “disconnect” a user from the collaborative workspace if they leave the team, so a former employee can no longer log in to view or modify the team’s project information. This feature makes their account inactive. This disconnection feature eliminates the need to change a login and password as a stop gap measure. The workspace remains secure. The inactive user’s projects and tasks will remain accessible and intact so the rest of the team can access all the data related to their account. Inactive users do not count against the user quota for a LiquidPlanner account. If you disconnect a user from a workspace at any time and then they return to the team, you can simply invite the same person back into the space by “reconnecting” them.\nAdvertisement\nBefore you run into a crisis situation with your project management system, here are a few things to look into today:\nAdvertisement\nCheck to see if the apps you use have a way to back up your data.\nSee what the company recommends in terms of security actions to take if a team member leaves abruptly.\nCheck if there are fees for restoring data via the company’s main backup system.\nWrite out your internal plan for keeping your company’s project management space secure.\nAdvertisement\nWhat is your plan for keeping your collaborative spaces secure?\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

The company said around 10 percent of check-in data from applications like Foursquare comes from mobile sites.\nThe mobile site is similar to the application and is designed to feel like a native app like the one available on the iPhone and Android devices.

A network could add a widget to a TV show website, and fans could then use a widget to say, “I’m watching Doctor Who,” which could then be shared on Facebook, Twitter, and within the GetGlue app itself.\nBroadcast companies like USA, Showtime, and Discovery are already using GetGlue check-ins.\nFoursquare, another incredibly popular check-in application that focuses on location instead of content, also has a browser-based check-in service.

For viewers, there's no escape--the talking bubble will follow them as they scroll down the page.\nAnnoying and obtrusive, yet compelling CNET Networks\nThe service is by no means a full-fledged video blogging tool; it falls into a strange subcategory between video messaging and a pop-up advertisement. It's also a little early in development, offering no way to save and track the messages you've created. For now the service is free, but a paid subscription version is on the way for about $10 a month.\nWe thought long and hard about the usefulness of this for the casual user. In truth, video embedding services from YouTube or Viddler is much more user friendly. Users can turn those videos on and off at their discretion and pass any interesting ones along to a friend.

We’re also going to have fun with a team-building exercise.\nJeri Ellsworth of CastAR will talk about the underdog’s tale of creating a new augmented reality platform in a chat with UploadVR’s Will Mason. John Riccitiello of Unity has been warning about a wave of disappointment coming in the wake of VR hype, and he’ll update us on his views in a fireside chat with Entertainment Software Association CEO Mike Gallagher. Mihai Pohontu of Samsung will talk about how that big company is making investments in game platforms and VR. And Paul Bettner, the CEO of Playful and creator of the Lucky’s Tale game on the Oculus Rift, will take us into the future with a talk on VR with GamesBeat’s Jeff Grubb.\nThe GamesBeat event is about the global business of gaming, which is growing in so many ways and becoming a bigger part of the entertainment and technology industries. We’ve designed this year’s summit to be a more intimate experience for the leaders of the gaming world. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and esports are re-energizing developers. Our speakers will shed light on the landscape and help you make the right decisions so your company can grow. We’ll have a lot of fun events, like a Microsoft reception with s’mores and whiskey.\nIf you want to apply for an invitation, please  click here . And here is the full agenda .\nAbove: The International Game Developers Association chief Kate Edwards talks game-design job satisfaction with USGamer senior editor Kat Bailey at GamesBeat 2015.\nImage Credit: Michael O'Donnell/GamesBeat\nOur previously announced speakers include:\nKate Edwards, executive director of the IGDA. She will address the topic of uncompensated crunch time in a roundtable at the summit. Edwards said that the game industry has always had extreme works hours that eventually became accepted as “normal.” These extended periods of crunch time require people to go work far beyond standard hours to make up for the company’s inability to effectively manage a project and/or manage creative expectations for a given time frame. While crunch is a reality of most every creative medium, there is a better way to manage its infliction on employees, primarily by instituting a policy of upfront disclosure and enabling employees to choose the kind of conditions in which they will create, Edwards said.\nAbove: Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, on stage at GamesBeat 2015 with Dean Takahashi.\nImage Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat\nTim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Sweeney has spent 25 years as graphics guru and maker of games such as Unreal and Gears of War, as well as the upcoming release Paragon. Sweeney is one of the brains behind the Unreal Engine, one of the vital tools for the development of 3D games on everything from mobile to high-end virtual reality titles.\nHe also understands that business, technology, and games are intimately linked . He has been a passionate speaker on openness for the PC and recently tangled with Microsoft on its approach to openness in Windows 10 .\nSweeney has been one of the industry’s seers when it comes to 3D graphics in video games. He recently predicted that game developers would use VR to create games , and he gave a talk at the ChinaJoy 2015 event, where he  predicted that perfect augmented reality glasses could one day mean that we won’t need big-screen monitors, TVs, or even smartphone or tablet screens. His reasoning: If we have the equivalent of 40-feet screens in front of our eyes at any time we want (maybe in the next decade), the rest of the screens in our lives become superfluous.\nAbove: Paul Bettner\nImage Credit: Dean Takahashi\nLucky’s Tale creator Paul Bettner, the CEO of Playful. Bettner’s 3D platformer title Lucky’s Tale is bundled with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, and it’s a blend of Crash Bandicoot and Mario in a new dimension. Bettner started Playful to create VR experiences. His previous studio, Newtoy, was acquired by Zynga, and Words With Friends is still one of Zynga’s top titles. Bettner is one of the few game developers who has already launched a major title for the VR headsets, and we’d like to know what he’s learned.\nAbove: Sam Barlow wins grand prize for Her Story at IGF.\nImage Credit: Dean Takahashi\nSam Barlow, the creative director at Interlude. Barlow was a big winner at the Game Developers Choice Awards and the Independent Games Festival in March. Her Story uses full-motion video to tell the tale of a missing man. It focuses on police interviews with his wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert. Barlow is a game director and writer who has been making games since his cult 1999 title Aisle. Barlow has an extensive history of making games that create deep personal connections with their players. With Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, he created a classic that psychologically profiled Wii gamers.\nAbove: Dan Fiden, the chief strategy officer at FunPlus.\nImage Credit: Dean Takhashi\nThe investor panel speakers include Dan Fiden, the chief strategy officer at Beijing-based FunPlus, which recently set up a $50 million fund to invest in mobile games and other game-related companies. He’ll be joined in the roundtable by Jay Eum, the managing director at Translink Capital; Phil Sanderson, the managing director at IDG Ventures; and Sunny Dhillon, a partner at Signia Venture Partners. They’ll talk about everything from virtual reality to mobile game investments and what draws their attention as seasoned investors in the game startup ecosystem.\nAbove: Kathy Astromoff, the vice president of developer success at Twitch.\nImage Credit: Twitch\nKathy Astromoff, the vice president of developer success at Twitch, the largest game livestreaming video platform and community for gamers. She has extensive experience in game developer relations and business marketing, including stints at Sega, Ageia, and Game Developers Conference parent UBM. Kathy has contributed to the International Game Developers Association in various roles, including foundation trustee, board chair, and women’s SIG contributor. She follows Cal football through thick and thin, and her favorite scotch is not too peaty.\nAbove: Amy Jo Kim, game designer.\nImage Credit: Amy Jo Kim\nVeteran game designer Amy Jo Kim will talk about helping clients find their “alpha moment” in game design and how that can level the playing field for game developers around the world. Kim has a background in neuroscience, computer science, and psychology. She has applied that knowledge to both game design and web community architecture. Her design credits include Rock Band, The Sims, Ultima Online, eBay, Family.com, Nytimes.com, Indiegogo.com, and numerous startups. In 2000, she published the book Community Building on the Web. She has a doctorate in behavioral neuroscience from the University of Washington and is an adjunct game design professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts.\nJohn Riccitiello, the CEO of Unity Technologies, is returning for the second year to our GamesBeat Summit. Riccitiello has been expanding Unity’s reach as a game engine that is democratizing game development by making it easier than ever to make games and publish them across platforms. And now he is adding services for game developers such as advertising and monetization. The former CEO of Electronic Arts is also reportedly raising money at a very healthy valuation. We’re looking forward to quizzing him on a variety of topics in a fireside chat.\nOwen Mahoney, the CEO of Nexon. Mahoney is a veteran of the GamesBeat stage, and he continues to make interesting strategic moves in gaming. Most recently, the company acquired DomiNations developer Big Huge Games, a Western studio founded by game pioneers Brian Reynolds and Tim Train. Mahoney has been signing up a lot of famous game developers, mostly by  pitching gaming as an art form . He spoke at last fall’s GamesBeat 2015 event, and we’re happy to have him back.\nJeri Ellsworth, the cofounder of augmented reality glasses maker  CastAR , will talk about augmented reality glasses based on the company’s new platform. CastAR glasses will be able to overlay animations and other imagery on top of the real world. It’s a creative product from an interesting hardware tinkerer. Ellsworth taught herself how to design chips and became known in 2004 for creating a Commodore 64 system on a chip with a joystick. She went on to become a hardware hacker and was part of a team of researchers at Valve, the maker of the Half-Life games and the new SteamVR virtual reality technology.\nMike Gallagher, the CEO of the  Entertainment Software Association . Gallagher is returning to speak as the chief lobbyist for the game industry. We caught him recently at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, where he aggressively defended and praised  the game industry for its fast growth and expansion to new platforms. Gallagher is the chief spokesman for an industry that has reached $99.3 billion in sales around the world, according to market researcher Newzoo.\nGallagher noted that just two decades ago, video games were a niche. Now games are an economic driver, he said, with $23.5 billion in the U.S. in 2015 sales across physical and digital segments. And they remain an innovative force in technology, too — just look at how games could be the killer app for virtual reality. The U.S. has 1,800 video game facilities (companies and offices), with more than 1,600 publishers and developers. And 406 universities have degrees or curricula in video games.\nPeter Phillips, the executive vice president and general manager of interactive and digital distribution for Disney’s Marvel Entertainment. He oversees Marvel’s New York digital media division, which creates and manages web, app, and social media experiences. He also runs the Los Angeles video games unit, which oversees the development of multiplatform games, and the L.A. digital film and video distribution group.\nBasically, he licenses game publishers and developers to make games based on Marvel properties, and that responsibility is a serious one. When he spoke at our event last year, he viewed the role as a “brand steward,” or being a caretaker who was very careful about what he allowed others to do with Marvel brands. We’re delighted to have him back for a fireside chat at a time just before the May 6 debut of Captain America: Civil War in theaters.\nRobbie Bach, the former chief Xbox officer. Microsoft lost $5-7 billion on the original Xbox, launched in 2001. And it made billions of dollars on the Xbox 360. Depending on the time frame in which you look at it, this was either an insane waste of money or the finest strategic decision that Microsoft ever made.  Robbie Bach had to make the call to do it or not. He was the chief Xbox officer from 2000 to 2010. After two console cycles, Bach decided to do work as a “civic engineer” to help fix both charities and governments. We look forward to a discussion of what Bach learned from his efforts and how they are relevant today to companies that are trying to establish new platforms. Bach recently wrote a memoir book, Xbox Revisited , about his time at Microsoft and his own efforts to fix our country’s civic problems.\nRami Ismail, the cofounder of Vlambeer. Ismail is one of the most  visible independent game developers  in the world. The cofounder of the Netherlands-based Vlambeer  is trying to use that fame to give back to the indie community and do good. The studio’s has a signature style, and fans have supported it all the way. Five years ago, Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman started the company. Their hits include Super Crate Box (2010), Serious Sam: The Random Encounter (2011), Gun Godz (2012), Ridiculous Fishing (2013), Luftrausers (2014), and Nuclear Throne (2014). Ismail has also been active supporting indies with the Indie Press Kit ,  DoDistribute , DoToolKit , and  GameDev world . Ismail is outspoken on social issues, and he has taken gamers to task for online harassment. And he remains a big advocate for the global gaming business.\nNoah Falstein, the chief game designer at Google. Falstein has had a long history of making video games. But at Google, which doesn’t make traditional video games, you would think that he doesn’t have much to do. But he does. Falstein noted in a panel that I moderated last year that  Google supports games across the whole spectrum, perhaps more so than any other company. Much of its focus is in getting the next billion people to play games on such platforms as Android devices and virtual reality.\nAt last year’s Game Developers Conference, Falstein talked about doing games using Google’s Project Tango, the augmented reality technology that can map the 3D space around you and, using a tablet screen or future augmented reality glasses, project an interactive experience into that space. You can conceivably play a 3D horror game inside your own house where you hide behind your own furniture to escape a monster. Falstein has also talked about creating games such as the massively multiplayer online mobile game, Ingress, which was recently spun out of Google as Niantic. Falstein has served in game design roles at the Inspiracy, Suddenly Social, NF Interactive, LucasArts, Dreamworks, and 3DO.\nNeil Young, the CEO of N3twork. Young and Bob Stevenson launched N3twork as a social network based on interests groups in 2013. It didn’t take off as expected, so they pivoted last fall into mobile gaming. That was an unusual move, but it showed how flexible Young was in adapting to the fast-changing market. And, if anything, gaming has been changing fast in the past few years. It won’t be an easy path as big companies are starting to dominate the top-grossing games in mobile. But Young has pulled off some interesting feats in the past. In 2008, he started Ngmoco with Stevenson at the dawn of the iPhone era. Japan’s DeNA, a mobile and social gaming company, acquired Ngmoco for $400 million in 2010. Before that, Young spent years working on triple-A games such as The Lord of the Rings, The Sims, and the experimental Majestic game at Electronic Arts. He built his first game when he was 14.\nSome of our topics include:\nMonetization: Where mobile game monetization meets marketing and retention\nYou cannot monetize efficiently without first having an engaged audience. This discussion will host an open round table of mobile experts to dive into crafting the perfect balance between monetization, retention and marketing, creating a game funnel that generates revenue.\nDeals: Follow the money\nThe conventional wisdom says that it’s smarter to invest in the emerging markets of augmented reality and virtual reality than in mobile games. But FunPlus recently announced a $50 million fund to invest primarily in mobile games. The overall surge of investment dollars into private gaming companies has been followed by a slowdown in recent months. Will this snail’s pace continue, or will we see certain segments start the upward cycle again?\nAd fraud: How to deal with it\nThere’s a dirty secret in mobile gaming when it comes to acquiring users. You have to be able to detect fraud to be able to make sure that you’re really monetizing the way you think you are.\nIs the gaming world flat?\nWhat are the ingredients necessary to turn a region into a hub for great game development? That’s a good question, and it’s an economic gold mine for any region that figures it out since games have become a $90 billion industry, according to tech advisor Digi-Capital.\nDisclosure and choice: How we can manage “crunch”\nSince its emergence, the game industry has always had a problem of extreme work hours that came to be accepted as “normal”. These extended periods of “crunch time”, wherein developers are expected to go work far beyond standard hours to make up for the company’s inability to effectively manage a project and/or manage creative expectations for a given time frame. While crunch is a reality of most every creative medium, there is a better way to manage its infliction on employees, primarily by instituting a policy of upfront disclosure and enabling employees to choose the kind of conditions in which they will create.\nThe evolution of engagement\nEngagement has meant very different things for mobile gaming ads over time, and we’ll examine how to retain the attention of mobile gamers with ads today.\nOur event advisory board includes:\nSinjin Bain, CEO of MaxPlay\nGordon Bellamy, visiting scholar at USC\nSeamus Blackley, Xbox cofounder and consultant\nMichael Chang, senior vice president of corporate development at NCSoft\nDaniel Cho, chairman at Innospark\nKate Edwards, executive director at the International Game Developers Association\nJay Eum, managing director of TransLink Capital\n", "deleted" : false }

And of course, an even larger number of legitimate URLs that have been hacked and carry out the same function are operating at the same time.\nThen you have popular social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, which attackers are using to trick people into visiting their sites via various methods of technical and social engineering.\nAs far as dangerous things go, over 17,000 new malware threats are appearing per day and some 5.5 million pieces of malware were identified last year alone, the report claims.\n\"The stealth of malware in the age of Web 2.0 is precisely what makes it so dangerous; while users remain blissfully unaware of its presence, the malware can install key loggers, steal passwords, and send critical information directly from the end-user PC to a remote host,\" Purewire researchers said.\nPhishing and different forms of cross-site scripting continue to proliferate at a rapid and exponential rate of growth as well.\nThen you have the people, with trust relationships, particularly those maintained over Web 2.0 platforms, making it easier for the bad guys to find their prey and target the right content at them.\n\"Web 2.0 is centered on user-generated content and user-based commerce. There are unknown people posting and sending the content and unknown people behind the transactions. That said, the more you know about a user, the better decisions you can make around interacting in this environment,\" the experts point out.\nWith the continued spread of the cyber-crime and malware epidemic using techniques that target browsers, organizations need to reconsider the types of security tools that they use, Purewire submits in making its points.\nHowever, if the company's answer to many of these current problems lies in the use of hosted online security services, one has to stop and question how issues of browser security must certainly impact that model as well.\nFollow eWeek Security Watch on Twitter at: eWeekSecWatch.

And, while it’s true that Microsoft hasn’t announced any deals, by the company’s own admission, it has actually purchased about 15 companies over the last year. The names of most of them haven’t been disclosed, but we can confirm that Microsoft did purchase the virtual world Vivaty this summer.\nAdvertisement\nVivaty, a 3D virtual world that had raised more than $9.4 million in backing from investors including Kleiner Perkins, shut down in April, saying it was out of money. At the time, Founder Keith McCurdy, a former VP at Electronic Arts (NSDQ: ERTS), told told VentureBeat that the company was in the final stages of being sold and that its IP would be used “as the foundation for something else.” The buyer was Microsoft, McCurdy tells us in an e-mail.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s not clear why Microsoft bought Vivaty and McCurdy wouldn’t say. But Microsoft seems to have a specific interest in gaming companies. ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley reported this week that Microsoft was making “overtures” to various social gaming companies, including possibly Second Life parent Linden Lab. (A commenter on her post mentioned that Microsoft had quietly purchased Vivaty, prompting me to check.)\nAdvertisement\nVirtual worlds are an odd category for Microsoft to be interested in, considering that the business seems to be falling out of favor with both investors and users, and several, including Metaplace, Vivaty and There.com, have shut down in recent months. Even Linden Lab is said to be struggling. CEO Mark Kingdon resigned in June , a few weeks after the company cut 30 percent of its staff.\nAdvertisement\nBy contrast, social games are taking off and, indeed, Microsoft was in talks to buy Happy Aquarium developer CrowdStar earlier this year. Those talks fell apart in late March.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s possible that a virtual world of some sort could be folded into Microsoft’s popular Xbox Live service a la PlayStation Home. Or, possibly, it could bulk up Microsoft’s MSN Games portal, which has slipped in popularity over the last year.\nAdvertisement\nSo why didn’t Microsoft just announce the Vivaty deal? We’re still awaiting a response from the company. But it seems as though Microsoft has made a strategic decision to keep many of its recent purchases hush-hush. That’s a contrast to Google (NSDQ: GOOG), which seems to announce all of its acquisitions no matter how small and has gained the reputation for being extremely loose with its checkbook. Maybe Microsoft wants to present itself as being more careful with investors’ money, a desire which is apparent in some of the company’s other recent moves as well.\nAdvertisement\nMicrosoft Managing Director of corporate development Marc Brown said at a conference this week that his company had made about 15 acquisitions over the last 12 months, all for under $75 million, according to a report in TechFlash. Microsoft announced five purchases between September and December of last year and including Vivaty makes six. But none of the other names have leaked. Feel free to share those names with us if you know.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nTags\n", "deleted" : false }

Kim Zetter Security\nDate of Publication: 08.06.14.\nTime of Publication: 4:28 pm.\n4:28 pm\nCIA Insider: U.S. Should Buy All Security Exploits, Then Disclose Them\nGetty\nLAS VEGAS — To increase the security of the internet and computers, the government should corner the market on zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits, offering top-dollar to force out all other buyers. At least, that’s what Dan Geer thinks, and his opinion matters. Geer is chief information security officer at the CIA’s venture capital arm In-Q-Tel , which invests in technologies that help the intelligence community.\nGeer, an icon in the world of computer security, delivered his controversial stance during a keynote at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas today. His talk, entitled “Cybersecurity as Realpolitik” was provocative throughout, including advocating that software companies make their unsupported products open source to keep them secure. He even quoted the Code of Hammurabi (circa 1700 B.C.) while suggesting that product liability be applied to source code. “If a builder builds a house for someone, and does not construct it properly, and the house which he built falls in and kills its owner, then the builder shall be put to death,” he said. While the death penalty may be a little severe for software makers who fail to adequately secure their products, criminal and civil liability isn’t, he suggests.\nDan Geer.\nMark Bristow via The Open Web Application Security Project\nBut the highlight of Geer’s talk was definitely his suggestion that the U.S. government own the zero-day market. Zero-day vulnerabilities are security holes in software that are yet unknown to software makers or to antivirus firms. They’re unpatched and unprotected, leaving them open to exploit by spy agencies, criminal hackers, and others. Once the government purchases zero-days, he said, it should burn them by disclosing them. Showing all of these zero-days to the software makers so that they can be fixed would produce a dual benefit: Not only would it improve security, but it would burn our enemies’ stockpiles of exploits and vulnerabilities, making the U.S. far less susceptible to cyberattacks.\nHe said that paying big for zero days would improve security because it would allow hunting for vulnerabilities to be profitable without being destructive. “Once vulnerability finding became a job and not a hobby, those finding vulnerabilities stopped sharing,” he said. “When bug hunters find bugs just for fun and fame, they share the information immediately because they don’t want someone else to find it and take credit for it.” But those doing it for profit don’t share and don’t care. He proposes that the U.S. government openly corner the world market on vulnerabilities. Under such a program, the government would say, “show us a competing bid, and we’ll give you 10 times.”\nThese comments are not likely to win Geer friends at the NSA or CIA; both agencies rely on the U.S. government’s own massive stockpile of secret zero-days to exploit and attack the systems of enemies and surveillance targets. That shouldn’t bother Geer, who is used to making his bosses angry. In 2003, he co-authored a provocative and groundbreaking paper titled “CyberInsecurity: The Cost of Monopoly,” which argued that the dominance and ubiquity of Microsoft’s operating systems was a threat to national security. He was subsequently fired by his employer @Stake over the paper. His firm was a supplier to Microsoft.\nGeer acknowledges that there will be some who refuse to sell to the U.S. government on principle, no matter the price. But under his plan, anyone who refuses to sell to the U.S. has to live with the reality that the vulnerability will likely be discovered by someone else who will be willing. This plan should encourage the holdouts to eventually become vendors to the U.S. as well.\nAnd when that happens, the U.S. can drastically lower the impact of international cyberwarfare. “We don’t need intelligence on what weapons our adversaries have if we have something close to a complete inventory of the world’s vulns and have shared that with all the affected software suppliers.”\n", "deleted" : false }

Have an affair.’ – including for U.S. government officials, UK civil servants and high-level executives at European and North America corporations.\nThe U.S Defence Department and Postal Service are also investigating the alleged use of military and other government email accounts on the site.\nFormer reality TV star and family values campaigner Josh Duggar admitting to cheating on his wife after reports he had subscribed to the site.\nThe hackers object to the site’s business practices, specifically a “paid delete” option that allows people to pay to remove all their information but, they say, does not actually do that.\nDavid Kennedy, founder and security consultant at TrustedSec, said that the fresh release appears to be authentic. “Everything appears to be legit,” he said in an email. “We have portions downloaded and its confirmed legitimate thus far.”\nA report in Vice Media’s online technology site Motherboard, which first reported the new data dump, said the release bore the same fingerprints as Tuesday’s release.\nThe additional release will likely ratchet up the pressure on Avid Life, which has been quiet about exactly how much and what sort of data was stolen in a breach in July.\nThe company, which also owns websites CougarLife.com and EstablishedMen.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “These guys are very diligent about not being caught,” said Erik Cabetas, managing partner of Include Security, who has done forensic work on the initial dump.\nThe release includes source code for the website as well as smartphone apps and proprietary company data, he added. The availability of the source code could allow other hackers to set up a similar site or find and exploit vulnerabilities on the actual site, which is still operating.\nThe 20-gigabyte data dump reported on Thursday would be roughly double the size of the earlier one.\nDespite the negative publicity surrounding the cyber attack, demand for Ashley Madison’s services has been steady since the data breach first announced in July, said Mark Brooks, CEO of Internet dating consultancy Courtland Brooks.\n“I would have thought this would be a death knell for that company because their entire business basis is privacy,” Brooks said. “It just goes to say that all press is good press…The awareness of the brand is through the roof.”\nU.S. MILITARY, POSTAL SERVICE PROBES\nThe data release could have severe consequences for U.S. service members. Several tech websites reported that more than 15,000 email addresses were government and military ones.\nThe Pentagon said it was aware of reports that military email addresses were among those posted earlier in the week. Defence Secretary Ash Carter told a Pentagon news conference that different service branches were looking into the matter.\n“I’m aware of it. Of course it’s an issue because conduct is very important. We expect good conduct on the part of our people,” Carter said. “The services are looking into it, as well they should be, absolutely.”\nThe U.S. Postal Service and its internal watchdog also plan to review whether or not some of the agency’s employees may have violated federal policies by using their government email on the infidelity website.\nReuters\n", "deleted" : false }

In the last year, new hacks that use social engineering tactics, authentic-looking \"market surveys\" on phones - and even gift items that arrive in the mail - are all intended to deceive and annoy.\nWorse, some new hacks use the computer as a surveillance system - to find out when you are not at home. Be wary of these 9 emerging exploits from hackers wanting to get at your home.\n1. Free gift card in the mail\nWhen something arrives in the post, it automatically gets a stamp of approval -- literally. But be on guard, says Chris Faulkner, the CEO at Constellate : hackers are increasingly sending out documents such as a a jury summons, or gift cards that say you just need to visit a website and enter your credit card details.\n2. Fake delivery drivers\nIs there a way to be sure a delivery driver is really there to pick up your packages? Matt Sarrel, a security expert with Allbusiness.com , says you must ask to see photo ID. He says hackers have also posed as cable and broadband installers who install a keylogger on your PC and then leave suddenly.\n3. Free USB keydrive or CD-ROM in the mail\nAnother new tactic is for hackers to send a free USB keydrive or CD in the mail or leave one laying around with authentic-looking corporate markings. Ryan Meyer, president at Meyer Technology Group , says the device uses autorun to install a virus, keylogger, spycam, or spyware software - even though the drive itself appears to be faulty.\n4. Intercepting voice calls\nAnother new tactic is to intercept voice phone calls, says Sarrel. Hackers build a homemade hacking device with parts purchased online that cost about $2,500. The hacker records what you say, then blackmail you or use the information for personal gain.\n5. Social engineering by stealing your email\nSarrel says another common tactic is for hackers to steal your email password, usually by guessing based on your birthday or a child's name, and then find out when you are not home to rob you, sd well as determine if there is any information they can use for blackmail, or other private data.\n6. Garage door openers that do not use encryption\nThis one is more common than you think, Many garage door openers do not use any encryption on the wireless signal, which means hackers can use the same make and model to program it to open your garage.\n7. Bluetooth sniper rifle\nA few years ago, John Hering, the CEO at Lookout , demonstrated a Bluetooth sniper rifle that can be used to tap into smartphones in a home, even from a few streets away. According to Hering, these remote devices are becoming more common as a hacking tool since the criminal stays a distance away, but they are easy to build and can penetrate through walls and windows.\n8. Facebook survey ploys\nHackers are now also using a new tactic related to Facebook. Posing as a job hunter or someone doing a survey, they contact you through chat or email and ask you a few innocuous questions. At the very end, they ask a killer question, such as getting hold of your National Insurance/social security number.\n9. Laptop webcam records video\nAs reported by CNET earlier this year , the LANRev program is a common tool hackers use to record remote streams from a webcam. The truly heinous aspect: criminals are able to find out when you are normally not home and rob you.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiked this?

The first part of the effort is Congress Tracker , which is naturally timed for the upcoming midterm elections. The channel is meant to serve as a complement to the original reporting at U.S. News, Loud3r CEO Lowell Goss said in an interview with paidContent. “Users’ expectation in the internet age is for breadth and depth, and the traditional news organ needs to apply technology to get there because there are some tasks that are impossible for a human staff to cover,” Goss said. “The world expects every possible article that there might be on a particular news item. And we can support that with our system.”\nCongress Tracker will serve as a template for future channels, Goss said, but he declined to provide details about what else is in the works. He did say that the next channels would play to U.S. News’ strengths. So it’s reasonable to assume that there will likely be a business, health and education news tracker in near future.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the tasks that Congress Tracker can perform that would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for a magazine’s staff is the promise to have updated profiles of all 435 members of Congress. It will also feature an up-to-the-minute news feed covering hotly debated political issues.\nAdvertisement\nUnlike its erstwhile rivals Time and Newsweek, U.S. News has been more willing to play with the conventions of news magazine production. Two years ago, the magazine moved from weekly to bi-weekly format. Then a few months later, at the end of 2008, the magazine became a monthly.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

I Like Dopplr Better.\nPosted\nAustralia’s ‘Agora’ Android phone gets agoraphobia, delayed indefinitely\nAirline group Air France-KLM , formed after the merger of Société Air France and the Royal Dutch Airlines and currently the largest airline company in the world in terms of operating revenues, has recently launched a social network for travelers called Bluenity to connect its +75 million customers when traveling (presumably so that they can meet up with strangers).\nAn airline moving into social networking is interesting, so we decided to take a look and see how it compares to internet startups who are looking to monetize social platforms catered to travelers. Unfortunately, in this case, it turns out to be not much more than a marketing exercise.\nIn terms of features, Bluenity doesn’t bring anything new to the table, but you’ll find all the necessary basics: you can edit both your leisure and business profile and you get to share your regular departure airport, favorite destinations, number of flights you take per year, and countries you’ve visited in the past. Bluenity lets users interact with other members, connects to their Facebook profile and enables users to share travel tips with each other. I think they would have been better off integrating tips and reviews from other travel communities that have been around for years and offer valuable content in abundance (e.g. TripAdvisor ) and letting you choose which profile (e.g. LinkedIn) you would like to point to.\nI also suspect they will moderate the hell out of the service because their Traveler Charter reads “the Bluenity community encourages travelers to choose good humor over conflict and positive advice over negative criticism. Optimism and enthusiasm are essential to maintaining a friendly atmosphere.” So honesty is fine, just be positive when you’re being critical. Right.\n(Stowe Boyd even had his profile picture rejected because it was pixelated.)\nI still like Dopplr better (other comparable services include TripIt , TravelMuse , TripSay and more), because it doesn’t make a distinction about which airline you’ve chosen to travel with—if you were in doubt, Bluenity only lets you share trips that includes one of Air France-KLM’s flights—and are open to include relevant information and multimedia content from third-party sources (e.g. photos from Flickr) rather than keeping the network a walled garden. Another major advantage to using something like Dopplr instead, is that the service leverages your existing relationship rather than trying to get you to hook up with total strangers.\nWhat’s odd about Bluenity is that it displays travel tips and comments about hotels, restaurants, and attractions in all the languages the service is available in: French, Dutch and English, even when you indicate in which language you would like to browse the social network.\nLast but not least, I think it’s a shame that they decided to boast about being the very first airline to launch a social platform for travelers, when that is clearly not the truth (cases in point: British Airways has Metrotwin while Lufthansa operates both GenerationFly and GenFlyLounge ).\nTo conclude: I think there’s value in airlines engaging their customers in a more social way, as long as they realize that people are generally not loyal to either one airline company nor to a single social network. But it would be better for airlines to launch platforms that are open, or plug into existing communities by partnering with social networking services who have been doing a great job at building and maintaining groups of travelers for years now. Otherwise the barriers to adoption are just too great. Would you want to be friends with the people sitting next to you on a plane? No, you want to get away from those people as soon as the plane lands.\n", "deleted" : false }

And creators and serial entrepreneurs Brian Wiegand and Mark McGuire have had several successes in the start-up world, with the most recent, Alice.com , set to launch this March.

But truth be told, computer viruses have a long and storied history, both on the PC and Apple side of the equation.\nTo be fair, most of the earlier computer viruses weren’t terribly dangerous. If anything, they were more often than not proof-of-concept type of exploits rather than anything malicious.\nDon’t Miss: No one is safe: All 4 major web browsers hacked at Pwn2Own\nTaking an interesting step back through time, Priceonomics recently  took a close look at two of the first computer viruses to ever be released in the wild, Elk Cloner and Brain.\nElk Cloner was the first Apple virus to ever be developed, by a teenager in 1981 no less. The man behind Elk Cloner, not a terribly malicious piece of software, was a 9th grader named Rich Skrenta. These days, Skrenta is the CEO of a search company named Blekko that has already received millions in venture capital funding.\nBrain, meanwhile, was developed in 1986 by two Pakistani brothers – Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi — intent on keeping their software out of the hands of software pirates.\nThe founders of Brain Computer Services, the Alvi brothers say they developed the Brain virus to punish and track piracy of their medical software for the IBM PC. If the disk the program was on was bootlegged, the boot sector was replaced with an infected boot sector, squatting on precious kilobytes of memory, slowing down the disk and sometimes preventing the user from saving. Like Elk Cloner, it was mostly a harmless annoyance, and it didn’t destroy any data. But the infected boot sector also included an ominous message:\n“Welcome to the Dungeon (c) 1986 Basit &amp; Amjad (pvt) Ltd.

In the first half of 2015, this figure amounted to 204,300 units. Affected by lower oil prices, the sales volume of electric vehicles in Japan and the United States declined while that in China and Europe maintained faster growth.\nIn 2014, the global demand for Li-ion power battery for electric vehicles came to 9.8GWh, up 87% from a year earlier, of which the demand from passenger vehicles totaled 7.3GWh and commercial vehicles 2.5GWh. In H1 2015, the global demand for EV Li-ion power battery hit 7GWh, maintaining high growth\nThere are mainly three technology roadmaps for power battery worldwide.\n(1) Ternary materials-based. This mainly takes NCA and NCM as cathode materials. NCM-based batteries have high energy density. With a sustained growth of electric vehicles, the procurement costs of the batteries have in recent years declined dramatically, which has gradually made them a mainstream battery technology for electric vehicles. After 2014, domestic battery companies represented by Samsung SDI, SKI, Tianjin Lishen, and Boston-Power have also shifted their focus to NCM-based batteries. NCA adopts 18650-type battery, which is mainly used in Tesla and Toyota RAV4. It has the highest energy density so far. But because of poor safety performance, the advanced BMS is needed to monitor the operating condition of the battery. Thus, the battery has not been widely used. The typical enterprise is Panasonic.\n(2) LFP-based. Canada and the United States were the first to develop power battery technology, with main patent owners including the U.S. Valence, A123 and University of Texas, and the Canadian Phostech and Hydro-Quebec. In China, by contrast, LFP, the mainstream technology in power lithium battery, is widely used in passenger vehicles and buses, with the typical companies including BYD and Guoxuan High-tech. However, due to the factors like low specific energy and poor low-temperature starting performance, LFP-based batteries are not made available worldwide. The Chinese heavyweight passenger vehicles launched in 2014H2-2015, such as BAIC EV200, Zhidou, Zotye Yun 100, Kandi K10/K11, and JAC iEV5, have begun to use ternary or hybrid ternary batteries-based batteries. The largest LFP-based battery manufacturer, BYD also announced that its new model \"Song\" will be equipped with its own ternary lithium battery. But due to low costs and strong cycle performance, LFP still will be used in electric commercial vehicles as the preferred battery technology for a long period of time. This is particularly true in China. In 2015, battery electric buses showed explosive growth, which would drive a surge in demand for LFP-based batteries.\n(3) Manganese series. It mainly takes LMO as the cathode materials, but LMO is generally modified and is combined with a little bit of NCM or LNO to increase battery energy density. The major typical manufacturers include LGC, AESC, LEJ, etc. And in China, they are MGL, Do-Fluoride Chemicals Co., etc. Manganese series battery is also one of the mainstream technology roadmaps for electric vehicles globally.\nAt present, manganese-series power battery, including NCM and LMO, occupies the mainstream status on a global scale, with the cost of battery packs generally standing at USD400-550/kWh, which reflects an obvious decline since 2014. The cylindrical NCA 18650 battery produced through coiling, though lower costs for its cells, is popular with automakers due to high BMS costs and safety; Similarly, because of poor comprehensive performance, low-cost LFP battery is only is used in China and the United States. However, the US automakers have gradually abandoned LFP batteries and turned to ternary materials-based and Mn-series batteries from Japanese and S. Korean companies. When it comes to the development trends in Li-ion power battery technology, passenger vehicles will mainly adopt manganese series and ternary materials-based batteries while commercial vehicles will primarily use LFP batteries and gradually turn to ternary materials-based batteries.\nAt present, no major technological breakthrough has not yet been made in power battery. It is estimated that the drop in prices for power battery mainly resulted from a fall in the costs of raw materials and economies of scale, but with a limited decline.\nIn 2014, China's power battery shipments totaled 3.7GWH, up 470% from a year earlier. Among them, the demand for passenger vehicle power batteries was 1.6GWh and that for commercial vehicles 2.1GWh. In H1 2015, China's power battery shipments came to 2.72GWh. As battery electric buses showed explosive growth in the second half of 2015, and if we calculate the new energy vehicle output based on 250,000 units for the full year, the corresponding battery demand will reach 11 GWh.\nAs far as Chinese Li-ion power battery manufacturers are concerned, in H1 2015, any of such companies as BYD, Guoxuan, ATL, Tianjin Lishen, OptimumNano, Boston Power, and Pride Battery has a battery output of 100MWH. The shipments of 13 major battery manufacturers accounted for an aggregate 71% in market share, of which BYD had the largest market share of 17%.\nFrom the perspective of global trends, the support from big carmakers is vital to power battery manufacturers. Traditional consumer electronics companies are aggressively conducting transformation. On the other hand, battery materials manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers have also begun to enter this field through various ways. Thus, the first echelon represented by BYD, Guoxuan, Tianjin Lishen, and ATL and the second echelon including OptimumNano, Boston Power, and Pride Battery, BESK, Do-Fluoride Chemicals, CALB, and Shenzhen BAK have taken shape.\nGlobal and China Li-ion Power Battery Industry Report, 2016-2020 by ResearchInChina mainly covers the followings:\nAnalysis of industry chain, including the key materials, cells, Pack & BMS, etc.;\nAnalysis of technology roadmap of Li-ion power battery, including costs, performance, and development directions, etc.;\nAnalysis of global and Chinese electrical vehicle industry, including the industry overview, overseas markets, model output and sales volume, and performance parameter, etc.;\nAnalysis of global and Chinese Li-ion power battery industry, including shipment, market size, price, supply relationship, etc.;\nOperation, technology, development plan, production & marketing of 9 overseas lithium battery manufacturers, mainly from Korea, Japan and USA;\nOperation, technology, development plan, production & marketing of 10 Chinese Li-ion power battery manufacturers.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03435679-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

The report covers the Americas, APAC, and EMEA; it also covers the market landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nThe increased demand for Li-ion batteries is driving manufacturers to develop next-generation technology batteries for electronic devices and vehicles. The Li-ion battery market is gradually shifting to high-energy silicon electrodes in place of conventional graphite ones. The new type of silicon electrode-based Li-ion batteries offer long-lasting energy for laptops and EVs. However, these batteries may also shrink and swell while in use or recharging, resulting in breakdown.\nAccording to the report, the cost of Li-ion batteries is decreasing rapidly owing to an increase in end-user application base. The cost of these batteries was four to eight times more than that of lead-acid batteries and one to four times more than Ni-MH batteries in 2010.\nHowever, the cost has decreased significantly since then, driven by the growing use of Li-ion batteries in BEVs, PHEVs, HEVs, uninterrupted power supply (UPS) systems, forklifts, consumer electronics devices, and backup power supplies. Manufacturers will increasingly be able to leverage economies of scale with growth in market size and production scales.\nKey vendors\n", "deleted" : false }

They will do anything it takes to make it happen. Their attitude is in stark contrast some of the issues they face. Sometimes, when you look at the dire economies and the regulations European entrepreneurs have to deal with, you would forgive them for moving entirely to another part of the planet. Not only two they generally have to deal with less access to funding than their US counterparts, but also the EU commission looking over their shoulders with continual changes to Cookie and privacy laws. But increasingly they are waking up to the fact that they may just be at the start of a journey which sees them develop not just economic power but gradually, political influence.\nAs one founder put it to me on a bus ride to a meeting at the British Embassy in Tel Aviv – where the 50 founders as part of the ICE Group were to meet the Israeli startup community and the British Ambassador “I’m going to spend the next year travelling the globe, and then I will make my decision on where to start up.” That means government realising they will have to woo this new economic class, or rick missing out on the high growth companies of the future.\nThat attitude is endemic in this group of people.\nWith its combination of mailing list and real-world trips to form bonds between its member entrepreneurs, ICE – the slightly tongue-in-cheek named International Conclave of Entrepreneurs – is drawn from a mostly London-based founders, but has increasingly spread its network to Europe and the US. Founded by Alex Hoye (CEO, Latitude Digital), Joshua March (CEO, Conversocial), Peter Ward (CEO WAYN), Kieran O’Neil (Co-founder Playfire) and Andrew Scott (The Taploid), the group was born in 2009 out of simple informal vacations with fellow entrepreneurs. The group stays within the Dunbar number of 150 – the ideal number for a group to retain strong social bonds.\nSince then ICE has been a highly curated member-only network.\nBut something changed this year when the group decided to take a delegation to Tel Aviv to meet both the startup community there (mainly at the DLD Tel Aviv conference) and officialdom. But what started out as informal networking sessions ended with the the group being presented to the British Amabassador and Israel’s President, Shimon Peres.\nIt’s at this point the game changes from simple business networking to something else entirely.\nThis is further evidence that entrepreneurs in Europe are not longer of a mind to simply stand on the sidelines and watch as their governments legislate without their input.\nOut of much of Europe, the UK government has been perhaps the most proactive on this score, creating a Tech City body in London which, despite it’s PR brief, has often turned out to be a Trojan Horse for new legislative ideas around startups and, more recently, moves to create a new stock exchange listing mechanism.\nOver in Berlin, the German government recently woke up to the rapidly growing ecosystem on its doorstep, with the Economics and Technology Minister Philipp Rösler recently being presented with a ‘Berlin startup manifesto‘ aimed at persuading the federal government to drop tax proposals set to hit innovative young companies hard.\nAlmost at the same time in France, the Hollande government has been battling a wave of entrepreneurs telling them their new tax proposals will have dire consequences for startups . The jury remains out on the outcome.\nAnd recently, there was good news coming from a less likely place for startups, when Italy’s technocratic government enacted new laws to allow for a new kind of limited company, aimed at startups, and a €200 million fund for startups – this, after much pressure from Italy’s tech startup community.\nAll over Europe, entrepreneurs are gathering, whether it be Founders Forum , the new CEO Dinner initiative, the new Dutch startup collective , the Silicon Milkroundabout hiring frenzy, the London Startupmafia.org , the ‘ Estonian Startup Mafia ‘, and beyond to the Garage Geeks in Israel or the the PEEKs in Ramallah. There’s no way I could list all the groups out there.\nBut slowly, surely they are organising.\nAnd when the Founders conference in Dublin recently convened for the third time, it wasn’t the Irish President and Taoiseach (Prime Minister) they met (that was last year’s edition), but General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe of NATO.\nIndeed, the links forged at the likes of Founders or ICE may be far more powerful than any kind of lobbying – eventually we will see IPOs and ‘mafias’ like the Paypal mafia go on to launch yet more companies. And because the policy makers see for themselves the creativity and success of these entrepreneurs, they go on to shape the legislation to suit (at least one hopes they do). Success, ultimately, can be more powerful than lobbying and government initiatives.\nWhile Bravo TV in the US is poised to air the Silicon Valley reality TV show , the true reality is that entrepreneurs globally, impatient as always to change the world, are starting to work out how to flex their collective muscles, first by simply forming stronger and deeper friendships, and then by taking their ideas to the highest echelons of power.\nAs ICE’s Alex Hoye tells me: “The primary goal for ICE is for founders and to get to know one another to then be there for one another over time, and that has not changed. However, the inspired welcome we received from Israeli founders, investors and government make it clear that the community is global with mutual lessons to share, and we will continue to step up our game to match that.” In fact, next up is an assault on WEF/Davos.\nAnd as Alexia Tsotsis has said time and time again, tech is going mainstream . And mainstream implies influence at the top.\nReality TV shows will come and go, but the actuality is that real entrepreneurs are poised to take the world by storm.\nTrying watching this:\n", "deleted" : false }

It’s not an unreasonable fear considering an estimated 40 to 50% of married couples in the US have divorced.\nBut, anthropologist and human behaviour expert at Indiana University who’s spent decades studying different aspect of love, Helen Fisher says that if you wait about two years before getting married, it could boost your chances of leading a happy, life-long marriage.\n“There was a recent study in which they asked a lot of [dating] people who were living together … why have they not yet married and 67% were terrified of divorce,” Fisher said on Big Think .\n“Terrified of not only the legal and the financial and the economic but the personal and social fall out of divorce.”\nInterestingly, this fear of divorce is actually giving way to healthier marriages, overall, because people are taking more time getting to know each other before tying the knot, Fisher said.\nAnd time is the only one way to reactivate a part of the brain — responsible for logical decision making and planning — that shuts down when you first fall in love with someone new, which can explain the irrational behaviour of two people who are madly in love:\n“One of the problems with early stage intense feelings of romantic love is that it’s part of the oldest part of the brain that become activated — brain regions linked with drive, with craving, with obsession, with motivation,” Fisher, who has studied the brain on love , said. “In fact some cognitive regions up in the prefrontal cortex [shown below] that have evolved more recently begin to shut down — brain regions linked with decision making [and] planning ahead.”\nPublic Domain\nThis intense feeling of love can cloud your ability to think logically or rationally about the person you’re with. Therefore, by allowing time for the brain to adjust to the new situation and feelings you’re experiencing, you can recognise whether who you’re dating is actually right for you.\n“I think … this slow love process of getting to know somebody very carefully over a long period of time is going to help the brain readjust some of these brain regions for decision making,” Fisher said. “You’re going to get to know how this person handles your parents at Christmas … how they handle your friends, how they handle their money, how they handle an argument … etc.”\nUltimately, you want to get a good sense of your partner’s behaviour during these real life situations, which is why Fisher suggests to wait at least two years. That way, you’ve been around the annual treadmill of life twice with your partner, and, therefore, should have a good sense of how they handle themselves under different circumstances.\n“I think people should marry when they feel like marrying but from what I know about the brain if it were me I’d wait at least two years.”\nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn\nTagged In\n", "deleted" : false }

By signing up for all ten, you increase your chances of getting a job and decrease the amount of time you’ll spend searching for a new one. Three of the listed sites can be combined with other sites to be more impactful. In addition to joining, creating profiles and searching for jobs, I encourage you to support these sites with either a traditional website or blog, so that you have more to present to employers, in addition to your profile.\nHave another social network you'd recommend? Tell us more about it in the comments.\n1. LinkedIn\nLinkedIn is by far the #1 spot for job seekers, those currently employed, marketers who are looking to build lists and salespeople who are seeking out new clients. With 35 million users, including recruiters and job seekers, LinkedIn is quite a hot spot. Of course, due to the current state of the economy, it's simple to understand why LinkedIn is more popular than ever.\nThe problem is that most job seekers don’t optimize their profile, cultivate their network, join and participate in groups, use applications and exchange endorsements. That is basically everything you should be doing in a nutshell. I also recommend that you use a distinct URL (linkedin.com/in/yourfullname) and an avatar that best represents you and is consistent with the picture on your other social sites.\nWhen you search for a job, recognize who in your network might help you get to the hiring manager. You’re given 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree connections on LinkedIn that you should be using to secure a job opening.\n2. Plaxo With Simply Hired\nPlaxo is a social network that resembles LinkedIn to a certain degree. You’re able to create your own profile with a section about you, your contact information and your “pulse stream,” which is made up of your presence on social media sites such as Twitter. You’re even able to share your photo album and send eCards, which is a nice differentiator.\nThe real value in Plaxo is the address book that keeps track of all of your contact information, including a Yahoo! Map indicating where your contacts live. Plaxo, which is owned by Comcast, is also integrated with Simply Hired , which is a job aggregator that searches thousands of job sites and companies and aggregates them in a single location for you. After building your Plaxo profile, use it as part of the recruitment process when applying for jobs with Simply Hired for success.\n3. Twitter With Blog or LinkedIn URL\nTwitter is an amazing tool if you can unlock its power. It’s taken me months to understand how conversations flow and how I can add to the discussion. Twitter breaks down communication barriers and lets you talk directly to hiring managers, without having to submit a resume immediately to a machine.\nAlthough Twitter is probably one of the best networking tools on the planet, it needs to be supplemented with a blog or LinkedIn profile. There’s no way you can hire someone based on a Twitter profile, without having a link from that profile to something else that gives more information on that job seeker. You get to add one URL to your profile, so choose wisely.\n4. Jobster\nJobster isn’t spoken about nearly enough, yet it is a powerful platform for networking with employers who are offering jobs, while you’re searching. You can upload your resume, embed your video resume, showcase links to your site, your picture and tag your skills, which is a unique differentiator. You can search for open positions and see who the person is who posted the job. Then you can add them to your network and connect with them to find out more about the position.\n5. Facebook\nFacebook can be used to get jobs. There are two main ways of acquiring a job through Facebook. The first is to go to your Facebook marketplace, which lists job openings or other opportunities in your network. Aside from jobs, there are “items wanted” and a “for sale” listing. When searching for jobs, you’ll be able to see who listed the item and then message them to show your interest.\nWhen you find a job opening that you’re interested in, you’ll be able to message the hiring manager directly. For instance, the subject line of the message will auto-populate with “Principal Web Developer in Littleton, MA” in the subject line. The second way to get a job using Facebook is to join groups and fan pages to find people with common interests and to network with them.\n6. Craigslist\nCraigslist is an extremely valuable job search tool if you’re not looking to work for a big brand name company, such as P&G or GE. Most of the positions on Craigslist are for consultants (design/programming help) and at small to midsize companies that are hiring. There are new listings every day and if you wake up to this site every morning and refresh the page, you have a good chance at getting a job sooner rather than later.\n7. MyWorkster With Indeed\nMyWorkster focuses on exclusive networks for colleges, allowing students and alumni to connect for exclusive career opportunities. This site isn’t valuable to you if you didn’t go to college though. This social network allows you to create a professional profile and network with potential employers.\nFor a free account, you get a profile, instant messenger built in the site, groups, events, your resume and more. The big differentiator is that it uses Facebook Connect to get your information. Here is an example of a profile page. MyWorkster also has job listings, which are provided by Indeed , a job search engine and aggregator, which is very similar to Simply Hired.\n8. VisualCV\nVisualCV understands the importance of personal branding in a job search. Instead of a traditional resume, you get your own branded webpage, where you can add video, audio, images, graphs, charts, work samples, presentations and references. VisualCVs not only let you stand out from the crowd, but communicate your value in a way that’s not possible with static text.\nAfter you’ve created your VisualCV, you can display it publicly or privately, email it to a recruiter, save it as a PDF or forward the URL, which will rank high for your name. On the site, you can search for jobs and apply directly using your VisualCV. Everybody’s favorite venture capitalist, Guy Kawasaki, is on their board.\nDisclosure: VisualCV sponsors my blog and magazine.\n9. JobFox\nJobFox , like online dating, tries to pair you up with a job that best fits you. Their differentiator is their “Mutual Suitability SystemTM” that enables them to match your wants and needs to those of employers to find the best relationship. The system learns about your skills, experiences, and goals and then presents you with jobs.\nThen there’s the “Jobfox Intro,” where both the applicant and company get emails to encourage the connection. Just like VisualCV, you get your own branded website, with a personal web address to send to employers. JobFox was created by Rob McGovern, the founder of Careerbuilder.com.\n10. Ecademy\nEcademy , like LinkedIn, is a prime source for professional networking. You have your own online profile, where you can tell people what you do. You can join business networking groups based around your expertise and exchange messages with other members privately. You can also ask for introductions from friends, just like LinkedIn. Although, there isn’t a job search area on the site, 80% of jobs are from networking and this place is dedicated to it.\nMore Career Resources from Mashable:\n", "deleted" : false }

While much of the press so far has focused on the big technology companies — Google, (s GOOG) Microsoft, (s MSFT) Yahoo (s YHOO) and the like — little attention has been paid to the other potential buyers. Verizon, (s VZ) in particular, seems like a good match for the company, as it has shown a willingness to invest in online video, but not at the expense of its traditional FiOS TV business.\nBusiness interests are aligned\nAdvertisement\nGoogle and others in the tech world are all about innovation and disruption, but that’s not necessarily what ABC, (s DIS) NBC (s CMCSA) and Fox (s NWS) want from a buyer. With Verizon, they’d be getting a partner they’re already doing business with. More importantly, both Verizon and the broadcasters have the same interests, and neither will blindly support growth at Hulu at the expense of live TV viewing or fewer people paying for FiOS.\nAdvertisement\nVerizon, therefore, is less likely to balk at crippling terms in Hulu’s recently renegotiated rights deals. Some reports suggest those deals could extend the time between shows being broadcast and becoming available online by up to a week, rather than being up on Hulu the day after they air.\nAdvertisement\nThere’s also the belief that broadcasters could start tying next-day access to Hulu shows to their cable subscriptions . Many cable networks already use pay TV subscriber logins to authenticate users, in a scheme referred to as TV Everywhere. But the latest talks suggest this TV Everywhere plan could be extended to broadcast TV.\nAdvertisement\nWhile HD over-the-air signals for broadcast TV are free, many broadcasters have begun demanding pay TV operators pay retransmission fees for access to their shows, in the same way they pay per-subscriber fees for cable networks. As a result, those operators might demand  Hulu begin authenticating its users in the same way cable networks do.\nAdvertisement\nGoogle, Amazon, (s AMZN) Yahoo and other tech companies might be opposed to such a requirement, as it could affect viewership on the newly acquired site, but it’s actually in Verizon’s best interests to support such a plan. After all, Verizon wants to sign up as many TV Everywhere users as possible, who could then view content from Epix (s via) (s lgf), HBO, (s TWX) Showtime (s CBS) and other networks that have made their content available through the service.\nAdvertisement\nVerizon is betting big on online video\nAdvertisement\nOne might ask what Verizon actually gets from Hulu. After all, if the telco is fine with certain rights requirements — like longer windows and authentication — that might limit growth and consumer adoption, and one could argue it’s not fully committed to growing the online video company as an independent business. If that’s the case, then why buy it at all?\nAdvertisement\nFor one thing, this type of move isn’t entirely unprecedented. Comcast purchased Fandango back in 2007 and used it for the basis of its Fancast online video portal, which later became Xfinity TV Online . (s CMCSA) And let’s not forget: Verizon is essentially an IPTV play, and has been supporting IP video for years. It has also recently made a number of moves that suggest it could begin getting a lot more aggressive in the online video space in particular. An acquisition of Hulu would merely supplement those already existing initiatives.\nAdvertisement\nTake, for instance, its plan to allow subscribers to purchase video-on-demand titles through the program guide and watch them online or across a number of mobile or connected devices. Or its yet-to-be-released live streaming iPad app  (s aapl). Or its plan to make its streaming VOD service available to users that aren’t even FiOS subscribers , potentially pitting it against iTunes, Amazon Video On Demand and Walmart’s Vudu. (s WMT) These efforts show a willingness to jump into the online video market, and Hulu would be complementary to those services.\nAdvertisement\nThen there’s Verizon’s Digital Media Services initiative. At NAB this year, it was being pitched as a way to simplify the delivery of broadcast video online, while also lowering the cost of distributing to as many devices and platforms as possible. It’s clear Verizon isn’t just thinking about online video to grow its revenues from the traditional TV or VOD perspective, but it’s also looking at its role as part of the broader ecosystem.\nAdvertisement\nNo one else is a good fit\nAdvertisement\nNow that we’ve discussed Verizon’s pros, let’s look at some of the other potential buyers — and why they wouldn’t make such a good fit. Of the aforementioned suitors, there are serious issues with each one:\nAdvertisement\nGoogle is already knee-deep in its own work to transform YouTube into a destination for long-form professional and semi-professional content, and any combination of YouTube and Hulu is likely to face serious regulatory scrutiny.\nAmazon is Hulu CEO Jason Kilar’s former employer, and has invested in an online VOD and subscription video service. But it has shown no interest in ad-supported video, which is Hulu’s bread and butter.\nMicrosoft has never invested heavily in digital media properties and seems unlikely to start now.\nGiven Yahoo‘s recent history of acquisitions, it seems clear to most people that a purchase of Hulu could have disastrous results for the site.\nAdvertisement\nIn other words, there are plenty of reasons why Hulu might not work with some of the larger tech firms. But there are some very good reasons why a distributor like Verizon would want to buy into a startup like Hulu, even if it is potentially disruptive to the traditional TV business. That’s not to say a Verizon-Hulu mashup would be a slam dunk, but if Verizon were really committed to investing in Hulu’s business as a potential new growth engine, it could be an easy lay-up.\nAdvertisement\nPhoto courtesy of (CC BY 2.0) Flickr user Casey Serin .\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nTags\n", "deleted" : false }

Unlike the others, whose services were adapted from the Web site to the WAP site, Bluepulse was born on cell phones , and its engineering team focused solely on designing a simple, useful social network anyone can use on a Web-ready phone.\nNew features\nThree new features keep to the mantras of simplicity and quick broadcasting while also adding convenience. People are now able to import friends' e-mails from Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, and AOL by either cherry-picking friends or importing them all. While there's a way to add friends by searching for their phone number, name, e-mail address, or Bluepulse log-in later on in the process, the new feature begs for a search field to keep the socially promiscuous from thumbing through 20 pages of friends.\nA second new addition takes the form of a daily summary of your activity feed, sent to you via e-mail or SMS if you haven't logged on to Bluepulse for 24 hours. This complements a feature already firmly in place, the optional SMS or e-mail alert you get when you receive, for example, an invite request or message. The friends you've imported via e-mail will receive something similar to this in their in-boxes every time you send them a message via Bluepulse, but don't worry, they can opt out.\nA selection of seven emoticons make up the final addition to Bluepulse's mobile social network. Now people can select \"pixs\" instead of \"text\" to send one of these smilies to anyone in their network. Like IM, I'd like to be able to mix images with words, but CEO Ben Keighran cites technical reasons why Bluepulse is currently holding back.\nMySpace\n\"A lot of browsers can't handle text and pictures,\" he said. An image appended by more than four or five words can break simple mobile browsers , he says, but creating a full-blown emoticon and text set for select phones is definitely an option.\nMySpace Mobile Web\nBluepulse isn't the only social network with a mobile presence to get work done. Earlier this month, MySpace Mobile Web left beta and made its big push as a much richer mobile app than the beta. Plus, deals with Sprint and Verizon make it much easier for people to directly access their MySpace content as a shortcut from the phone's Web portal. MySpace Mobile Web users can update their profiles, post blogs, peruse photos, and send and receive messages from these shortcuts or by pointing the cell phone browser to m.myspace.com .\n", "deleted" : false }

Syndicaster is an online editing and video-clip management service that allows TV stations to any broadcast news clip and repurpose it for the Web by publishing it to their own Websites or through its sister service ClipSyndicate (both Syndicaster and ClipSyndicate are divisions of Critical Media ).\nNow Syndicaster is adding one-click distribution options to the major video sites so that local TV affiliates or station groups can post their videos to AOL Money & Finance or their YouTube channel, and manage it all from one place. One feature that TV customers will appreciate is the ability to set embargo windows for each service, allowing a TV station to publish hot news immediately to its own site, then 24 or 36 hours later to video partner sites where it makes the most money, and then maybe finally to YouTube.\nSyndicaster has also recently added an on-location feature which allows TV reporters and crews to upload clips directly from wherever they are capturing the footage, and making that footage available as Web video clips even if it never gets airtime. Affiliated stations can also go to Syndicaster to find footage and use it either on the Web or on-air, depending on their arrangements with each other. When that airplane crashed in Buffalo, NY recently, a local station put all of its footage on Syndicaster, and other affiliated stations around the country used it to grab video footage for their own on-air reports.\nSyndicaster charges a flat subscription fee of about $850 a month per TV station or news organization. With 60 paying customers, that comes to about $50,000 a month a few months after launch, with a lot of runway for growth. Syndicaster is exploring ways to bring its online editing and video distribution platform to consumers, but so far it is stumped in that area. CEO Sean Morgan admits:\nLook, I don’t know how to make money on the consumer. I’d like to make money on this. We are getting great traction from broadcasters. Bringing it to newspapers is obviously the next path forward.\nIn May, the company plans to expand its reach to newspaper sites with Syndicaster for Newspapers. As news organizations of all stripes make video a bigger component of their online offerings, Syndicaster is hoping to become the industry standard for ingesting, editing, and distributing these videos. Maybe the A.P. should look into it.\n", "deleted" : false }

And unless you have been living under a rock you already know that this time it's a smart watch, a long overdue update to what is essentially 19th century wristwatch technology. There are already a fair number of early players in this new category—in this article we'll examine how well the displays in two second generation smart watches from two top tier manufacturers perform: the Sony SmartWatch 2, with an LCD display, and the Samsung Galaxy Gear 2, with an OLED display.\nSmartwatches are the next revolution in tech gadgets because a watch should be able to tell you a lot more than just the time. Plus, smartphones are now so important and doing so much that they need a readily assessable and conveniently viewable assistant to help out with all that's going on in the smartphone—a smart watch is perfect for this and your wrist is prime coveted real estate. So if you get lots of text messages, emails, appointment and app alerts, or even voice calls, then a smartwatch will be very useful and helpful. It's no surprise that most of the major mobile tech players are expected to compete in this new category, including (alphabetically) Apple, Google, LG, Motorola, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Sony.\nThe display is clearly the most important and key component in a smart watch and most people will expect a smartwatch to have a display with quality comparable to their smartphone.\nThat turns out to be a major challenge for a number of reasons. First, the screen size is only about 1.5 inches, so the display needs a fairly high resolution in pixels per inch in order to provide sharp and easy to read fine text and graphics. It also needs to produce fairly bright images because watches are often viewed in high ambient light. A larger color gamut is also needed to counteract color washout from ambient light, plus vibrant saturated colors are quite helpful when reading screens with text and graphics information. A major challenge is accomplishing all of this with greater than one day of battery running time.\nAdvertisement\nThe software will be updated but the display cannot.\nThe software OS, user interface, and apps for smartwatches are evolving and improving rapidly, so it isn't necessary to wait for completed and polished software before buying one—but the display cannot be updated so select it very carefully. We won't be discussing the software here, just the display. You'll find lots of software and app reviews and articles elsewhere, but we'll provide an in-depth analysis of smart watch displays that you will find nowhere else.\nSmartwatch display technologies\nAlmost all current smartphones use a backlit LCD or an OLED display—both require battery power to generate their light. They will also work in a smartwatch provided the display is on only when you need to look at it—just like a smartphone. That can be done with a manual on button, a touchscreen gesture, or by monitoring the motion and position of the watch and then automatically turning the display On when it is moved to a viewing position. That's how the Samsung Gear 2 OLED display works. Another approach is to use a reflective display, which can use existing ambient light to keep the screen working and visible at all times without a significant power drain—only requiring an internal light in reduced ambient light conditions. Qualcomm's Mirasol color display works that way (although the Color Gamut is subdued). LCDs can also be manufactured with a pure reflective mode (like traditional LCD wrist watches), or with a combination of both a backlit transmission mode and a reflective mode, which is called a Transflective LCD. That's how the Sony SmartWatch 2, Pebble, and Pixel Qi displays work.\nSponsored\nThe Display Shoot-Out\nHere we will test the Sony SmartWatch 2 and the new Samsung Gear 2. In the near future we'll do a Multi-Display Technology Smartwatch Shoot-Out. To examine the performance of the Sony SmartWatch 2 and Samsung Gear 2 displays we ran our in-depth series of Mobile Display Technology Shoot-Out Lab tests and measurements in order to determine how the displays performed. We take display quality very seriously and provide in-depth objective analysis based on detailed laboratory tests and measurements and extensive viewing tests with both test patterns, test images, and test photos.\nOverview of the Samsung Gear 2\nThe Samsung Gear 2 has a 320x320 pixel 1.63 inch RGB Stripe OLED display, touch screen, accelerometer, gyroscope, home button, 2 MP camera, 4GB memory, microphone, speaker, vibrate function, IR LED to act as remote control, heart rate monitor, charging cradle, and Bluetooth communication. The watch is IP67 dust- and water- resistant (up to 30 minutes in one meter of water). It runs under the Tizen OS and works with the Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy SIII, Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Note 2 Smartphones. The user interface is already fairly nice. Samsung provided DisplayMate Technologies with a production unit to test and analyze for this Display Technology Shoot-Out article.\nOverview of the Sony SmartWatch 2\nThe Sony SmartWatch 2 has a much lower resolution 220x176 pixel 1.60 inch Transflective LCD display, touch screen, home button, Ambient Light Sensor, vibrate function, micro USB charge port, NFC and Bluetooth communication. The watch is IP57 dust- and water- resistant (up to 30 minutes in one meter of water). It works with any smartphone running Android 4.0 or later. The user interface is currently quite primitive, but presumably will improve in future updates and upgrades. We purchased this unit retail.\nResults highlights\nIn this Results section we provide Highlights of the comprehensive Lab tests and measurements and extensive visual comparisons using test photos, test images, and test patterns that are covered in the advanced sections. The Lab Tests and Measurements Comparison Table section summarizes the Lab measurements in the following categories: Brightness and Contrast with Ambient Light , Color Gamut with Ambient Light , Screen Reflections , Viewing Angle Variations . You can also skip these highlights and go directly to the Conclusions .\nAdvertisement\nBattery running time\nThe small size and weight required for a watch means the battery power is strictly limited. The big question is how long will any particular smart watch run on battery before needing recharging (from either AC or a supplementary battery pack). That will vary considerably based on how frequently a consumer uses it, and the particular Apps that are selected—for that reason we did not test the battery running time for this article. Because of the wide range of consumer uses, multiple display technologies will be needed for smart watches. Conserving and efficiently using battery power and extending the running time involves a number of different approaches and compromises for the displays on smart watches, which we discuss below.\nDisplay performance specs\nThe Lab Tests and Measurements Comparison Table has a detailed set of display specs and measurements.\nSharpness: A major difference between the two displays is their screen sharpness: the SmartWatch 2 has a 220x176 pixel screen with 176 ppi and 39K total pixels, while the Gear 2 has a 320x320 pixel screen with 278 ppi and 102K total pixels. The SmartWatch 2 screen was visibly coarse and heavily pixelated (even visible in large text) made worse with poor anti-aliasing, plus the small pixel aperture ratio needed for a transflective LCD makes it much more noticeable. On the other hand the Gear 2 OLED RGB Stripe display was very sharp, even with fine text and graphics.\nBrightness: Both displays are fairly bright: the SmartWatch 2 has 495 nits while the Gear 2 has 415 nits in Outdoor mode and 296 nits in Standard mode (Level 5). However, at typical viewing angles (discussed below) the Gear 2 is brighter.\nColor Gamut and Saturation: The Gear 2 has a very wide color gamut, 135 percent of the sRGB / Rec.709 Standard, which I normally don't like, but on a small 1.6 inch screen the additional color saturation is not objectionable, and actually compensates for the reduction in color saturation caused by ambient light. So under typical ambient light viewing conditions the Gear 2 color gamut is close to 100 percent. The SmartWatch 2 has a 91 percent color gamut, but it falls drastically with ambient light, and the screen is monochrome in reflective mode.\nColor Depth: In order to reproduce images well a display needs to be able to display a wide range of intensity levels – most good displays provide 256 intensity levels, which is essential when mixing the red, green and blue primaries to produce all of the necessary on-screen colors. The 256 intensity levels produces 24-bit color. The Gear 2 display has excellent 24-bit color. Sony specs the SmartWatch 2 display at 16-bit color, which has only 32-64 intensity levels, which produces noticeable artifacts in images that have a range of intensities. In a small 1.6 inch display that would normally be fine, but our test images shown below indicate only 16 intensity levels, which is 12-bit color—the lowest I have seen in a very long time, and is simply unsatisfactory as shown next.\nScreenshots\nA good way to evaluate the display and compare the image and picture quality is with screen shots of a number of test patterns and test photos on each display. We have included three below: a DisplayMate test pattern with smooth white, red, green and blue intensity ramps, a NASA spacecraft photo of a Sunset on Mars, and a Sony Xperia demo photo. Note that the images and displays all have varying aspect ratios. The display on the Samsung Gear 2 accurately and nicely reproduced all three images. The display on the Sony SmartWatch 2 produced poor to horrendous versions of the images, with considerable false contouring and related artifacts, which were quite noticeable even on its small 1.6 inch screen, demonstrating some of the display issues that are discussed above and in the Lab Tests and Measurements Comparison Table . While two of these images are challenging, many of Sony's own set of (soft) demo photos had easily noticeable image artifacts. Even if you are not interested in looking at photos on your smart watch (it's nice for quickly showing some family photos) these test images demonstrate important display performance issues.\nReflective Displays\nWhile we are all used to having the time always visible on a mechanical wrist watch, that seems hardly necessary for a smart watch, particularly with motion and gesture sensors to automatically turn on the display when the wrist is moved to a viewing position. The always on reflective displays each involve selective performance compromises such as reduced image contrast, color gamut, viewing angle, resolution, and intensity scale, and slower response time. Using a combination transmissive and reflective LCD seems like a good solution, but it comes with a significant performance penalty in both the backlight transmissive mode and the reflective mode that keeps the always on image visible in moderate ambient light, and in many (but not all) high ambient light situations (see below). It remains to be seen how consumers will respond and decide which compromises are tolerable or necessary, so multiple display technologies will undoubtedly be needed for smart watches..\nPerformance in high ambient light\nSmart watches are likely to be used more often in higher overall ambient light than smartphones, so how the screen visibility and readability are affected by ambient light is extremely important. Ambient light washes out the screen colors and image contrast. There are a number of ways to improve display performance in ambient light: the two best known are increasing the screen brightness and reducing the screen reflectance. Another is to use extra saturated primary colors and dynamic image contrast to counteract the image washout. But high ambient light will at some point overpower all emissive displays like LCDs and OLEDs. One additional important viewing strategy that we all do automatically is to adjust the angle and position of our wrist to improve watch visibility, and if necessary also rotate so the watch is in our shadow. That works quite well in most circumstances, except in places like the beach.\nReflective displays use an entirely different approach by proportionally reflecting the ambient light, so they have a fixed Contrast Ratio (42 for the SmartWatch 2), and in principle are viewable for any level of ambient light, no matter how high. However, one major enemy for all displays, including reflective displays, are mirror (specular) reflections that overlay the display image with distant images that are reflected by the upper layers of the screen. The only solution is again to vary the angles and positions as mentioned above.\nIn its Outdoor mode the Samsung Gear 2 display was readable and usable even in fairly high 40,000 lux outdoor ambient light, but not in direct sunlight. Its strong saturated primary colors also improve high ambient light readability. The Sony SmartWatch 2 display was also very readable at 40,000 lux and above, and even in direct sunlight in its reflective mode. However, for both watches the mirror reflections mentioned above require the display to be carefully oriented to avoid imaged reflections (including possibly your face). See the Brightness and Contrast with Ambient Light and Color Gamut with Ambient Light sections for details.\nPerformance with viewing angle\nAlmost all displays and display technologies look best when viewed straight on with a zero degree viewing angle – and that's how most people try to view their smartphones, tablets, notebooks, monitors, and TVs. However, a watch is attached to your wrist, which can only move in a constrained manner, so most of the time it's easier, more convenient, and more comfortable to hold it at an intermediate viewing angle like 30 degrees. At that viewing angle the Brightness of most LCDs falls by over 55 percent, and the Contrast Ratio falls even more, by over 75 percent, while OLEDs experience only a 20 percent decrease in both. As a result, the SmartWatch 2 LCD display has a drastic performance decrease at typical viewing angles, but the Gear 2 OLED display experiences only a relatively small one. While the SmartWatch 2 is considerably brighter at 0 degrees, the Gear 2 is brighter and has a much higher Contrast Ratio at typical viewing angles. See the Viewing Angle Variations section for details.\nSmartwatch conclusions\nThe performance differences between the displays in these two top tier second generation smart watches are surprisingly quite large. The OLED display on the Samsung Gear 2 performed very well across the board, almost identically to the most recent Galaxy S OLED Smartphones in almost every test measurement and viewing category. It looked and performed like a small version of a high quality OLED smartphone display—including sharpness, high pixels per inch, brightness, color depth, color gamut, viewing angle, in ambient light, and overall image and picture quality. For details see the Lab Tests and Measurements Comparison Table and also the screenshots above.\nOn the other hand, the Transflective LCD display on the Sony SmartWatch 2 was quite disappointing across the board, especially for a second (actually third) generation device. To easily see that examine the mediocre to poor results in the detailed Lab Tests and Measurements Comparison Table and also in the screenshots above. In particular, the coarse and heavily pixelated low resolution and low pixels per inch screen made worse with poor anti-aliasing, the very low color depth, the poor color gamut in ambient light, and also the poor viewing angle performance (because watches are not easily positioned for zero degree viewing). Using a combination transflective LCD comes with a significant performance penalty in both the backlight transmissive mode and the reflective mode that keeps the always on image visible in moderate ambient light and in some but not all high ambient light situations. The choices and compromises made by Sony for the SmartWatch 2 display simply do not work well. The (rumored) upcoming (presumably) LCD smartwatches from LG and Apple will undoubtedly perform considerably better.\nWhat's Next?\nThe early adopters have been enjoying their smart watches for quite some time. The display is clearly the most important and key component in a smart watch, and the current Samsung Gear 2 already has an excellent display. We'll revisit smartwatch displays again soon when the highly anticipated products from Apple, LG, and others arrive. The software OS, user interface, and apps for all smart watches will continue to improve rapidly with downloadable updates. It will be really interesting to see what other display technologies and strategies are introduced for smart watches, the consumer responses to them, and how they will evolve over time. We'll see more reflective, transflective, curved, and bendable smart watch displays in the near future, and also microLED smart watch displays in the not too distant future. There is no doubt that smart watches will be taking over from mechanical wristwatches, and most likely much sooner than most people think.\nDisplay Shoot-Out Comparison Table\nBelow we examine in-depth the displays on the Sony SmartWatch 2 and Samsung Gear 2 smart watches based on objective Lab measurement data and criteria.

A very simple example would be Uber implementing a prompt to order a car whenever you are leaving a bar where you’ve spent more than two hours, if you’re more than a mile from home.\nBut as you can imagine, it can become far more nuanced and layered than that.\nDuring the private beta, Sense360 worked with companies like Walla.by (letting users input their credit cards to determine which will reap the biggest cash-back rewards at various locations) and ChangeCollective (implementing proactive surfacing of the right self-help course at the right moment), along with others such as Happinin’, Tank&Bear, ZipDrug, and RazorGator.\nCofounder Eli Portnoy explained that there are four major hurdles with implementing a system like this.\nThe first is that each sensor comes with its own set of APIs, meaning there is a lot of complexity around getting that data. And then once you have the data you need, you still have to take troves of raw data and turn it into something meaningful.\nSense360 tackles these first two problems by handling all of the data combing on their end. When a customer signs up and asks for various events to be detected, Sense360’s SDK spits out the code necessary to retrieve this exact data on the user without overloading the client with all the data coming from the necessary sensors.\nBut perhaps more compelling is Sense360’s approach to privacy and battery life.\nWhile an app developer like Uber might have a lot of your personal identifying information, Sense360 is never able to pair the data they’re getting from your sensors or location to your identity.\nUsing the Uber car example above, Sense360 knows that an Uber user has gone to a bar on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and seems to be ready to leave, as well as all the other information the sensors provide about that user. But Sense360 has no idea who that user actually is.\nOn the other side, Uber knows that user John Smith has left a bar after two hours there and he’s five miles from home, but they know nothing else about the data his sensors and location have provided all day long.\nThe final big value proposition from Sense360 is battery-life. Historically, trying to combine location data with sensor data has been a serious battery drain, making it hard for app developers to implement this kind of system on their own. But Portnoy says that even if every app on your phone was using the Sense360 SDK, battery drain from the technology would only hit about 5 percent after a full day of use.\nSense360 has raised $2.75 million in funding led by FirstMark Capital, with participation from Founder Collective, Qualcomm, Box Group, Telenav, Avenue A Ventures, Metamorphic Ventures, DoubleM Capital, Michael Kline, Jason Finger and John Hinnegan.\nYou can learn more about the Sense360 technology here .\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Unlike other funds that invest in a large number of startups,    OnRamp Fund’s focus is to help its portfolio companies achieve critical    milestones by working closely with select entrepreneurial teams.\nEntrepreneurs in the incubator will have the opportunity to work with    mentors and advisors who have built successful companies and are    veterans in their industries.

With operations across the    United States, Taiwan, and China, the fund can assist startups that    require cross border operations but lack the resources to do so. The    fund will also connect entrepreneurs with capital providers across the    globe when they are ready for the next round of financing.\n“Ng has successfully built technology companies both in the United    States and Asia, giving investors access to startups in new markets,”    noted David Hirsch, co-founder and general partner of Metamorphic    Ventures. “The Asia-Pacific region is experiencing exciting growth and    as a result, we can expect more and more collaboration on technology and    investments.”\nOne of OnRamp’s portfolio companies is SimplyBridal, a multi-channel    bridal retailer. SimplyBridal uses proprietary advertising technology to    acquire customers through online channels and funnels them to physical    showrooms in the United States.\nAbout OnRamp Fund\nOnRamp Fund is an international incubator that invests in early stage    startups.

We built    ALEX: Financial Wellness to take the ickiness out the equation. ALEX is    private, helpful and will never, ever judge you.”\nBuilt with the same interactive ALEX technology that provides more than    seven million employees with personalized benefits education and    decision support, ALEX: Financial Wellness applies on-task humor with    the principals of behavioral economics to give employees practical,    personalized and confidential guidance that happens to be fun and    engaging.\nUnlike group presentations or one-on-one     meetings with financial advisors, ALEX: Financial     Wellness provides 24/7 guidance in a private setting that lets     employees ask questions and share information they might be     embarrassed to ask and share around other people.\nUnlike videos, websites or printed materials, ALEX: Financial Wellness interacts with every employee one-on-one,     providing empathetic and personalized guidance based on his or her     unique financial situation.\nUnlike all of the above, ALEX:     Financial Wellness makes confusing and intimidating financial topics     surprisingly easy to understand and engaging by making use of     Jellyvision’s deep understanding of behavioral economics and trademark     humor. Additionally ALEX: Financial Wellness helps employees find and     use other tools provided by their employers.\n“The days of pensions may be long gone, but the best employers still    want what’s best for their employees, and this extends to their    financial wellness,” said Jellyvision CEO Amanda Lannert. “Financial    education—boring and complicated but incredibly important—is right up    our alley. And while I’m biased, they just smashed this one out of the    park. The new ALEX: Financial Wellness is every bit as powerful as ALEX:    Choosing Your Plan.”\nIn a recent    study conducted with Harris Poll , Jellyvision found that employees    have a real thirst for financial advice and information from their    employers, but that a sizable percentage of them are embarrassed by    their lack of knowledge in this area. This can make for tricky terrain    for employers, so Jellyvision has also introduced a new eBook in    conjunction with ALEX: Financial Wellness, called The    Ultimate Financial Wellness Communication Playbook .\n“Beyond our track record taking boring and complicated subjects and    making them engaging and simple, there were two key takeaways in the    study that show the urgent need for ALEX: Financial Wellness,” added    Lannert. “First, employees don’t want to get this kind of information    from their employers. Whether that’s a lack of trust in the employer’s    expertise or that ick factor, they’d much rather go through a    third-party. Second, they want the education when and where it’s most    convenient, meaning that it has to be online, not over coffee and bagels    in the conference room.”\nDemos for ALEX: Financial Wellness are available    here . The Ultimate Financial Wellness Communication Playbook is available    here .\nAbout Jellyvision\nJellyvision is an award-winning technology company whose interactive    software talks people through important, complex and potentially    snooze-inducing life decisions - like choosing a healthcare insurance    plan, saving for retirement or managing finances - in simple, fun and    engaging ways. Our recipe: behavioral science, great writing, purposeful    humor, mighty tech and oregano.\nThe company’s SaaS-based employee communication platform ALEX is used by    hundreds of companies with more than 10 million employees in total –    including 70 of the Fortune 500 and 1 in 5 of the country's largest    companies.

Javier Soltero, Acompli\nWhy Technology ‘Plumbers’ Are Turning to ‘Interior Design’\nImage: Just Jefa/Flickr\nI’m a plumber, and have been for most of my career. While I don’t work with wrenches, pipes or PVC saws, I’ve spent the last 15 years building IT infrastructure and management tools for enterprise software companies. Recent plumbing projects include helping to design and build the backend system for Hyperic, a web infrastructure management tool that was eventually acquired by VMware, where I then led application services strategy for three years as a CTO. Whatever the company, I went to work every day, rolled up my sleeves and went under the sink of big backend business systems, replacing old pipes, fixing leaks and installing new lines.\nSo, after spending most of my professional life in the muck of the plumbing of the internet, why did I next choose to build an iPhone app, something one might easily deem the “interior design” of the software world? The answer is that how we all work is changing, and that’s having a tremendous impact on today’s IT department, the main buyer of plumbing equipment. Unprecedented device adoption, the consumerization of IT and the rise of the the cloud are pushing companies to adapt or fall behind. You and I now have the ability to work differently, and increasingly choose our own technology to get that work done. Not only has that changed the landscape, but also how a plumber like me can best help all of us as professionals.\nThe Commoditization of Traditional IT\nJust ten years ago, there was no way that Box or Dropbox could even exist, let alone be two of the hottest tech companies around, each valued in the billions. This isn’t due to any technical limitations — cloud computing existed then, though definitely not at today’s scale — but simply because storage was the exclusive domain of the IT department. A company’s valuable information was stored on a secure box inside its own walls, and the architecture was created and maintained by that company’s IT department: shared Z: drives, SharePoint… you get the picture.\nThings are different today. Take a quick tour of the Box, Dropbox and Google Enterprise websites and you’ll find each adorned with big-name customers, all storing their important, sensitive documents in the cloud. The same thing is happening with other services like email, security and analytics — products like Google Apps, Microsoft Exchange 365, CipherCloud and Tableau have radically reorganized how companies think about their technology infrastructure, and along with that, what IT departments see as their purview.\nAs infrastructure becomes increasingly commoditized, IT departments have transitioned from laying and fixing pipes to helping control the flow of water through them. Control of, and access to, key elements of infrastructure continues to shift to end users. Innovation in this area is abundant, but there’s only so many things IT can handle. I can assure you that no IT manager has ever uttered, “Please give me more platforms to work with!” As a result, users have begun seeking out their own technology solutions, and bringing those into the workplace.\nMake It Beautiful, or Let Somebody Else Do It\nAccompanying this phenomenon is the changing nature of the products we all use every day at work. Clunky old server-based installations are being overtaken by web-based or mobile applications with friendly and intuitive user interfaces, something that has helped accelerate the commoditization of IT. More importantly, adoption of products is now being led by users explicitly choosing products they want to use, as opposed to IT making those choices on their behalf.\nUntil now, the trajectory of traditional IT has been fairly linear – build, install and upgrade as needed for as long as possible, then reluctantly rip, replace and start over only when absolutely necessary. Too often, IT has been forced to radically adapt due to massive platform shifts like mobile, or by users simply ‘voting with their feet’ and blaming IT for lost productivity. But the increasing consumerization of IT tools and services has opened up a parallel track that enables end users to lead innovation from outside the IT department. In other words, ten years ago, all the average employee could do to fix their company’s storage situation was to complain about how complicated and clunky their Microsoft SharePoint Server was. Those complaints would go ignored. Now the end user has the option to quickly open a Dropbox or Box account to begin sharing files with colleagues. No plumbing required.\nThat’s the big opportunity for former plumbers like me, who have moved on to interior design. We understand the IT department’s real needs, and how to get the mechanical parts of the system working correctly underneath the house. At the same time, we know that the average person just wants to turn on a faucet and have clean drinking water flow freely. By adding beautifully designed faucets to the mix, while not forgetting that important safety valves must be included in case of earthquakes, an “evolved plumber” can help both IT departs and end users alike.\nModern IT departments don’t need more infrastructure, they need better ways to help their end users easily consume information. They don’t need another platform to build on, they need new, innovative – and secure – ways that better empower end users to move information around their organization. Because end user demands are changing, IT is changing. And now, even some plumbers like me are changing too.\nJavier Soltero is CEO of  Acompli .\nOriginally posted by:\n", "deleted" : false }

Just look at disasters like News Corp’s acquisition of MySpace, eBay’s acquisition of Skype, or more recently, AOL’s acquisition of TechCrunch. Acquirers are so likely to overpay for their purchases, misjudge the potential synergies, or bungle the integration process that the majority of post-merger companies end up doing worse than their competitors, according to a litany of management studies.\nBut there are a few special tech companies where the executives seem to have figured out how to make acquisitions succeed—or at least, how to lower their failure rate. One of these is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ). In many of the markets where it’s now a huge player, Google got there through an acquisition: think of Keyhole (online mapping, 2004), Android (mobile operating systems, 2005), YouTube (user-generated video, 2006), Writely (online documents, 2006), Doubleclick (display advertising, 2007), AdMob (mobile advertising, 2009), and ITA Software (travel planning, 2010). Together, Google’s acquired companies generate billions of page views every day, along with the resulting ad profits.\nOf course, some of Google’s acquisitions haven’t turned out so well. After buying Dennis Crowley’s startup Dodgeball in 2005, Google famously missed out on its opportunity to build a location-based social network; Crowley left to found Foursquare. Google paid $50 million for social search startup Aardvark in 2010, only to shutter the service a year later. And most of the key executives who joined Google through the 2009 acquisition of AdMob—a $750 million deal—have already left the company.\nBut given the pace of acquisitions at Google (48 in 2011 alone), there are bound to be a few derailments. Overall, Google has a remarkably good track record at getting what it paid for—and sometimes a lot more. David Lawee, the company’s vice president of corporate development, says two-thirds of Google’s recent acquisitions have been successful, based on measures such as employee retention and revenues from the acquired teams or products. That’s a far higher success rate than the industry average, which studies put at roughly one-third to one-half.\nSuccess at M&A, though, didn’t come naturally. It was an acquired skill, so to speak—something the company only learned through practice as it grew. “Integration is a really well-honed process now,” Lawee says. “I certainly wouldn’t have said that four years ago. Four years ago we could get away with, ‘You are smart, figure it out,’ because it was a smaller business.”\nI went down to the Googleplex last month to meet with Lawee (pictured above right) and find out how the company honed its process. I subsequently interviewed three other Google executives who either help to manage acquisitions or have recently joined Google through an acquisition. I wanted to know what Google has learned that other companies haven’t. How does it figure out which companies it wants to buy, and whether their technologies will fit with existing Google products? How does it smooth the transition for newly acquired teams? How do former startup founders stay productive—and entrepreneurial—once they’re inside a 32,000-employee company? And when Google acquisitions do go wrong, why?\nSpeaking from Experience\nThe acquired Googlers I’ve talked with say it’s a friendly place for people who bring the typical startup founder’s passion and ambition. If there’s a source for that friendliness—other than the fact that Google was so recently a startup itself—it’s probably Lawee, the guy at the top of Google’s M&A operation.\nIt’s not a stretch to say Lawee is uniquely qualified for his job. He spent three years running marketing and product launches at Google before switching over to corporate development, so he has an insider’s understanding of the company’s needs. But he’s also ex-entrepreneur and ex-venture capitalist, so he’s seen every side of the startup process. “I understand viscerally what it’s like to … Next Page »\nWade Roush is a contributing editor at Xconomy.

Santa Monica, Calif.-based Playsino is taking advantage of that by launching its Playsino Publishing Network which it will aim at helping social casino game developers get new users and monetize them on Facebook and mobile platforms.\nPlaysino will publish casino games built by other developers and spend a minimum of $100,000 per title to market them. Playsino uses a dedicated media buying team and offers game production support as well.\n“Playsino is the only publisher focused exclusively on the hot social casino space.  Our focus will give our partners access to gamers who are specifically interested in casino style games and monetize better than all other social gamers,” says John Maffei, head of Playsino Publishing.\nIn 2012, social casino game players now account for 13 percent of all of the players on Facebook, compared to just 8 percent in 2011 and 6 percent in 2010, according to Kontagent . The analytics firm says that social casino games have higher-than-average revenue per user: at least 40 percent higher than a typical casual social game.\nPlaysino is headed by chief executive Brock Pierce, who is also a managing director of the Clearstone Global Gaming Fund. He has started, bought or invested in more than 30 game companies and secured more than $200 million on behalf of his companies. He has helped startups pioneer business models built around virtual goods and microtransactions.\nPlaysino is creating its own free-to-play casino games for mobile and social platforms. Playsino was founded in 2012. The company’s first game is Solitaire and Prizes. Maffei said in an interview with GamesBeat that the company plans to build out a suite of internally produced games, but it will also publish a number of titles from outside developers who create social casino games.\nPierce is also CEO of Titan Gaming. He also founded ZAM Network, a gaming media property with 15 million hardcore PC gamers. He sold that to Tencent in January. And he founded GamesTV, a joint venture with Shanghai Media Group.\nAlthough he has a lot of experience, Pierce has a small company among a lot of big ones. Rivals include Double Down Interactive, owned by slot machine giant WGT, social game giant Zynga, and a number of other social casino game startups.\n“The difference is we are 100 percent focused on the social casino game market,” Maffei said.\nMaffei said that the company has a good understanding of the ins and outs of user acquisition, and it also has good experience with game production in the social casino genre. The team has 15 employees, most of them developers. Playsino has raised $1.5 million in funding from  IDM Venture Capital, a Singapore-based venture capital firm, Pacific Capital Group, Siemer Ventures, and a number of angel investors.\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

There have been some surprises along the way, like Zynga, RockYou and MySpace making quick policy changes to protect consumers. But we want to end this series with a glimmer of hope, and a proposed way for app developers to make a good living over the long run. All previous posts can be read here (including updates at the bottom).\nDuring our research we spoke to dozens of scam artists, game developers, advertisers and legitimate and illegitimate middlemen. One company was consistently mentioned as being the most above board with their approach to the market – TrialPay . So to end the series, we’ve asked TrialPay CEO Alex Rampell to write a guest post on how he sees the market, and how it can move forward in a healthy way.\nTrialPay is an 80 person company company in the payment processing and promotions space that works with over 7500 companies like Skype, McAfee, Match.com, Photobucket, Kmart, 1800Flowers, and Playfish. Alex started TrialPay four years ago after pioneering the use of “alternative payments” in consumer software products and games, and previously co-founded a company that became known as SiteAdvisor.\nAlex believes that the recent coverage about the dangers of advertisements and advertising in the social gaming space is a welcome debate that may help save this industry from what this insider sees as the social gaming equivalent of the “ tragedy of the commons ,” where all constituents – users, advertisers, offer providers, and app developers – could permanently lose. The recent Zynga, RockYou, and MySpace announcements are an encouraging first step, but more needs to happen.\nUnconstrained Markets Can Create Harmful Advertisers\nIn an efficient ad marketplace, the top keyword usually goes to whoever can spend the most money on it, normalized for conversion. Who can afford to spend the most money? Unfortunately, it’s not always the company with the best product, service, or price; under pure laissez faire advertising, it can be the company that tricks, lies, and steals more pennies out of each customer than any competitor. This often forces ethical competitors to make a very tough choice: roll over and stagnate (or die), or play a similar game. Playing to win means staying microscopically behind the red line or breaking the rules and not getting caught.\nLet’s keep that as the backdrop as I tell a sordid story about lead generation on the Internet.\nOffers Can Be Done Well and Benefit Everyone\nFirst, “offers” and “incentives” don’t have to be dirty words, and when used properly provide consumers better value. Four quick examples:\nYou’re buying a new phone, say a Blackberry. You get the Blackberry for free if you agree to a 2 year contract with Verizon, but it’s at your option. You get a better price (free, if you’re OK being locked into Verizon), Verizon gets a guaranteed customer, and RIM sells another Blackberry.\nYou need to buy flowers for Valentine’s Day. You’d normally just search for “flowers” on Google, but you happen to already be on McAfee’s website evaluating anti-virus software. You see that you can get McAfee AntiVirus for free if you buy your flowers from FTD, so you shop at FTD. You get McAfee software for free, McAfee gets paid by FTD, and FTD gets a new customer.\nYou get $30 off your order at Amazon.com if you sign up for a (free) Amazon.com Visa card. Amazon gets a higher order since you spend more, Chase gets a new customer, and you get a better value.\nYou have $20 in your shopping cart at Amazon and you are offered free shipping if you spend another $5, so you buy another book and get free shipping.\nThese real examples work very well for all parties, all of them can be and have been extended to social games, and it would be hard to argue that they are not legitimate. The problem is that they are crowded out by less legitimate alternatives that are proliferating today, a theme which Michael nailed in his last post. Incentive marketing can be a disaster if not done right, though, and the “win-win-win” can turn into “lose-lose-lose.”\nTwo Examples of Getting It Right In Social Gaming\nExample Screenshot: Remember Amazon.com’s free shipping if you spend over $25? No such thing as shipping in online games, but Restaurant City, one of the leading Playfish games with over 17M monthly active users has offered customers a free movie ticket to anyone who selects the $39.99 option\nExample Screenshot: PetSociety, Playfish’s most popular title with over 21M monthly active users , enables customers to purchase flowers from FTD during Valentine’s Day and receive 8,000 coins toward their account.\nHistorically, Offers Have Been Implemented Poorly\nConsumers Scamming Advertisers – Cash For Clunkers: Back in the late 90’s and even after the bubble burst, a lot of companies offered you “cash” for signing up for offers (like Blockbuster, Vonage, etc). Netflip (aka MetaReward) scaled to nearly $70M in revenue before being shut down by its acquirer, Experian. The reason? The lead quality was bad – no, atrocious. At one point in 2006, Earthlink was paying $200 to acquire a customer for its moribund dialup business. “Cash back” sites would offer consumers $100 to sign up for a $20/month service, which said consumers would summarily cancel, netting the cash back site a $100 profit and Earthlink a $200 loss. Result: Consumers scammed advertisers, and advertisers ran for the hills, but it took years for this to happen and the ecosystem to devolve.\nAdvertisers Scamming Consumers – Free iPods: A few years later, and fueled by cheap media, “Free iPods” (often referred to as “Free iPod Scams” and later encompassing “Free [product X]”) grew to over a half billion dollar/year industry. It was a pure breakage model; your iPod would be delivered, but only if you got through dozens of pages of co-registration advertisements and offers. It got scammier and scammier since barriers to entry were low, and whoever scammed customers the most received the most revenue to get more customers. Everyone went along for the ride because every website and ad network benefited in the form of more “free iPod” advertisements. Eventually, the FTC came in. Result: Consumers got scammed, and legitimate advertisers ran for the hills, but this too took years.\nSocial Gaming Today: Offers Still Done Poorly, But With Hope?\nNow it’s 2009 and the age of social networking. Replace “free iPod” with “free virtual currency” and see if you can figure out how this story could end. It’s actually worse because every time a consumer signs up for another offer, he or she earns more currency – yet by the 100th offer, the chance of lead quality being high for non-shopping offers (e.g., Gap, BestBuy, Target, etc) is infinitesimal; somebody who immediately signs up for both Netflix and Blockbuster to earn coins will probably be a bad customer for both. Returning to the “tragedy of the commons,” the network (or app developer) with a conscience for quality who won’t let consumers do 100 untargeted offers will simply be out-monetized by the network/developer who will, and that hurts the long term prosperity of everyone.\nMany legitimate advertisers have already started to cut their payouts or bail, such that the “scammy” offers yield the highest returns. Many app developers don’t want to run scammy offers but don’t have a choice if they are to stay competitive in another tragedy of the commons.\nWhere Are the Complaints?\nThere’s also a large obfuscation layer between the user and the advertiser. It often looks like this:\nUser->App Developer->”Offer Provider” X->Ad Network Y->Advertiser\nThe offer providers are companies like Offerpal, SuperRewards, DoubleDing, Gambit, Firecue, GratisPay, and to some extent my own TrialPay, and ad networks are companies like Adteractive, CPAStorm, SearchCactus, Gratis Internet, ClickBooth, Affiliate.com, etc. The app developers often rotate different offer providers, and the offer providers often rotate different ad networks, even though the user at the beginning and the advertiser at the end stay constant. This makes it easier for users to scam advertisers, harder for offer providers to correctly track completions (there are more links in the chain to break – many people sign up for offers and are not “credited”), and easier for scammy offers to keep resurfacing such that the game publishers don’t always know what’s going on. It’s the price they pay for higher short term revenue.\nMoreover, user complaints are often directed at the advertiser since the offer provider and ad network are relatively invisible in this chain, which is why you’ll hear many app developers and offer providers claim they get no complaints even though scammy offers collectively yield tens of thousands of complaints to various attorneys general, the FTC, and internet message boards. Despite this clever obfuscation, it’s still bad for the game publisher; users have less money to spend directly (since they had a chunk of change “scammed” away), and ill-will is bred towards the game publisher.\nTo Prevent Further Damage, Here’s What Needs to Happen\nIt doesn’t have to end this way – there are numerous legitimate forms of incentive marketing (see my initial four examples), but they’re not as profitable on a short term basis as allowing users to scam advertisers 100 times, or allowing advertisers to scam users several times (even the most naïve users get the hint after a few interactions). This has been tough for my company because we’ve felt the only way for us to “win” was not to play the game, and focus on higher quality and sustainability. That’s ok because only a small fraction of our revenue comes from social gaming, so we aren’t desperate to monetize at any cost, but I’d hate to see the industry implode.\nSo how do we emerge from this sad state of affairs?\nMarket forces (hopefully). It’s about quality and not quantity. At some point, there may be an inflection point where the “legitimate” offers (shop at Gap, shop at BestBuy, etc), shown ONLY to the “legitimate” users, actually outperform scamming by users or scamming of users. This is because a disciplined approach yields higher quality, and advertisers reward higher quality with higher payouts. One reason why QuinStreet, a leading performance advertising company, beat its competition over the past decade was because it focused on the quality of its leads.\nRegulation (hopefully). Facebook cracks the whip and bans app developers who show scammy offers. I think most app developers would welcome this regulation as they don’t like this stuff but have no choice if their competitors do it.\nActions Needed Today\nThe solution is a mixture of both. Having Facebook crack the whip does nothing to solve the problem of users scamming advertisers, which imperils the whole ecosystem. Indeed, we work with companies like McAfee and Skype, assiduously measure our quality because we work directly with the vast majority of our advertisers, and we have seen the tremendous volume (and often abysmal quality) of incentivized social gaming traffic sour some advertisers to the point of throwing the baby out with the proverbial bathwater.\nThe problem is similar to click fraud in search engine marketing, and the solution is similar:\nAdvertiser Feedback Loops: Offer providers need to establish direct relationships with advertisers and create a quality feedback loop. The vast majority of our advertising deals are direct, and we insist on feedback loops (did the user “quick cancel” a trial?) so we can eliminate bad sources of traffic. It doesn’t mean that all of our traffic is perfect, but we spend a tremendous of time eliminating the negative externalities, which provide for better unit economics. App developers who care about quality might even want to consider working directly with advertisers, lest they receive the lowest common denominator of payouts from offer providers who don’t focus on quality.\nLimits on Offers: There should be strict limits on what users can sign up for – not by law but by rational self-interest, since this will yield more long term revenue. The vast majority of our “alternative payment” business revolves around letting users pay for an item like McAfee VirusScan by transacting with one and only one advertiser of the user’s choice. This increases the quality, which lets advertisers pay us more, and in turn lets us pay McAfee more. Advertisers will pay more if they recognize that fraud is lower and quality is higher, just like with search engine marketing. Multiple offers can work (e.g., retail shopping at different stores) but it’s much more complex in lead generation.\nGame Publishers Should Insist on Long-Term Partnerships: Game publishers who think about long term quality (and don’t swap out providers, where the providers don’t swap out networks) will make more long-term money – partially because they won’t burn as many customers, but primarily because quality breeds higher payouts from advertisers.\nLet’s hope we can solve the tragedy of the social gaming commons. Virtual currency is a multi-billion dollar industry growing at a massive rate, and reckless short term behavior can threaten an even more prosperous long term future.\n", "deleted" : false }

Using MacAfee's SiteAdvisor tool to compare almost 1,000 TRUSTe certified sites with over 500,000 non-certified web sites, Edelman discovered that \"TRUSTe-certified sites are more than twice as likely to be untrustworthy as uncertified sites.\"\nAccording to Edelman, the problem is that private certification organizations are reluctant to lose potential certification renewal revenue by revoking the certification of a client. TRUSTe claims that it \"systematically monitors the practices of seal program participants to ensure that ongoing compliance with posted privacy statements\" and that it provides a Watchdog Consumer Dispute Resolution service so that individual users can post complaints about sites that violate privacy policies. According to Edelman, despite \"the 3,416 complaints [about certified sites] received since January 2003, TRUSTe concluded that not a single one required any change to any member?s operations, privacy statement, or privacy practices, nor did any complaint require any revocation or on-site audit.\" Edelman also points out that \"only two certifications [have been] revoked in TRUSTe's ten-year history.\"\nTo further illuminate the inadequacy of trust certification standards, Edelman cites a 2004 investigation of a company called Gratis Internet in response to complaints filed by users. TRUSTe initially determined that Gratis was fulfilling its consumer privacy obligations, but later revoked the company's certificate when the New York Attorney General determined that the company had perpetrated a severe privacy violation by selling the private information of millions of users. In light of the \"allegations of low substantive standards, lax enforcement, and ethical compromise,\" web site trust certification providers, particularly TRUSTe, are not beneficial to consumers.\nTRUSTe responded in a blog entry , claiming that \"the study does not present a full or accurate review of TRUSTe?s program requirements, monitoring processes and enforcement tools.\" Drawing attention to various deficiencies of the SiteAdvisor tool, TRUSTe asserts that, \"in addition to several inaccuracies and misstatements, the study's conclusions are based on an underlying set of assumptions, without exposition the methodology, definitions, and approach giving rise to such assumptions.\" The TRUSTe blog entry also states that, of the specific sites referenced by Edelman, three of the four are either \"no longer in the TRUSTe program,\" or never certified to begin with and were included in a TRUSTe customer list by mistake.\n", "deleted" : false }

After a rigorous software evaluation, LINC chose Intacct over other on-premises and cloud solutions as the best fit to meet the needs of the organization.\nPrevious Business Challenges Faced by LINC Houston's Finance Team:\nManually manipulating data in order to consolidate funds for reporting purposes took time away from analyzing that data and making more strategic decisions.\nLINC was running their financials in an on-premises server environment, and VPN issues could make the system inaccessible at times.\nThe organization is growing quickly and adding locations. Their legacy accounting system couldn't scale to handle that growth.\nReasons for Selecting Intacct:\nIntacct provides LINC with real-time visibility into their data through easy to read dashboard reports.\nIntacct’s open API environment makes it easy to work with other systems, either through a live connection or via a quick CSV import.\nIntacct’s “best in class” methodology allows LINC to choose the products, like a payroll system, that best meet their needs instead of being forced to work under one specific vendor’s choice.\nHighlighted Comments from LINC Houston's Director of Operations:\n\"With Intacct's dimensions, we can expand easily,\" said Matthew Schultz, Director of Operations. \"Even in the last month, we realized things we needed to report on and it was as simple as adding another department. Literally a few clicks and types and you’re done. I wouldn’t even know where to start in our old system.\n\"The AcctTwo team has immense expertise and great customer handling skills. AcctTwo did a fantastic job with keeping us on track to go-live.\"\nAdditional resources:\n", "deleted" : false }

(Via MerlinFTP Drop)\n(Photo: Penthouse)\nPenthouse, the adult magazine founded by Bob Guccione, said Tuesday it has no plans to shut down print publishing even as plans for the website's overhaul are underway, refuting reports that the magazine's days are numbered.\n\"We are truly committed to the magazine,\" Kelly Holland, managing director of Penthouse Entertainment, said Tuesday. \"There's gravitas about the print page that you can't replace.\"\nThe magazine, now owned by online dating site operator FriendFinder Networks, closed its publishing division's office in New York and consolidated magazine operations in Los Angeles, where it has licensing and broadcast units. Holland declined to specify the number of layoffs in New York. She said the magazine has \"under 100\" employees.\nThe company's statement comes on the heels of reports by CNBC and other news outlets that the magazine will be shuttered. \"\"Penthouse Magazine will continue to be published in print during the transition to digital. No specific date to stop print publication of our flagship magazine has been set,\" Ezra Shashoua, CFO of FriendFinder Networks, was quoted as saying in the CNBC report.\nHolland says the reports misinterpreted the company's press release , which was issued to announce the planned relaunch of the magazine's website, Penthousemagazine.com. \"Can I promise we will be publishing print in five years? No, but as long as we can keep it profitable, we will carry it forward,\" Holland said.\nShe declined to answer when asked if the magazine is profitable. \"It's challenging,\" she said.\nThe new site, which Holland hopes to complete by March, will feature the magazine's stories and photos, as well as other \"daily updates,\" she said. It'll feature new blogs, \"vintage\" photos from its archives, a section featuring \"interesting photographers with interesting takes,\" Holland said, citing Men's Health's website as a model. It'll be available to all print subscribers. Digital-only subscribers will pay a smaller, as-yet-undisclosed fee.

The slump in sales across the tablet sector has been blamed on the accelerating popularity of tablet-phone hybrids such as Samsung’s Galaxy Note series of devices.\nThe holiday quarter will be the first indication whether a slimmer, quicker, higher-resolution version of the iPad will reverse the decline in sales or if the cannibalization of the tablet industry by giant-screen smartphones will continue unabated. Another feature expected to grace the latest generation of tablets is Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor for logging in and making purchases.\nPerhaps Apple’s best hope for a rebound in tablet sales will come from the courtship of businesses and the education market. It has cultivated schools and universities since the PC era. More recently, it struck a partnership with IBM to stage a swifter incursion into the enterprise.\nHowever, a larger 12.9-inch iPad — one that would likely appeal to corporate customers — won’t arrive until next year, according to Strategy Analytics analyst Peter King, who has contacts in the manufacturing supply chain.\nCook also is expected to offer more details about the launch of Apple Pay, the company’s foray into mobile payments.\nApple announced it had incorporated near field communications technology in its iPhone 6 smartphones and the forthcoming Apple Watch, clearing the way for consumers to make secure purchases without breaking out their wallets.\nA number of major banks, credit card companies and retailers have already embraced Apple Pay — including MasterCard and Visa, Bank of America and Chase, as well as Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, McDonald’s, Subway and Walgreens. Apple Pay is expected to work at some 220,000 stores around the country where this form of wireless payment has been enabled.\nApple is capitalizing on existing technology standards and groundwork laid three years ago by Google, when it introduced Google Wallet in partnership with some of the same players. It’s also aided by a shift in liability that takes effect in October 2015, one that leaves retailers picking up the tab for fraud if they fail to install more secure terminals.\nTransactions are something Apple and its partners will need to execute flawlessly, without any embarrassing glitches like the recent update to its iOS 8 mobile operating system that briefly disconnected about 40,000 iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users from their mobile networks.\nOther news expected during the event is an update of the iMac computer and the consumer availability of the OS X Yosemite computer operating system that it previewed in June at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.\nJoin us for live coverage of the event on Thursday at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET.\nUpdate: File under “oops.” Apple’s latest iPad User guide, available through iTunes, includes a screenshot of the upcoming iPad Mini 3 and iPad Air 2, which shows both devices will be built with the TouchID fingerprint scanner. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. (h/t Mark Gurman, 9to5Mac )\nrecode_divider\n", "deleted" : false }

Saïd Amin runs World Singles , which includes such sites as ArabLounge.com , EligibleGreeks.com , HyeSingles.com , IranianPersonals.com and SoulSingles.com . - Mark Brooks\nWhat kind of scamming do you encounter on World Singles?\nMost of the scammers originate from Africa and parts of the Middle East, but they are increasingly working with people in the USA/Canada. I think that scammers are a big problem for the entire industry. They pose as someone they are not, usually as a very attractive male or female and prey on unsuspecting members This is usually done by showing interest in those members via a flirt/email or by waiting for someone to contact them first. The more aggressive scammers will buy memberships and usually proceed to send a bevy of emails.\nScammer networks have since become more sophisticated. Two years ago it was a lot easier to review profiles and detect them. They have become more sophisticated with how they cover up their profiles. For example, we identify blocks of IP addresses originating from certain countries as high risk and take a second hard look at those profiles. Nowadays we are seeing an increasing number of profiles from USA/Canada based members that are also being logged in from IP addresses in other countries. So it’s essentially someone overseas working with someone in the States who, let’s say, has an AOL or Comcast account, and are working in tandem. It makes it more difficult for us to detect them. I wouldn’t be surprised if there are overseas scammer conferences or published books available on the black market that cover scamming 101 tips and strategies.\nHow serious is this scamming issue?\nHow serious? Every dating site is plagued by scammer activity; some sites and niches attract more scammers than others. I think one scammer is one too many. Singles are bravely taking ownership for their journey, posting a dating profile and putting themselves out there in the hopes of increasing their chances for finding a romantic partner. Members who join dating sites are trusting us to help them find a partner in a safe environment. Scammers, work to undermine this trust with our brand and the dating industry as a whole.\nI agree and that’s my next question actually, what kind of effect do you think it has on the industry for the long term?\nIt hurts the industry but it is also an opportunity because it increases the value of the companies who diligently invest time and energy to ensure a safe space for singles to meet. I think that a lot of sites in the dating sector are not responsible enough in how they address scammers as far as educating their members and being transparent when scammer emails are sent and read by unsuspecting members.\nWhen catching a scammer we suspend their profile, remove the messages that they sent and replace them with a message explaining that they have received an email from a person/scammer who is posing as someone he/she is not. There’s certainly a PR hit when this occurs; a member may have invested time emailing back and forth and now the site is recommending that they cease all communication with this individual whom we suspect to be scammer. Talk about taking the air out of a balloon of someone who may have been really excited at his or her initial communiqué with a member. Some members appreciate our proactive nature, but generally speaking there’s still a PR hit. Nevertheless, I feel that this is a responsible way to address such cases. I rather be up front with our members rather than brushing it under the rug and let our members continue emailing back forth on or off the site and risk getting scammed out of money, time, and emotions.\nWhat else are you doing right now to combat scammers?\nWe double check every membership sold and review screened profiles with high risk IP addresses a second time. The same applies to profiles that have been accessed by multiple IP addresses.  There are some internal tools that we use to help us and are looking to companies like Iovation for additional measures to assist us in eliminating scammer activity.\nWhat time does scamming take from your day?\nIt takes up time and resources. From dealing with charge backs, reviewing IP addresses, profiles, double checking the profile/billing details for sold memberships etc., we spend a few hours each day on this.\nHow do you think the industry can work together to combat scammers?\nThe idea has been floated around by others, but it would be great to have one company that specializes in cleaning out databases or one place where all dating site operators can share banned IP addresses, email addresses, pictures, nicknames, etc. Doing so would behoove dating operators, the dating industry as a whole and most importantly, help protect our members.\nWhat do you think the industry would pay?\nI can’t speak for others but we are open to spending a good chunk of money for a service that would help fight scammer activity. The price points for such services should be determined by their value, as defined by a decrease in charge backs and overall effectiveness in catching paid/non paid scammers. Preventing scammers from joining our niche dating sites is of utmost importance and something we take pride in addressing on a daily basis. I have a responsibility to protect our members from scammers and while I’m probably not going to bat 100%, I’m striving for 100% nonetheless.\nMay 24, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

The pivot was handled skilfully. The original vision remains, and Ray hopes to be able to launch it in the next couple of years. Very good, deliberate execution.\nSramana Mitra: Let’s start at the very beginning of your personal journey. Where are you from? Where are you raised? What kind of background do you come from?\nRay Grainger: I was born and raised in Southern California. Though I’ve lived, traveled, and worked in many places around the globe, I’ve always called Southern California home. From an upbringing perspective, I’m from a middle-class environment. One of the key things that is fundamental is, I grew up in the 70s. In the 70s, divorce was a growing trend especially in California.\nBy the time I was 18, my mother and father had been divorced five times. I was moving from one house to another. What that really instilled in me as I became an adult  was an independent mindset. You really had to be responsible for yourself and really own your own life from a very early age. That’s essentially what I did.\nSramana Mitra: Did you have early interest in math, science, and engineering?\nRay Grainger: I did. In high school, those were always my favourite subjects. I liked things that were concrete. I like to take things that were abstract and then somehow make them concrete. Right out of high school, I didn’t go directly to college. I went to work for the National Science Foundation on two expeditions to the South Pole. I just called my own shots, did my own thing, and charted my own course. While all my friends were applying to college, I was applying to the National Science Foundation to go on an expedition to the South Pole.\nSramana Mitra: What did you get from that? That’s a unique experience at a very early age. What was the takeaway nugget from that?\nRay Grainger: It was one of those foundational building blocks to my own identity in life. Down there, there were very limited resources. I had a job that had to get done. I participated in building an emergency camp. If something happens, you have to be very innovative and very adaptable. You can’t just go to a hardware store. You have to invent and make things up along the way. Schedule was paramount. There was no turning back. The other one was adaptability.

That didn’t work out as hoped, but chief executive Lowell Goss says the Pasadena, Calif. company has bounced back with a business-focused offering and a new funding round of less than $1 million.\nBack when Loud3r first launched, VentureBeat writer Eric Eldon was skeptical that “ what the world needs is more news aggregators. ” It sounds like Loud3r encountered the same questions when it tried and failed to raise a first round of venture funding last fall (which was, to be fair, a terrible time for everyone trying to raise money). Goss says that forced the company to rethink its business, and now, rather than trying to make money with its news network, Loud3r is selling its technology to other companies.\nCompetitors now include OneSpot, which sells news aggregation technology to publiactions like the Wall Street Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle . But Goss says Loud3r is different because it uses semantic technology to distinguish when a similar word or phrase means different things (Robert Smith the American politician vs. Robert Smith the singer for the cure, for example), and because it isn’t just focused on news articles, or any specific type of content. Instead, it brings diverse content together into a single feed.\n“For a user, if that content comes from Twitter or if it comes from Flickr, those aren’t necessarily two different things,” Goss says.\nLoud3r has signed up three customers since it started selling its technology to companies at the beginning of this year, Goss adds, with two or three newspaper partnerships to be announced soon. And those customers aren’t just using Loud3r on a single site — NameMedia , for example, tested Loud3r on 75 sites and is now expanding beyond that. Name was also happy enough with the technology to provide the new funding, which is Loud3r’s first institutional round. (It previously raised $750,000 in convertible debt.)\nNameMedia president Jeff Bennett says Loud3r’s technology is an obvious fit with Name’s business model, which involves buying up lots of domains and then filling them with inexpensive content. You can see examples of Loud3r-powered Name sites at artist.com and landscaping.com . Name is a private company itself, with more than $100 million in funding from Highland Capital Partners and Summit Partners , Bennett says.\nSo with the new direction, what will happen to Loud3r’s network of cleverly-/obnoxiously-named news sites like Found3r and Watch3r ? The company will keep them around to test new technology and features. And when asked about it, Goss sounds like he hasn’t completely given up hopes of building a media empire sometime in the future …\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPress Releases\n", "deleted" : false }

The first 200 readers to send an e-mail to info [at] tripsay [dot] com with “TechCrunch” in the subject will get a beta invite.\nTripSay combines social recommendations with a travel search engine that auto-suggests cities, pubs, hotels, and the like as you type them in. They appear as icons on a map, with a photo (pulled from Flickr) and description on the side, a tag cloud below, and minifeed of all the places you and your friends have rated or recommended.  The detail page for each city shows other TripSay members who have visited, tips from members, the most interesting Flickr photos tagged with the name of the city, links elsewhere on the Web, and a list of the top-rated places shown on a map.\nOn TripSay, the more people you connect to, the more places you can find that they’ve rated or tips they’ve shared. Everything can be rated with a five-point system (smiley face to butt). The site design is intuitive and pleasing, and once more people start adding their ratings, tips, and tags, it will become more useful. My biggest quibble is that if TripSay’s search engine cannot find a place (like teh Gramercy Tavern restaurant in New York City), there is no way to add it so that it appears on the map. But you can add it as a tip, and link to a blog post about it if you like.  And, in general, the search is pretty good. (Update: It turns out you can add a place by simply clicking on a map, but you have to discover that for yourself. It would help if they somehow made that clearer. Update 2: The business model, which I should have mentioned, is highly-targeted travel-related ads and affiliate fees to travel booking sites).\nTravel, by its nature, is normally a very social experience. Most of us need help from other humans when we are in a strange place. TripSay joins a whole new group of social travel sites that are now emerging , such as Driftr , HereOrThere , and YowTrip . It also adds elements of guided vertical search like Uptake (formerly Kango). Travel sites that don’t make social connections a central part of their experience will have to continue to compete on more utilitarian grounds such as price and place discovery. And that is a very competitive business. The new social travel sites will compete not so much on how good their pricing data is, but rather on how knowledgeable their community is. Which social travel would you want to be a part of?\n", "deleted" : false }

The companies aren’t disclosing the financial terms of the deal, but Elston tells me that it was a mix of cash and stock, and that Yobongo’s investors (who include Mitch Kapor, Dave Morin, Kevin Rose, Gary Vaynerchuk, Karl Jacob, Bill Roux, Shervin Pishevar, Freestyle Capital, and True Ventures) are now investors in Mixbook.\nElston makes it sound like he, his team, and his investors are all pretty happy with the deal, but there’s a downside — the Yobongo app itself will be disappearing. It will be pulled from the App Store today, and it will shut down completely in a month or two.

For one thing, it has shipped 10 million Mixbook products. He’s also excited about the possibility of reinventing that experience for mobile devices. The goal, he says, is to create an app that makes it easier than ever to transform your photos into a book — and also into a high-quality digital viewing experience, so it can reach a broader group of friends and family.\n“Mixbook’s customers are not geeks — they’re moms, they’re sisters, they’re daughters, they’re husbands who are building things for their families,” Elston says. “They don’t care about the technology at all, and I love that.

It also will continue to operate as a stand-alone entity and retain its 26 employees.\nBoth McGuire and CEO Brian Wiegand, who has launched three start-up companies, will remain with Jellyfish.com.\nMcGuire said a key to the deal is the company’s continued presence in Madison. “We’re excited about keeping our base of operations in Madison,” he said. “There has been a lot of talk about us growing right here.”\nJellyfish.com is pioneering the Value Per Action (VPA) Internet advertising model, which it characterizes as a “Robin Hood-like search engine” that takes a percentage of the revenue customers generate through their buying habits and gives back 50 percent of it.\nFor Microsoft, the deal is the latest piece of a strategy to chip away at Google’s dominance of online advertising. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has said publicly that up to 25 percent of the company’s revenue in the next four to 10 years could be generated from advertising. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, the Redmond, Wash. software giant reported net revenues of $51.1 billion, a 15 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, and net income of $14 billion, a 12 percent jump.\nThe Microsoft Live Search team said the Jellyfish.com platform technology “has some interesting potential applications” as Microsoft continues to heavily invest in shopping and commerce as a component of Live Search, the Microsoft Internet search engine. In May, Microsoft paid $6 billion to acquire aQuantive , a digital marketing company based nearby in Seattle.\nFor Jellyfish.com, the acquisition is an opportunity to expand access to Microsoft’s customer base, grow its revenue, and add new capabilities. McGuire said details of those growth plans would be discussed in the forthcoming weeks and months.\n“We’re still in very early stages of our [growth] discussions with Microsoft,” said McGuire, who declined to disclose the privately held company’s recent quarterly revenue performance.\nMcGuire also declined to confirm the acquisition price, but one source told WTN that Microsoft paid $50 million for the the Madison company. The deal, which according to McGuire faces no regulatory hurdles, will provide an earlier-than-expected return for investors who deployed venture capital to Jellyfish.com. In October of 2006, the company accepted $5 million in funding from Kegonsa Capital Partners and Clyde Street Investments.\nInvestors appear to have reacted somewhat negatively to the deal. Shares of Microsoft stock, which stood at $29.70 at the close of trading on Oct. 2, had declined 38 cents to $29.32 as of 2:45 p.m. Central Standard Time.\nBetting on a new model\nIn VPA, Jellyfish.com believes it has invented a new and better form of Internet advertising to rival price-per-click advertising, which currently is the most prevalent online advertising model. With Jellyfish.com, Internet shoppers compare the prices of products from online stores, and the company refunds part of the revenue to customers that buy through its website. It’s a model that Microsoft may emulate in its high-stakes duel with Google.\nRelated stories\n", "deleted" : false }

The terms were not disclosed.\nPlaydom’s General Counsel Brad Serwin said in an interview that his company is bullish on social game talent in Argentina. He added, “There seems to be a style there (in game development) different from what is seen in the U.S., which adds a dimension to our game design and art.”\nHe cited Three Melons game Bola, a Facebook soccer application, saying that “this is a game designed for an international audience.” He explained that, “Americans (entrepreneurs) can be US-centric, but Argentines appear to be international” in terms of which markets their products appeal to, a big plus for Playdom and its’ global ambitions.\nThis is its second foray into South America just this month. On March 16, it announced a $5 million investment in Argentina’s Metro Games .\nAs part of today’s announcement, Three Melons CEO and co-founder Mariano Suarez Battan now becomes a Playdom Executive Producer. His main role will be to continue to run Three Melons in Buenos Aires, but when asked if he will play a role in Playdom business development in Latin America, Serwin said that, “we certainly hope so. He and his senior leadership are our Senior Representatives in Latin America for the foreseeable future.”\nHe did however caution that, “I would not look for additional deals in the region in the near future.”\nI also reached Suarez Battan today and asked why he sold now instead of holding out and perhaps even launching an IPO from Buenos Aires. He said that, “the gaming industry is consolidating now and it is the big players that are growing very rapidly.” He maintains that this was his best option to keep up with the pace of the industry.\nWe have written about Three Melons before . It was one of the first companies selected for the Endeavor Mentor Capital Pilot program, launched in Montevideo, Uruguay last September. Endeavor is the New York-based non-profit that seeks to promote entrepreneurial networking in the developing world.\nWe have also written about how not just Argentina but the Southern Cone including Chile and Uruguay is rich with gaming companies. In Buenos Aires, other gaming companies include QV9, Sabarasa, Hungry Games, and Atommica. French company Game Loft also has development here. Suarez Battan estimates that 1500 people work in game development in Buenos Aires.\nThree Melons is known for its Daiquiri technology, a game engine that makes 2D with flash appear three-dimensional. It was also an early adopter of Unity 3D technology. It has developed games for Lego, MTV, and Disney.\nThe company was founded in 2005 with $150,000 from friends, family and fools, according to Suarez Battan. In 2009, it received $300,000 from Argentina’s Banco Santander Rio’s Nexo Emprendedor program, a fund started to promote entrepreneurship here.\nSuarez Battan credits the program for helping Three Melons transform from a service company to a product-based company.\nWhile many in Silicon Valley only think of South America in terms of outsourcing, the few times they think of it all, Suarez Battan is part of a new generation of Argentine entrepreneurs who are increasingly product-focused and globally oriented .\nThis acquisition is likely to boost their spirits as well, according to Wences Casares, an Argentine gaming and entrepreneurial pioneer and now CEO and co-founder of Palo Alto-based Bling Nation .\nCasares co-founded Wanako Games in Santiago, Chile in 2002. Vivendi acquired it in 2007.\nHe calls today’s deal “the first of a kind” for Argentina and says that Three Melons now becomes a bridge between other entrepreneurs here and Silicon Valley. He says that now, “a lot more young developers from Argentina are going to come to Silicon Valley, and a lot of knowledge transfer is going to take place, whether they like it or not.”\nCasares also believes that Three Melons serves as another example of how young Argentine companies can bypass the traditional business-political dynamic in Argentina, which remains laden with cronyism and corruption. Twenty and thirty-somethings like Suarez-Battan are discovering they can skip the hassles of selling in Argentina and instead launch global companies from here.\nCasares says that, “this is what these kids are figuring out today.”\nCasares appears to have played a facilitating role in the Playdom-Three Melons relationship. Bling Nation board member Chamath Palihapitiya is also on Playdom’s board (in addition to his day-job as Facebook executive) and helped introduce Playdom CEO John Pleasants to Argentina, according to Casares.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

This application lets you send instant messages through any of the major messengers, engage in group chat, upload photos to your photo sharing site, and update your blog. It will also soon allow you to access many of the most popular social networks, and is in the process of building a mobile ad-serving technology.\nThey’re familiar because a handful of other companies are doing something very similar, or at least parts of it. They include Migg33 ( our coverage ), Nimbuzz and Crickee , which offer similar messaging and functions, but do not integrate with blogging platforms and social networks. There’s MocoSpace , designed for communicating with random people ( our coverage ). Trutap’s most direct competitor is Bluepulse, a service from Australia that launched last year to strong acclaim , and which told VentureBeat last week that it now has close to 100 million page views a month. Both want to become full-fledged social networks, like Facebook or Myspace — only for mobile phones.\nFlirtomatic , another UK based mobile designed for “flirting,” said it too had more than 100 million WAP impressions for the month of August — or a 100-fold increase from November.\nTrutap integrates messaging with a series of mobile widgets for Flickr, Blogger, and many more. Trutap says it will differentiate through partnerships with the major social networks and carriers, but this is yet to be seen.\nDespite its debut at the Techcrunch40 event in San Francisco, Trutap is not really focusing on the U.S. market.  It focuses instead on parts of the world where broadband penetration is relatively low, and where a mobile phone is a teenager’s most accessible means of connecting to the web.

Earl Grey. Hot.” A steaming cup would magically materialize, as Chris Anderson recalls in Makers: The New Industrial Revolution. The cabinet was called the Replicator, and it produced food along with the dishes, napkins, and silverware.\nWe can’t make the tea with 3D printers yet, but we can make the cup, the saucer, and the spoon. 3D printers, laser cutters, and digitally controlled milling machines are here and getting cheaper by the month. There’s even a machine called the Replicator, designed as an open-source project and marketed by MakerBot Industries, a company based in Brooklyn. It costs $1,750, fits on a desktop, and prints designs, made by the user or downloaded from the Web, using a nozzle similar to the one in an inkjet printer, spewing successive layers of molten plastic onto a moving platform. As each new layer of plastic is laid, a plastic mug begins to rise. Depending on its size, it might take 45 minutes to complete.\nWired Magazine editor-in-chief Chris Anderson discusses the future of 3D printing with Bloomberg Television's Olivia Sterns. He appeared on \"Last Word\" on September 20.\nEnthusiasts have coalesced around these machines, much as hackers did around the early personal computer. They range from scientists who want to print organs to designers who want to print instant prototypes to manufacturers who want to customize small batches of products. Broadly, they call themselves makers. They meet in collective workshops called maker spaces, such as Tech Shop, to share tools and expertise. Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired, knights these makers as future industrialists who will drive a new age of manufacturing.\nJust as the Web changed, redistributed, and sped up the diffusion of information—and created and destroyed businesses along the way—Anderson argues that desktop production and design will change manufacturing from a cumbersome process based on capital to a flexible one based on creativity. And in his estimation, the change will be orders of magnitude more important economically. The Web accounts for less than 20 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, according to Anderson. The vast majority of American economic output comes from making, moving, and selling physical goods.\nIt is, in Anderson’s eyes, going to be an amateur movement. He writes, “It’s exactly what happened with the Web, which was colonized first by technology and media companies, who used it to do better what they already did. Then software and hardware advances made the Web easier to use for regular folks (it was ‘democratized’), and they charged in with their own ideas, expertise, and energy. Today the vast majority of the Web is built by amateurs, semipros, and people who don’t work for big technology and media companies.”\nThe do-it-yourself revolution has yet to upend everyday life. It is, though, revolutionizing things like accessories for Lego mini figures. Anderson writes about the startup BrickArms, which began when software engineer Will Chapman wanted to make realistic looking weapons for his kids’ Lego figurines. Now he mass-produces tiny M-16 rifles, bazookas, and Tommy guns for children worldwide. Anderson quotes Chapman saying, “I bring in more revenue on a slow BrickArms day than I ever did working as a software engineer.”\nAnderson’s revolution is not just about 3D printers, of course. It’s about technology letting ideas from individuals blossom in different ways. The Web allows an inventor to find investors on Kickstarter and engineers on social media sites, and to put their designs out to tender on sites like MFG.com, where machine shops around the world bid on production. Anderson is a maker, too. In 2007 he started a company called DIY Drones, which sells open source mini helicopters and airplanes with programmable autopilot. Most of the design work comes from an online community, which serves both as customer and engineer. The company broke $3 million in revenue last year and just opened a factory in Tijuana. The CEO of DIY Drones, 26-year-old Jordi Muñoz, was originally one of Anderson’s designers and customers. Muñoz had never graduated from college but didn’t need to. “I didn’t ask for a résumé,” Anderson writes. “It wasn’t necessary. That guy had already proven himself by making extraordinary things.”\nOn a larger scale, Anderson cites Local Motors, a new type of car company based in Chandler, Ariz., that crowdsourced the design of a $75,000 Baja racer called the Rally Fighter. The vehicle is as much a Frankencar as an original object. The engine and transmissions come from BMW and General Motors, and the axles from a Ford F-150 truck. The car is partly assembled by the owners as part of the deal, which makes it a sort of kit car as well. The chapter is assembled, in part, from “In the Next Industrial Revolution, Atoms Are the New Bits,” an article Anderson wrote for Wired in 2010.\nSo what has Anderson made here? It’s hard to disagree with him and his outlook for the makers—it’s cool stuff and going to change things. But it’s hard to agree with as much enthusiasm as he seems to demand. Inspiration fatigue sets in by the end of the book. It’s like sitting through a few too many TED talks. Anderson himself betrays signs everywhere of being a bit bored with the grunt work of assembling a soaring outlook. The book is filled with pronouncements like “In short, the Maker Movement has arrived.” He ends the very first chapter not with his own thoughts, but with a long quote from someone else, Cory Doctorow, the co-editor of the blog Boing Boing. Doctorow is also an evangelist for DIYers, and his book, as Anderson acknowledges, is also called Makers. By the end of Anderson’s Makers, it’s almost too easy to imagine him standing before his own Replicator in a close-fitting shirt, displaying all of Patrick Stewart’s gravity and ordering: “Book. DIY Movement. Inspiring.” Then out pops this one.\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE\n", "deleted" : false }

(s TWX) to manage and distribute large video files with advanced metadata and search capabilities attached — but that could change with the newest version of its VideoSense platform. That’s because the company has built new clipping and editing capabilities into VideoSense 2.5, which could open up a whole new market opportunity for Digitalsmiths with news and sports organizations.\nAdvertisement\n“Once an asset’s in the system, [our customers] don’t just want to get it from point A to point B, but they also want to be able to edit that asset,” Weinberger said in an interview with NewTeeVee. So the company developed a clip editing system within VideoSense that allows customers to quickly chop up a master file into shorter segments, creating whole new video assets to be managed within its system.\nAdvertisement\nBecause VideoSense recognizes different scenes, faces and objects to create metadata, the system can even suggest segments within a file for users to clip. And because the platform associates all metadata with a timestamp within the master file, when those segments are created, only the metadata that’s relevant to an individual clip will be transferred to the new video asset.\nAdvertisement\nWith the new editing and clipping capabilities, Digitalsmiths isn’t just serving film studios and TV programmers anymore — the company is also picking up customers in the news and sports industries. “This is a very powerful tool for them. They no longer need to have an editor sitting down with expensive editing equipment to create these clips,” Weinberger said.\nAdvertisement\nThe video clipping functionality is somewhat unique to Digitalsmiths in the white-label video management space, although TV indexing firm Critical Media offers similar capabilities to news organizations through its own Syndicaster platform. While Critical Media doesn’t have the same type of distribution capabilities as Digitalsmiths, it has a partnership to enable customers to distribute clips directly into Brightcove’s video management platform.\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to the new editing and clipping features, VideoSense 2.5 adds a couple of other product enhancements, including a new reporting and analytics dashboard that’s fully integrated into the publishing system. The new reporting system is designed to provide granular viewing data across all of an asset’s distribution points, while also enabling publishers to track viewership by metadata. By having access to that data, customers should be able to better monetize their assets, while also being able to make better future publishing decisions, Weinberger said.\nAdvertisement\nFinally, the new version of VideoSense provides a direct way for users to upload an asset from their desktops, doing away with the need to move it between various FTP sites or watch folders. Using technology from Aspera, the direct upload feature also enables more efficient file transfers than customers would see otherwise.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

As new technologies are tested, integrated, and adopted, there are more and more dimensions to study.\nThe good news is that app developers have more options to monetize than ever between in-­app purchases and advertising. Indicators help you to maximize your understanding of how your app is being used and how effectively you are monetising it. The bad news is that there are so many indicators, making it very hard to separate the valuable information from the distracting noise.\nToo much of anything is bad. Analytics and measurements are no different. So, here are the 11 most fundamental formulas and metrics for app monetization, divided into two categories: in­-app monetization metrics, and advertising metrics.\nMonetization metrics\n1. LTV, LT, eCPI, K\nLT​ is ‘lifetime,’ or the period of time, normally calculated in months, for how long someone uses your app before they stop using it. The longer someone uses your app, the better your stats will be. You’ll see why LT is important when calculating the next formulas.\neCPI​is the ‘effective cost per install’ or how much it’s costing you to get a new user to use your app. It’s different from C​PI​ (cost per install), because a good app maker does not pay for each and every new user, there is a viral effect of word­ of­ mouth that helps drive installs too. This is known as the K​factor, ​or the viral coefficient. To figure out your e​CPI, divide your CPI by K.​\nLTV​ might be one of the most important indicators, and it stands for ‘lifetime value’ of a user of your app, or how much each user is worth to you over the course of the time that they will use your app. It’s easy to calculate your L​TV: monthly revenue per user ­ monthly expenses per user, like CPI) x lifetime (in months).\nThe most important takeaway here is that if the LTV is not higher than the eCPI, your app is going to be costing you more than it brings in. A good benchmark to shoot for (when earning revenue from advertising) is when your users’ average LTV is 2­3 times higher than your eCPI.\n2. ARPU, ARPPU, ARPDAU\nARPU​is ‘average revenue per user’ and is n​ormally cited in terms of months .​ Therefore, the calculation is m​onthly revenue divided by MAU (monthly active users). ​Many apps that have multiple tiers segment their users between paying and non­-paying users. If this is the case with your app, then you are probably looking at A​RPPU,​ or ‘average revenue per paying user.’ This is dividing the revenue by the number of people who paid something, which will end up making your A​RPPU much larger than your ARPU​ because it’s not diluted by all the free users.\nDepending on the popularity of your app, you might be able to glean positive insights by measuring ARPDAU​, or ‘average revenue per daily active user.’ As a rule, people who use your app every day are most valuable. So if those people have a high ARPU, that bodes well for the future of your app because the challenge to development comes from getting people to use your app every day. If you have a low ARPDAU, then even if your app becomes very popular and people use it every day, it won’t project much revenue.\n3. FUUU factor\nIn gaming, the FUUU Factor is an important measurement of how people continue to interact with your game. It’s a general scale of difficulty for different levels, and a g​ood gaming app maker will use this​to their advantage.\nThe formula is t​he number of tries until won / number of times you almost won a level. ​According to PocketGamer : “the more frustratingly close calls, the lower the FUUU factor ­ and a lower FUUU factor leads to a more motivated, enraged, and engaged player.”\n4. Churn rate, retention rate, return rate\nThe r​etention rate​is just like it sounds, it’s the n​umber of people who install your app​ today , use it, and then come back and use it tomorrow. And the day after that, etc. Since it’s a percentage, retention of a cohort (the people who sign up on any given date) will decline over time. This is due to c​hurn,​or when people stop using your app and switch to something else. The formula to calculate c​hurn is 1 minus your retention rate.​\nThe r​eturn rate ​is a ratio of the n​umber of your users who are active​during a given time period relative to the size of their cohort group. This is particularly useful for optimizing your marketing because you can see which users became more active depending on when and from where they installed.\n5. Duration and engagement\nDuration ​is similar to LT; it’s the average number of months someone uses your app. The established calculation is 1​ divided by your churn rate. ​E​ngagement ​is probably the most straightforward. It’s usually measured by D​AU​ (daily active users) or M​AU​ (monthly active users); whichever number sounds better is usually the one to go with!\nAdvertising Metrics\n6. eCPM\neCPM is ‘effective cost per mille (thousand)’ which is a variation on the traditional CPM, or how much it costs to reach 1,000 users. When a campaign is expressed in CPM, then the e​CPM is exactly the same .​ When a campaign is CPC (cost per click) there is an effective CPM because even users that don’t click still see an ad.\nThe formula is in three parts. First multiply the CPC rate by the number of clicks. This gives you your total revenue. Then divide the total number of impressions by 1,000 to get the number of CPM units. Divide the total revenue by the CPM units and you’ve got your eCPM.\n7. Fill rate\nFill rate is the efficiency of ​delivery of the actual ad ​to the eyes of a user. Fill rate is calculated as the number of ads delivered divided by the number of ads requested.\nDue to various technical issues like poor connectivity or bugs, it’s impossible to have a 100 percent fill rate, but certain services like the company I work for, Adtoapp , ​can provide much more reliable delivery to get as close to 100 percent as possible. This is critical for app makers because when an ad doesn’t get delivered, it doesn’t get paid for either!\n8. CTR, CPC, CPI\nThese are all classic measurements from the online space that apply to mobile apps as well. CTR is ‘click through rate,’ or h​ow many people click a link . ​It’s used to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. CPC is “cost per click” and results on a payment being made from the advertiser to the publisher each time a user clicks through to their content. CPI is “cost per install” and is another way of publishers being paid when one of their users clicks an ad in their app which results in the download and installation of another app.\nDepending on your type of app and your audience, you will probably have to make a decision between CPC and CPM when working with your advertising partners. Advertisers themselves each have their own preferences, depending on what they want their ad to achieve. At AdtoApp we encourage an eCPM approach because it m​aximizes profits for app makers​. Remember this is a combination of CPC and CPM made capable by our advanced delivery software.\n9. DAU, MAU\nAs we talked about above. D​AU​(daily active users) or M​AU​(monthly active users) are a measurement of engagement. With these numbers, the higher the better.\nUsually, an app maker that is starting out will count in MAU, and then as their popularity increases they switch to DAU because, quite frankly, it’s much more impressive. Having these stats at the ready will help with all of your partnership and monetization efforts.\n10. Length of session\nWhile it has much less importance than DAU or LTV, l​ength of session ​will help you segment your users to study how people use your app differently. It’s more helpful for product development than monetization or advertising.\n11. Refresh rate\nThe r​efresh rate ​is h​ow often you deliver a new ad​  to your user. This can range from every 30 seconds to every 180 seconds.\nCommon sense would say to have ads refresh as much as possible, in order to increase revenue. But this can come at the expense of user experience, and so optimization is important. Advertisers also prefer to not have their impressions cut short and to give the user enough time to engage with the ad.\n_______\nRemember: not all apps are created equal. Each app has its own personality, userbase, utility, and potential. Understanding which metrics help you create the best possible experience and monetization strategy is the first step towards global mobile domination.\n", "deleted" : false }

That comes at the same time many developers are enamored with Google’s technical chops, along with some of the technical capabilities of its platform. \n[ Don't miss a thing! Sign up for CIO.com newsletters ]\nGartner Vice President Lydia Leong said that Google is a company that has always had a lot of promise as a public cloud provider, but just hasn’t lived up to it. The company typically positions itself as an innovator, but it’s hard to do that when Amazon is already innovating quickly, and the company’s product catalog isn’t as large as that of its competitors.\n\"I’ve never felt that Google has put the level of effort necessary into this market to be a winner,” she said in an interview. \nWhat’s more, Google hasn’t put as much effort as its competitors into building out an enterprise sales and support force, which is compounded by the fact that the ecosystem of partners built up around Google Cloud Platform isn’t as robust as AWS’s or Microsoft Azure’s. \nDave Bartoletti, a principal analyst at Forrester, said in an email that the biggest challenge facing Google in the cloud wars is proving itself to enterprises. \n\"Cloud is already proven as the best place to quickly build exciting new web and mobile applications, but the next wave of cloud spending will be driven by large enterprises moving significant portions of their applications to the cloud,\" he said in an email. \"To reach these enterprise customers, Google needs marketing, sales, and channels designed to reach big companies, not consumers.\"\nThat change is already in progress. Google hired Diane Greene, the co-founder and ex-CEO of VMware, to take over its business-focused products, including the cloud platform, and she has been pushing to improve the company’s standing with enterprises.\nJack Clark at Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the company is working on growing its enterprise sales channels, and that cloud chief Diane Greene took part in a recent customer meeting with partner SADA Systems. SADA’s CEO reportedly said that was the first time a Google executive of her stature has done so in nine years. \nIf Google can better pitch its services to enterprises and build out additional products, it has tremendous potential behind it. Quizlet, a San Francisco-based education startup, moved all of its infrastructure over to GCP.\nThe company’s pricing schemes (which avoid long-term contracts in favor of discounts for continued use) played a role in Quizlet's decision to move from Joyent, but Quizlet Platform Lead Peter Bakkum said that the ultimate decision came down to a belief that Google’s core technology is better than that of the competition.\nBakkum’s confidence is a key sign of what could be in Google’s future. Urs Hölzle, its senior vice president for technical infrastructure, expects the company’s public cloud business to overtake the advertising revenue that makes up the overwhelming majority of the money Google makes. \nWhat remains to be seen is if the company can live up to that prediction. \nRELATED TOPICS\n", "deleted" : false }

If you’re looking for a Galaxy flagship that delivers some of the same features as the Galaxy S7  – water resistance and a microSD card – Woot via Amazon has a great deal today on the Galaxy S5 .\nFor the next 18 hours, you can buy a certified refurbished Samsung Galaxy S5 16GB (GSM) for just $159.99. That’s a solid 30% off the usual price of this device and a great deal for anyone who wants a brand name device on the cheap.\nNow, the infamous “Band-Aid” texture of the Galaxy S5 hasn’t aged well, especially if you compare it to the sleek glass build of its descendants. But the S5’s specs definitely fared better in the test of time. You’re looking at 5.1-inch Full HD AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 801 processor, 16GB of storage (expandable), 2GB of RAM, a great 16MP camera, a 2800-mAh battery, 1P67 water resistance, and a fingerprint sensor built-in the home button. Not bad at all for $160, even if it’s a refurbished model.\nNote that this is an unlocked GSM model compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile.\nGet a Galaxy S5 16GB GSM (certified refurbished) for $159.99 on Amazon\nWhat does “certified refurbished” mean? Devices with this designation are used devices that have been refurbished and certified to look and work like new. Woot offers a 90-day warranty, but a disclaimer does note that the device “may have minor cosmetic blemishes to the body of the unit and surface scratches on the screen.”\nHappy shopping!\nSounds like a good deal!\nzeth006\nNot a bad deal at all. Unlocked bootloader means you can still enjoy some of the latest roms.\nDaggett Beaver\nI don’t want one, but I can’t think of another phone for $160 that would be comparable.\ngg\nSecond hand Oneplus One or Xiaomi’s 4S? I just bought a second-hand in mint condition Oneplus One for 170 USD.\nDaggett Beaver\nThere’s also the UMI Touch 4G Phablet for $159. The best thing about it is the fingerprint scanner is “Fast as never”.\ngg\nAlthough that device is indeed great, the downside is software support. The Oneplus One has a huge developers support whereas the UMi Touch does not. Plus the UMi Touch has a Mediatek SOC (closed-source) whereas the OPO has a Snapdragon 801 (open-source).\nJerry Rich\nMan did you ever get ripped off. A 2nd hand 1plus1 is only worth $30 bucks.\ngg\nFunny guy, I wanted to make mom joke, but meh. It’s not the day for that.\n1213 1213\nDo these refurbished phones still have used batteries or not?\nWalter Wider Fairyswan\nThere isn’t any s5 at this link…\nJonathan Kramer\nUMMM.. the link shows a phone for $899.. seriously? That’s MORE than the S7! LOL\ngkeli\nit is over.. snif\nDaggett Beaver\nIt says $902 for me — $902 for a Galaxy S5? And not just an S5, but a REFURBISHED S5? Either it’s a joke, or an error, or maybe a way to prevent anyone from actually ordering it.\nJonathan Kramer\nYeah that’s like wacked.. Who would spend $900 on a 2 year old phone in the first place no less a refurbished/used one.

Or zooming into the drive-thru lane and paying with a smartphone instead of a credit card.\nThat's the promise of mobile payments, an emerging technology that will depend greatly on software, hardware chipsets in the phone, and an infrastructure that aids both merchants and consumers.\nIn this case, the word \"emerging\" is important. Some providers, such as Fonwallet.com , are using software to initiate transactions.\nSome, such as Mpayy use text messaging as a way to buy goods on a website or send funds from one user to another.\nMPAYYMENTS: Using text messages to pay for goods\nPhones such as the Nokia 6212 have the capability to conduct transactions using a Near-Field Communication chip, but have not made much progress beyond some early pilots. The chip communicates over a wireless short-range signal for transmitting a small set of data. Nokia pioneered the technology several years ago, and it is popular in some Asian markets.\nNFC in the iPhone?\nThe next iteration of the iPhone and iPad may include an NFC chip , and Apple would likely be poised better than anyone to make it work by tying in mobile payments directly to the iTunes store.\nThink of it this way: Apple could parlay their current ecommerce domination to include physical goods and proximity-based services you buy with a tap of your phone onto a terminal.\nFor now, the only big-name phones prepared for mobile payments is the Google Nexus S and Samsung Galaxy S2, which have an embedded NFC chip.\nAccording to MordyKaplinsky, a co-founder of FonWallet.com , software upgrades for Android have moved towards enabling the mobile payment option on the phone.\nRecently, O2 announced plans to develop an infrastructure for mobile payments where users would be able to store a set amount of money on a phone and transfer funds between other O2 users. Orange and T-Mobile have announced similar plans where an NFC chip is embedded don the SIM card.\nWhat needs to happen\nSo where will that lead? For mobile payments to become a reality, three planets need to align: the NFC chip or some other transaction method has to be on the phone; the infrastructure has to be ready to handle the new transaction method; and software needs to use so-called \"secret\" keys that refresh every few seconds. The keys help reduce fraud if someone tries to hack into a phone.\n\"The top security requirement is to ensure that the user's secret keys are managed in strong tamper-resistant circuitry that is separate from the processors that handle user applications,\" says Paul Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research .\n\"This isolation is critical to prevent identity thieves from extracting and copying payment credentials.\"\nAnother challenge is that the infrastructure will need to support a wide variety of phones. Many Android devices look similar and provide similar features, but the firmware is often quite different: for example, the camera firmware on an HTC phone is different from the firmware used on a Samsung.\n\"[Mobile payment developers] will have to develop applications that run on a wide variety of devices and support a variety of NFC systems including situations where NFC comes built-in to the phone, NFC on the SIM card supplied by the carrier, NFC on a removable card like a MicroSD card,\" says David Eads, a spokesperson for Kony , a company that makes a mobile app platform.\nOne possible answer: Discover Cards has announced a program called ISIS where all of the 7 million terminals on the market would be capable of reading credit card information from a phone when the customer taps it on the terminal.\nThe platform is unique in that Verizon Wireless, AT&T and T-Mobile have all agreed to participate, so the there is a greater chance that the mobile payment system would become ubiquitous and support a variety of phones.\nOne of the best examples of how mobile payments are working is in Japan. The Sony Felica chip is embedded into a phone, and is now commonplace at train stations where smartphone users wave the phone over a terminal to buy a ticket.\nMobile payment vendors can learn a lesson about how the infrastructure developed: the chip started out as a smartcard RFID technology, then made its way onto smartphones. The technology is a joint venture between Sony and DoCoMo.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArticle continues below\nMost-read articles\n", "deleted" : false }

It also announced fresh funding of $1.4 million from a number of angel investors.\nPlacePop wants to replace the clumsy, physical loyalty program cards people carry around in their wallets or forget in their desk drawers. So it’s joining   a lot of companies doing the same thing — helping people go virtual with their loyalty cards. It’s not clear whether PlacePop really can differentiate itself in such a crowded market.\nThe San Francisco company, led by former Friendster CEO Kent Lindstrom, today began offering cards that can be accessed with smartphones — and you can do this from shop or a restaurant while “checking in” at that location. In an effort to differentiate itself, PlacePop says it is giving businesses a lot of control over their campaigns, allowing them to customize the branding and look of their virtual card as well as its functionality.\nThe funding, first reported by TechCrunch , comes from Affinity Labs founder Chris Michel, Bebo Founder Michael Birch, James Currier and Stan Chudnovsky.\nI spoke with Lindstrom, and he said the funding could last for a year, depending on how things go. The company’s full platform will launch in beta within the next two weeks, he said, and the company is working on an Android app to follow the iPhone launch.\nLindstrom said the company is “really focused on making sure [they] have the tool right for small businesses”, and, building on that, PlacePop will be targeting big brands and retailers. Lindstrom said that the company has already been picking up interest from the big retailers and restaurant chains.\nAI. Messaging. Bots. Arm yourself for the next paradigm shift at MobileBeat 2016.

We have no further comment at this time. Further updates will be provided as appropriate.\"\nYahoo reportedly has held discussions with Verizon, IAC/Interactive Corp. and CBS Corp., according to the WSJ, but has not yet sat down with Daily Mail executives. Verizon, whose CEO confirmed interest in acquiring Yahoo's core Web business several weeks ago, is widely seen as the leading candidate to pull off a deal .\nYahoo has extended the deadline for receipt of first-round bids from April 11 to April 18, according to reports.\nThe Daily Mail is the latest surprise entrant in the contest. Its bid could take the form of one or two potential deals, the WSJ noted.\nIn one scenario, the private equity partner would take over Yahoo's entire U.S. operation and fold the news and media properties into the Daily Mail. The second scenario would have the private equity partner take control of Yahoo and fold its news and media companies into a new firm, which would include DailyMail.com and Elite Daily.\nThe Daily Mail has been in talks with a half-dozen private equity firms on making a bid, including General Atlantic, according to the WSJ.\nPlenty to Offer\nDespite Yahoo's difficulties as a legacy company, there remains a strong core of Web traffic that might attract traditional media company like the Daily Mail, observed Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at Poynter .\n\"Say what you will about Yahoo,they remain a leader in basic traffic,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"The rap on the company is that they cannot come up with a growth strategy or carve out a distinctive journalistic role.\"\nThe Daily Mail claims about 62 million unique visitors per month in the U.S., citing Comscore data from July 2015.\nYahoo reaches nearly 78 million people per month, making it the ninth biggest website in the country, according to Quantcast.\nYahoo has beefed up its content business over the years, luring major media figures like former CBS anchor Katie Couric, who is global anchor at Yahoo, and former Newsweek investigative reporter Michael Isikoff, who is now the company's chief investigative correspondent.\n\"The news and financial features are good and what makes Yahoo attractive to media companies,\" said Michael Jude, consumer communication services research manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan .\nYahoo's once-leading search engine probably would be folded into another entity, as it is not what it used to be before Google emerged as a leading search provider, he added.\nHowever, the likely scenario is that whichever company acquires Yahoo, it will wind up with the company largely intact, Jude suggested, because the individual parts by themselves are not as attractive.\nIdentity Crisis\n\"What exactly is Yahoo these days? A media company, a personal destination page, a news source, a 22-year-old startup?\" asked Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research .\n\"A case can be made for all of these and none of these,\" he told the E-Commerce Times.\nDefining what Yahoo's mission actually is has \"stymied its management since the leadership of cofounder Jerry Yang, and therefore made the company both malleable and cast hard,\" Krewell said.\n\"Each potential buyer can see it in their own light, but whichever company does get Yahoo will try to mold it to a new owner's whims,\" he predicted. \"It will be hard, and some things will break, and some parts will be sold off.\"\nYahoo will have no comment on the deal process, spokesperson Rebecca Neufeld told the E-Commerce Times -- either regarding the Daily Mail specifically or in general.\nDavid Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

His new startup, Seattle-based DigitalScirocco , is emerging from pseudo-stealth mode today at the semi-annual DEMO conference in Palm Desert, CA. The company’s service has been live for a couple of months, but has been kept pretty quiet.\nIt’s a big vision, and here’s how it works. Right now, if you’re a publisher or website owner and you want to post outside content on your site—an article, photo, or song, say—you have to go to a source like Getty Images, or a media organization, and either buy the content manually, arrange to pay them through a business development process, or agree on some other deal. DigitalScirocco has set up an automated marketplace for connecting these website owners with content owners. Through an online auction process, websites can pay for the kinds of content they want—and discover the kinds of prices they want—while DigitalScirocco gets a piece of each sale.\nA dress designer, for example, might want to automatically post some relevant articles from Vogue on its site to make it stickier and help drive traffic. The idea is that DigitalScirocco would help the designer get a good price on fresh content, and also would help Vogue make more money from its articles—all by connecting Web publishers with content owners in a new way.\n“The issue right now is, those connections are broken, in part because everyone has lost their way in the illusions that [website] locations are content and monetization is about advertising,” says D’Ambrosio, the company’s founder and CEO.\nHe stresses that DigitalScirocco is not directly interested in the advertising part of the equation. It’s not an ad network. Rather, the company is trying to help enhance websites so they can give consumers a better experience, while helping content producers—media organizations, entertainment sites, finance sites—make more money.

Chris Dannen Design\nDate of Publication: 10.23.14.\nTime of Publication: 6:30 am.\n6:30 am\nHow Box Plans to Use Design to Beat Microsoft (And Everyone Else)\nBox CEO Aaron Levie\nAriel Zambelich / WIRED\nIn the nine months since Satya Nadella took over as CEO of Microsoft, the company has been getting unprecedented love from Office 365 users and Wall Street alike. Meanwhile, Box CEO Aaron Levie, one of Microsoft’s perennial detractors, has been quiet. But not because he’s been sulking. He was busy looking for Ethan Batraski.\nBatraski is Box’s new vice president of design, and according to Levie, finding him was a year-long process. He’s the company’s first design executive, and it’s a critical hire. Batraski, who previously led user experience for Yahoo! search, will oversee Box’s entire product portfolio.\nHis mandate is to bring new focus to the usability of Box’s apps, looking at the needs of individual users for design insights instead of simply trying to serve organizations in the abstract. It may seem like an obvious approach, but Batraski says it’s largely absent in the enterprise world. “Design hasn’t even been a conversation in enterprise software until now,” he explains. “Enterprise can become a lot more human-focused. The ROI on what we’re doing, in terms of organizational efficiency, is almost incalculable.” Eventually, it could mean a broader mission for Box as a company, one that looks beyond file sharing to collaboration more broadly.\nEthan Bartraski\nBox\nSeams in the Workflow\nWhen Batraski talks about improving efficiency in the enterprise world, he isn’t talking about how apps look but rather how they work. At home, we blithely send files between programs and computers, often directly via open APIs that help different apps communicate. Legacy enterprise programs mostly don’t integrate with one another, so much of the data-moving that drives today’s businesses is done manually. This creates seams in the workflow: points where information can get lost, delayed, mis-typed, stolen or destroyed.\nTake a worker in an oil field responsible for inspecting equipment every day. His job starts with a clipboard full of forms. Back in the office, he enters the data into a computer, burns the files onto a CD, and mails it to a home office. That office analyzes the data on the disc, crafts a response plan, burns it onto a CD, and mails it back. Then the field worker acts on it.\nAs Batraski sees it, each of those steps is a potential seam, and part of his new post is figuring out how to smooth them over. “We’re talking about making something that’s 46 steps into just a few,” he explains.\nRedesigning for the Real World\nUntil now, Box was mostly designing for general use cases: sharing files, collaborating on documents. As part of the new effort, Box designers will be dig into labor-intensive real-world jobs like that of the oil worker, looking for the points of friction and tedium. Then, they’ll try to find solutions that can be incorporated into the design of Box’s applications at large.\nFor Box, it’s a play at becoming something more like a true platform than infrastructural piping. It could help move Box down the value chain, closer to the end user. The trouble will be figuring out how to translate specific observations from real world jobs into universal improvements to how Box’s apps work. “The excruciatingly hard part of this is, you’re solving complex business problems that are very hard to abstract from the UX,” Levie says. The solution might look something like enterprise darling Slack . At heart, it’s a well-designed chat app, but it also cleverly incorporates other services that employees rely on, like Twitter and Google Docs. Creating apps that serve as hubs, instead of specific tools, might be one way to eliminate some of those seams.\nTo make all this happen, Batraski has formed bigger design teams within Box and aggressively shortened design cycles. “The team works like a mini agency, where you get the benefit of having seven to nine designers to help solve a problem up-front,” he explains. He’s also encouraged his designers to let emotion play a bigger part in guiding their work, and to take a more empathetic approach to understanding customers’ needs. “We live their problems, like how an actor trains for a movie,” Batraski says. Ultimately, the idea is to create something like the design studio at Apple, which puts designers in a concentrated group, as opposed to an approach like Google’s, in which designers are seeded throughout the company. The hope is that this core group will be able to create models for interaction that can be used throughout Box’s products.\nStill, enterprise sales cycles are long, so it could be years before the bet pays off, if it ever does. “We’re going to try to push the whole industry forward,” says Levie. “We’re thinking of what the future of design could be. It’s a long term project.”\nBut Box thinks tectonic changes in the enterprise software market are working in their favor. Put simply, these days people expect technology to be easy to use.\n“Before, the sales process was very different,” says Batraski, who sold his own enterprise startup, Adchemy, to Walmart earlier this year. “It was about solutions, with no consideration about how the end user felt. Nobody was asking: How often do they want to throw the monitor at the wall?” he says. “Now you have your iPhone, your Macbook. Your expectations have elevated so much in the consumer experience that it has become the de facto standard.”\n", "deleted" : false }

My partner Brad literally wrote the book about this (highly recommended if you haven’t read it already). But the very quick summary is that great entrepreneurial communities are build on the basis of a few key tenets (Brad writes about these in much more detail in the book, which – again – you should read)\n– Startup Communities Take Time. Think 20 years. And they don’t happen overnight (despite what you may have heard about Boulder – it took plenty of time to develop here too).\n– Startup Communities Are Led by Entrepreneurs. For some reason I still can’t figure out, many VCs get this backwards . But great entrepreneurial communities are led by entrepreneurs.\n– Startup Communities Have Many Leaders And Are Not Hirearchical. Related to being led by entrepreneurs, great entrepreneurial ecosystems have many leaders. They don’t need to be working in a coordinated fashion (but see the next point on being inclusive) but they do need to be working for the greater good of the community. Additionally these communities are meshed in their network structure vs being hub and spoke or centralized. There’s no hierarchy in strong entrepnreurial communities.\n– Startup Communities Are Open. It’s pretty critical in any startup community to be open and welcoming. People come to entrepreneurship from lots of different background and bring different perspectives. They’re also working across the stack of petential problems and forming companies that are varied in their make-up, focus and goals.\nIt’s funny. I thought for sure I had written about this before, but when I looked it turned out I hadn’t. Brad has some great content up (in addition to his book, which I’ve now mentioned 3 times that you really should read). There are a few videos up (see here and here ) where I touch on these topics if you’re interested in digging deeper (they’re long but it’s a meaty topic…). Felt like it was worth prefacing the rest of this post with these thoughts on Entrepnreurial Ecosystems and Startup Communities First.\nSo how does Entrepreneurial Density have to do with this? I’m starting to develop a thesis around the ways in which Entrepreneurial Communities follow something pretty akin to Boyles Law. For those of you that have forgotten high school chemistry, Boyles Law describes the behavior of gasses – it describes how the pressure of gas increases as the volume decreases.\nStartup Commnunities can behave in a very similar fashion. The smaller the physical space in which entrepreneurial activities are taking place, the faster those activities happen, the more serendipity emerges and the more that community thrives. This often happens somewhat naturally – startups like to be around other startups for example. But they can also be encouraged to happen – co-working spaces are good examples of systems trying to create density; sometimes enterprise zones can create this effect, often a group in a particular city gets together and consciously tries to create an area of town that’s particularly attractive to startups. I lived this in Boulder without really realizing at the time what was going on. In 2007 Foundry moved from an office park on the highway to the west side of town. There were already a number of startups there (our office formerly belonged to Rally Software, Lijit Networks was upstairs, many more companies were nearby). We moved there because we liked the location and it was near to where 2 of the Foundry partners lived. Over time more and more companies moved to that side of town and we built a little bit of a community within a community where people were constantly bumping into each other on the street, getting coffee, at lunch, etc. In our building alone we’ve had about a dozen portfolio companies have an office at one time or another.\nTo be clear, it’s not that density is required to build a great entrepreneurial ecosystem (and I feel passionately about the virtual community that’s connecting entrepnreurs around the work – perhaps with this new lens, creating virtual density as well). But community building is about creating the environment that allows for the entire system to thrive and creating density in a community is an important way to help speed up that process.\nAn important credit to end this post. I first starting thinking about density a number of years ago when Brad Burnham mentioned it to me. I doubt he remembers that specific conversation but, like many conversations I’ve had with Brad over the years, it was an impactful one. \n", "deleted" : false }

In anticipation of the return digital analytics shop Amobee used their Brand Intelligence platform to provide exclusive data to Found Remote on the show.\nThe company analyzed the show and came to a number of interesting conclusions. One of those conclusions was that 5% of all the show’s digital content engagement was related to the NFL (there are a few celebrity former players this season), while 3% of all NFL digital content engagement was related to Dancing With The Stars, which is an interesting tidbit for a League with a male-heavy fanbase.\nSVP of Brand Intelligence, Assaf Henkin, explained, “With a steady stream of the show’s contestants from the NFL, Dancing With The Stars has become a powerful platform for the NFL to extend their brand’s presence and reach more women.” Here are the full insights:\nThere has been 316% more digital content engagement around Dancing With The Stars the week the full cast of Season 22 was announced compared to the week that the full cast of Season 21 was announced; comparing March 7-13, 2016 to August 31- September 6, 2015.\nBecause of Fuller House recently debuted on Netflix, along with the boost from Miley’s Instagram diss, since the full cast of Dancing With The Stars was first announced (March 8 -14, 2016), there has been the most Dancing With The Stars related digital content engagement around Jodie Sweetin\nMischa Barton, former star from “The O.C.”, generated 14% as much Dancing With The Stars related digital content engagement\nSuper Bowl MVP Von Miller generated 7% as much Dancing With The Stars related digital content engagement as Jodie Sweetin.\nIn the same time period, Donald Trump’s ex-wife Marla Maples generated 6% as much as much Dancing With The Stars related digital content engagement as Jodie Sweetin;\nPittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown also receiving 6% as much Dancing With The Stars related digital content engagement as Jodie Sweetin.\nSince the full roster of Season 22 was announced looking between March 8 -14, 2016, there have been 10,827 Tweets around Von Miller; meaning he’s the early audience favorite to win the Mirror Ball trophy. In the same time period, there have been 7,218 Tweets around Antonio Brown; 5,617 Tweets around Jodie Sweetin; 3,096 Tweets around actress Kim Fields, and 3,060 Tweets around UFC fighter Paige VanZant.\nWinning on Dancing With The Stars can help your career of course, but you’re not going to win Dancing With The Stars in the first place without a pre-existing fan base to vote for you. Looking at last season’s winner Bindi Irwin, in the 12 weeks after she won Dancing With The Stars compared to 12 weeks before she went on the show digital content engagement around her only increased by 26%; meaning looking at December 7, 2015 - February 28, 2016 compared to June 22, 2015 - September 13, 2015.

It helps organize trends and themes that otherwise cut across swaths of different industries.\nConsider the wide range of mobile entrepreneurs in the Boston area. There are well-established mini-clusters around mobile advertising, marketing, and enterprise apps. There’s a burgeoning mobile health scene. Not as well known are some efforts around consumer-mobile interfaces for existing niche markets.\nI’ve recently met with several experienced startup folks working on new mobile interfaces for online shopping, e-reading, and professional networking. If there’s a common theme, it’s around next-generation communication tools being used to augment mainstream digital technologies. And the stories of these entrepreneurs—and how they think about their niches—are at least as interesting as what they’re actually building.\nTake Industry , a mobile app (still in beta) being developed by Raj Bala and Subra Aswathanarayanan. At first you think, “Please, not another niche social network.” But bear with them for a minute.\nThe founders are both ex-EMC employees. That’s interesting in itself, as the data storage giant has a rep for not churning out many startup founders. (That might be changing.) Bala actually has left EMC (NYSE: EMC ) twice to do startups. The first one was BigSwerve, an online comment aggregator that was bought by Lijit Networks. The second time, most recently, almost led him to develop something like “IMDb for Bollywood,” he says.\nThe idea didn’t pan out, sadly, and Bala and his co-founder went in a different direction, in pursuit of an answer to a simple question: “If LinkedIn were invented today, what would it be?”\nCambridge, MA-based Industry’s goal is to create an app that is “like walking into a hotel lobby of your peers,” says Bala (pictured). It’s like what you’d experience at an industry trade show, for example. Roughly speaking, they want to create an experience that sits between LinkedIn and Twitter, all from a mobile-first perspective, and lets workers in specific industries talk to each other, ask questions, and network with others in their field.\nThis doesn’t really exist yet, though there’s still plenty of competition. As Bala puts it, LinkedIn isn’t a communication platform; it’s mostly for connecting with people you already know (and mostly useful for recruiters). When the Industry founders were at EMC, most of their LinkedIn connections were with other EMC people—not that useful. Meanwhile, Twitter isn’t great for professional networking, though expert users can make it work; it’s more of a mainstream media-sharing and commenting platform, and it’s very noisy.\n“We see ourselves as being in business to tear down walls between people,” Bala says. So he actually thinks of Industry as being “the inverse of LinkedIn,” in that communication comes first.\nIndustry is still in private beta trials, and its focus so far is on the high-tech industry. But its founders have plans to branch out into life sciences, K-12 education, and eventually other sectors such as healthcare and oil and gas. (And who knows, maybe a premium version for Bollywood?)\nThe company, which got started in February and is self-funded, has a long way to go to overcome people’s reluctance to sign up for (and maintain) a new messaging service. But if it can fill an important hole for users in their jobs and careers, word could spread quickly, so stay tuned.\nMeanwhile, a bit further along but also early is Vioby , a mobile e-commerce startup that’s using speech technology, natural language processing, and other “intelligence built in to emulate a good salesperson.”\nThat’s according to co-founder Mike Krasner, a longtime veteran of BBN Technologies (fka Bolt, Beranek and Newman) who has led five tech startups including InTouch Systems (acquired by Comverse in 1999) and Oxy Systems. His first startup was a BBN subsidiary in Edinburgh in the late ‘80s. (Of haggis, he says, “it’s good.”) He’s also married to Jean Hammond, a prominent angel investor and education tech advocate.\nKrasner (pictured) gave me a quick demo on an Android phone. Say you’re shopping for shoes on Zappos. You can speak into the phone, “I’m looking for men’s dress shoes in black or brown.” Up pops the portion of the catalog that answers to that description. Then you can ask questions like, “What’s on sale for under 200 dollars?” to narrow the list down further. Or if you’re looking at golf shoes, you can pare down the selection by style, brand, or other features.\nThe software uses Google’s off-the-shelf speech recognition and integrates store catalogs such as Zappos (Vioby signed up as an affiliate). The tricky part is figuring out what the user is trying to do or look for, when he or she might not actually know. That’s the main difference between this technology and something like Apple’s Siri, or other goal-directed virtual assistants.\n“It’s not a search, it’s a conversation,” Krasner says.\nBut it’s still very early. Vioby (vee-OH-bee), which has a half-dozen full-timers, is targeting retailers and brands that have their own mobile apps as early customers. The idea is to layer the smart-assistant technology on top of existing apps and online catalogs to enhance them, Krasner says. Down the road, he and his co-founder Alec Belfer might also create stand-alone apps or tools for retail sales associates to quickly take inventory (for office supplies, say).\nOne thing that Krasner and Bala from Industry have in common is they’re using mobile interfaces to go after a market they have … Next Page »\nGregory T.

He co-founded the company in 2012 with Rob Gonzalez and Jeremy Redburn. The trio previously worked together at Cambridge, MA-based Endeca, the enterprise search and e-commerce technology company acquired by Oracle in 2011 for over $1 billion .\nI recently sat down with Purcell , who grew up in Dallas, at Salsify’s headquarters in downtown Boston. We covered Salsify’s aspirations, his thoughts on the latest “Star Wars” flick, his guilty pleasure TV show, and more. Read on for highlights of our conversation.\nXconomy: Salsify was one of the fastest-growing tech companies in the Boston area last year. Can we expect that to continue?\nJason Purcell: Yeah, it’s been pretty significant growth. I think you have to take those numbers with a grain of salt. Sometimes it’s more a reflection of how much you’re spending than how much you’re growing.\nWe were at 30 people at the beginning of [2015], and we exited it at 80. We’re going to cross 100 here sometime in the next month.\nX: What’s occupying most of your time right now?\nJP: Given the rate of growth, a lot of my personal time gets sucked into people. I have a really good operating team. My executive team works well together, and they’re running the company fantastically. A lot of my time is around people, culture, where are we making mistakes.\nIf we hire someone and really like them, [and they leave], what could we have done better? … How do we onboard people faster?\nThat’s a huge part of where my time goes. And the rest of it tends to go into thinking about where does the product and the company need to be two, three years out. Who’s outflanking us?\nBut it’s surprising how much the people time takes. I remember that at some point, I was talking with Pete Bell, one of the co-founders of Endeca, and Rob [Gonzalez]. And he mentioned we had just crossed 50 [employees]. Pete was like, “That’s when all the high school drama starts.” He’s totally right. At 50, you get just big enough where if you’re not focused on it, it’s too easy for people to form into cliques. I don’t want that to happen. It’s a constant battle, but it’s got to be done.\nI’d never been an entrepreneur [before Salsify]. It was not a particular desire. Finishing up at Oracle, I didn’t know what else to do.\nI look at some of the folks in the area who have been successful [entrepreneurs], and I have completely new appreciation for what they’ve been able to do. Folks like [Endeca co-founder and CEO] Steve Papa, you saw him doing it and you were too naïve to appreciate what he was pulling off behind the scenes. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from this, it’s a much deeper appreciation for what it takes to be successful.\nX: You studied biology in college, but haven’t worked in that field. Are you able to apply anything from that degree in your career?\nJP: Taking courses like organic chemistry, it was all about problem solving, about solving puzzles. The problem-solving aspect is probably the one piece that carries over. Obviously the domain is completely irrelevant.\nX: In past articles , we’ve talked about how one of Salsify’s long-term goals is to change the way products are designed and developed, by enabling manufacturers and retailers to collaborate on products via the cloud. How close are you to achieving that vision?\nJP: It’s less sort of about developing them. There’s a whole ecosystem around developing products. The part that blows my mind is there’s a whole digital supply chain that needs to exist for you and I to shop online. It’s not enough for the product to be drop-shipped to your door. If you want to buy it, you have to get great content about that product integrated with the experience on the buying side.\nThat process … was so stupidly broken. Even today it’s still a sales rep filling out a spreadsheet and sending it to a big retailer, like a Target. It’s crazy.\nThe vision [of Salsify] was why can’t we take the friction out of it? Why can’t a Mondelez take new pictures of one of their products, an Oreo, and press a button, and have that show up on Walmart.com and show up within minutes. Why can’t that happen? A big chunk of it was the lack of a big technology platform to facilitate it.\nI think it changes the way brands are able to interact with the end consumer. If they’re able to … get in front of you and I faster and are able to get insights into how you and I are interacting with brands … it makes it easier for the shoppers .\nBrands are eager for it. They’re still figuring out what e-commerce means to them. It’s still relatively small. They’re still doing most of their business through Amazon, through Walmart, through Target, through marketplaces. But they’re getting better and better.\nI think we have a chance to transform and take the friction out of that whole supply chain. Again, it’s embarrassing how much farther we have to go to get there. But the early signs are very positive. We were very fortunate to acquire some really recognizable names early on as customers.\nX: What’s your end game with Salsify?\nJP: This [market] is such a rich vein. It really is. There’s not a brand or retailer in the world that doesn’t struggle with this problem. This whole area of product content is crucial to the consumer interacting with products digitally. Nobody who has ever tried to tackle this in the past has ever been able to do it at the scale we’re imagining. They’ve had hundreds of customers. We’re imagining thousands and thousands of customers.\nWhen we hit that kind of scale, something transforms. An ecosystem emerges. Whether it’s us or a company like us, somebody is going to emerge and become a dominant player.\n[We] could turn it into what CRM was 15 years ago. Think about Salesforce. Salesforce was incredibly innovative, but nobody was thinking CRM was sexy. They transformed it. I don’t mean to suggest that our category is going to be that big. But also I think it’s a lot bigger than most naive observers give it credit. … How do we enable product content as a service, and what does that unveil? No doubt this gives us the ability and the headroom to be one of Boston’s next $1 billion companies.\nWe’re fortunate to have investors that invested in places like HubSpot, Demandware, and Acquia. There are some nice precedents here, and I think it’s in our control whether or not we hit those heights. But the market is certainly going to allow us to.\nX: Where are you most productive?\nJP: For work, here actually, especially in the morning when it’s early and just a handful of folks are here. That’s when I can get a lot of stuff done. Usually by 4, 5 o’clock, I’m hitting the wall and I need to go for a run. And that’s when I … Next Page »\n", "deleted" : false }

When you put on the Apple Watch you enter in your security pin, then as long as the Apple Watch knows it is still in contact with the wrist, you don't have to enter in the pin again.\nThis feature makes using the Apple Watch to pay for things via Apple Pay more convenient, but it's also open to exploits.\nBait and switch\nWhen the sensor detects that the wrist is no longer in contact with the Apple Watch, the wearable locks itself, requiring you to enter in a pin next time you wear it. If someone removes it from your wrist and puts it on themselves, they will need to enter in that pin.\nHowever it was discovered that there are two weaknesses to Apple's implementation; the first is that the sensor takes about a second to detect that it's not being touched by the wrist. While this means that it doesn't accidentally lock itself when the Apple Watch moves when being worn, it does provide thieves with a window – no matter how slight.\nThe other weakness is that the sensor cannot differentiate between a wrist and a finger, so someone could steal the Apple Watch and then place a finger over the sensor to keep it from being locked.\nThe thief could then use your Apple Watch to pay for things without having to enter in any pin. The blogger at WonderHowTo posted a video on how this flaw could be exploited.\nAs you can see from the video it is tricky to pull off, and will be very difficult to perform without the wearer noticing, but it is possible.\nWe also tried the method here and can confirm that it does work (don't worry, we returned the Apple Watch to its owner afterwards).\nAlthough you might be concerned that by posting a video on how to do this will simply teach thieves the trick, it should hopefully bring the issue to the attention of Apple, who could eliminate the risk by reducing the time the sensor takes to notice it's not attached to the wrist, or by replacing it with a more sophisticated device in the next model.\nUntil then, be extra weary and if your Apple Watch does get stolen make sure you cancel any cards connected to the device to be on the safe side.\n", "deleted" : false }

This week, build 10036 has leaked. Perhaps its most interesting new feature? It'll support peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading of both apps and operating system updates.\nPeer-to-peer downloads will be optional, and if enabled they will support two modes: systems will be able to either retrieve updates from other machines on the same local network, or from both the local network and PCs on the Internet.\nWith Windows moving to a model that sees Microsoft releasing more updates more often, this is a natural addition. While not a problem faced by enterprise deployments, having multiple Windows systems in the home tends to make updating rather bandwidth hungry. Every machine on a network needs to download updates itself, and with major updates sometimes weighing in at several gigabytes, this can waste a lot of time and, for those on metered connections, burn through the precious bandwidth allowance.\nEnterprises have been able to avoid this wastage through WSUS (Windows Server Update Services), which downloads the updates once to a local update server. Machines then use this as the source of their patches.\nIt's not immediately clear what technology is used for the peer-to-peer patching. Windows has included its own P2P API since Windows XP Service Pack 1, but this API appears to be used by little or no software. In 2013, Microsoft bought Pando Networks , a company developing BitTorrent-like P2P software that included dedicated servers and smart bandwidth throttling. This would feel like a natural fit for Windows patch distribution.\n", "deleted" : false }

The service tracks popular content around the Web by mixing user searches with voting to promote stories to the front page.\nAs an added incentive to get on the site, Yahoo's taking a handful of the most popular stories from Buzz and putting them on the front page of Yahoo.com, a move that will send a lot of traffic to smaller sites where the content is being hosted.\nWhile the service seems to lack some of the community hooks other social news services like Digg and Reddit offer, Buzz has an ace up its sleeve by providing related stories, which for the most part are pretty spot-on.

While on the surface it appears as a social news site, there's no commenting system or any way to share what you've voted on with others. Unlike Netscape's Propeller , which did its best to emulate Digg, Buzz can continue to operate without human intervention. Speaking of which, there's no real upcoming section per se. You can locate stories with less buzz and promote them, but a certain amount of buzz is already given to stories that have been given some search love, making users dig deeper to reach the smaller stories.\nIf Yahoo was looking to take a chunk out of social news space, Buzz doesn't seem to be the answer. While the site is useful, Buzz is actually competing with sites like TechMeme , NewsPond , Spotplex , and Blogrunner when it comes to tracking the newest and most popular stories.

It syncs with major cloud providers to monitor websites and servers from a single console, API and mobile app, thus offering the ability to diagnose problems and maintain uptime and server performance. It works both on-premise and via the cloud.\nThe company makes money by charging a monthly fee based on the number of systems monitored. In terms of traction, Server Density claims to monitor over 300TB of data per month for its 1000+ customers. Specifically, it says it will be investing in key product areas such as enhancing its big data analytics function to “leverage the billions of metrics data it collects daily.”\nCo-founder David Mytton tells me that the company’s clients include the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), for whom it monitors the 999 emergency response systems for the country’s ambulance service. The open source CMS company Drupal also uses Server Density to monitor the servers powering its online community, and Algolia is another customer, using the SaaS to monitor their hosted search API.\nHe cites competitors as New Relic, which focuses on application performance rather than infrastructure, and Datadog. There are also numerous competitors that have been acquired, including Stack Driver (Google), Pingdom and Librato (SolarWinds), CopperEgg, and Boundary (BMC).\nIn a statement Mytton says: “I’m excited about this new round because it will allow us to invest in key areas while still maintaining the efficient, bootstrapped model that got us to where we are today. Raising money at this stage means we can continue our own style of running the business but with added resources to build an even better product.”\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Zenoss will host    a webinar to cover the key findings on Wednesday, November 11 at 11    a.m. CST.\nThe full report will be available for download to all webinar attendees    but the live discussion will discuss the data center transformation that    is underway, including:\nWhat trends are driving adoption of Converged Infrastructure?\nWhat commonalities exist between those companies having the greatest     success in deploying Converged Infrastructure?\nHow are companies structuring their IT workforce to best manage CI     deployments?\n“Our survey results revealed that organizations using converged    infrastructures are failing to achieve full benefits by monitoring    separate components instead of treating the CI as a coherent single    product,” said Kent Erickson, Technology Strategist at Zenoss.    “Converged infrastructure solutions allow customers to purchase a data    center with compute, storage, and network resources as a single,    standard product. With 84% of all respondents using or planning to    deploy CI, the technology has reached mainstream status for the way    modern, elastic data centers need to be built.”\nThe 2015 CI survey provides many additional insights into data center    modernization, including:\nIn companies with more than 5,000 employees, only 8% are not using or     considering CI.\nDespite being pervasively adopted, the survey results indicate     management software is lagging behind, with 63% of respondents     indicating they manage their CI deployments by repurposing existing     management tools designed for traditional infrastructure.\nAstonishingly, 25% of companies who have deployed CI are dealing with     seven or more tools to manage it.\nKey drivers for CI deployments include projects for big data,     infrastructure as a service, unified communications, and custom     application development.\n“The best business benefits reported come from organizations that    automate their IT processes on top of a converged infrastructure    foundation,” reported Erickson. “Organizations focusing on a CI platform    with automated provisioning tools are able to deploy applications in    minutes instead of months. Zenoss customers benefit from standard    integrations with each of the top seven commercial CI provisioning    tools.”\nSURVEY METHODOLOGY\nZenoss polled 410 IT professionals from across the world to determine    how technology leaders are leveraging CI to respond to business needs.    This was up from 183 in 2014, including 151 who have already adopted CI    within their IT environments and another 194 who were currently    considering or planning for it. Thirty-two percent of these respondents    come from organizations with more than 5,000 employees.\nAdditional Resources\n", "deleted" : false }

Now there’s a new entrant in the category: Bizroof is offering free accounts for their hosted offering, which handles a good chunk of tracking functionality. Their FAQ says that there will free accounts, though they may have limits (and details on paid accounts are not yet available).\nBizroof handles storing and cross-referencing a bunch of basics for anyone doing business: contacts and their organizations, events, documents, users, and tags. After creating an account, you’ll find yourself with immediate links to actions you can take: adding contacts and organizations, creating events, adjusting your preferences and so on. From there, your first stop is your account dashboard, which offers an overview of what’s been going on as well as deeper links.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIt takes very little data entry to create things in Bizroof. Adding a person, for example, asks for their name, organization, and tags. You can add more details, such as phone numbers, web sites, and addresses, later. Although you can associate one contact with multiple instances of the supplied data (for example, multiple emails per contact) you can’t create your own data entry fields. Most things you create can also be set public (for anyone in your organization to see) or private (to your own account).\nAdvertisement\nAfter creating contacts and organizations, you can add tags, notes, and events to them. These are easily viewed from their parent pages, but are also available collected – you can see all events on a calendar, or search for anything by tag. In addition, your dashboard keeps a running list of what’s gone on with your account, and also makes it available as an RSS feed. There are also specific RSS feed for events, contacts, and so on, so you can focus on what’s important to you at any level.\nAdvertisement\nThere are some other nice interoperability touches here: you can download a vCard for a contact, or an ics (iCal-format) file for an event. Bizroof also does document management – you can upload documents and tag them for easier finding, though you can’t associate them directly with other entities. Bizroof uses Amazon S3 for backups.\nAdvertisement\nThe service has a nice clean design, and the price (for now, at least) is hard to beat. The only major drawbacks I see in this initial release is that their server seems to be a bit slow, and there’s no information yet on what the plans and limits will be. But as an easily shareable system that covers the basics, it’s worth a look.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

The company’s total funding since it was founded in 2004 is now nearly $40 million.\nEnlarge\nGerald A. Michaud, president of Horizon, told Mass High Tech that this is his firm’s first investment in Optaros. Many of the people involved in the February equity investment are known to him and his firm, and he said he trusts their belief in the company.\nHe said many companies opt for debt financing over equity, which offers smaller ownership in exchange for higher priority for repayment.\n“Debt itself may be just enough to get them up to profitability,” he said. “At the end of the day, you’re lowering the cost of capital.”\nOptaros adapts new technologies in online commerce, providing its e-commerce services to grow online businesses for such companies including Walmart, Macy’s, Puma, Bloomingdales.com and 20th Century FOX Home Entertainment.\nRobert Willms, president and CEO of Optaros, said in a written statement that Optaros is entering its “next phase of growth as a digital commerce service provider,” and the loan from Horizon will allow them “to accelerate (their) long-term growth potential within this growing market.”\nDon Seiffert writes about the life sciences industry, including biotech, the drug industry, medical devices and diagnostics.\nBizspace Spotlight\n", "deleted" : false }

Beyond that it also offers speed dating (Mobiflirt) and a picture dating product (Mobimodels). - Mark Brooks\nHow much can dating companies make with mobile dating?\nPay-outs vary a lot depending on the country, regulations and the operator pay outs. In North America and Europe we get  15 to 33 Euros of average revenue per user (ARPU), generated over the course of 3 to 4 months average user lifetime. The carriers take a cut of 40% to 70%. Carrier cuts in Europe are less aggressive than in America. The ARPU also depends on the country. Some countries have very strict regulations on the way you can price and bill customers while most leave it to us.\nWhat factors should dating companies consider in their selection of mobile dating enabler?\nThe experience and commitment of the mobile dating company is most important. The experience because there are lots of hurdles and regulations that can knock you over in different countries. Look at the international track record of the partner. Plutolife has rolled out mobile community services in 22 countries. And that’s something that is not easy to do because you’re talking multiple languages, different cultures and a wide range of technical capability. Your mobile dating partner needs to know how to deal with multiple networks per country and multiple billing systems per country. The last thing, and tough thing is understanding the cultural differences because you want to run the most efficient marketing campaign in every country.\nWhat branding and advertising strategies have been successful in the past for you?\nHaving a strong online brand will make it relatively easy to convince mobile operators to provide a good position on their mobile Internet pages. However, “off deck,” activity is becoming increasingly important and lucrative. We create many simplified WAP versions of a web portal specific to mobile community installations. For advertising, you’re TV and radio on youth oriented TV stations. You’re talking web advertising, Google ads, banners, other search engines, etc. What is on the decrease, we’ve noticed, is the “quick print ad.” The return of these kinds of investments is going down. Consumers are now looking for new types of marketing stimulation.\nAlso, there are a range of advertising opportunities specific to each country in Europe. For instance, in most Scandinavian countries Teletext is usually efficient. If you know how to play with it, it’s one of the most profitable advertising investments you can make. In Ireland and the UK, I didn’t believe teletext would be as good as in Scandinavia but it looks like it is. In Southern Europe teletext doesn’t really fly but other media like print seems to be more efficient than in Northern Europe. We have tried radio and TV focused on local markets, if possible, or focused on youth markets. MTV is a good example. We have bought several thousand spots on MTV in Scandinavia, Norway and Sweden and it works nicely.\nDo you have any market numbers you can share for any of your markets?\nWe have a very strong position in Norway, for instance with a thriving mobile dating activity. I just looked at the stats this morning again. In Norway we have a base of 300,000 registered users. That’s out of a population of 4.2 million. Not all are active, of course. We have over 1 million users total worldwide including the USA. \nWhat makes Scandinavia such a hotbed for you?\nNorway and Sweden are dream markets because the mobile industry is open. Mobile operators are “copeting.” They’re not restricting competition or putting up mobile “walled gardens.” They are not creating artificial walls but allowing each other’s customers to subscribe to content where they want to; as a result they’ve created quite an amazing mobile content market. It’s equal to 900 million krones just for Norway, so let me do the division, you want it in dollars? You’re talking $150 million dollars (i.e. $35 mobile content spend per year per subscriber). We were the first to offer mobile dating here and we are the leader but we’re not alone anymore, we have a few competitors, but that’s good because, in fact, it helps develop the market. We have got a better position then the competitors because we convince the main operators here that we are a thriving community, so we move up on their mobile Internet (WAP) pages.\nWhat will you and Plutolife do in the next year to rock the world of mobile dating in Europe and USA?\nOne thing, we plan on doing is integration. Handsets are getting more and more advanced, so they can be a natural extension of online communities, whether it’s dating or chatting or blogging, we’ll be there. We’ll do it over multiple handset technologies (e.g. SMS, mobile Internet and Java) because we need to be able to address the whole mobile market. You can’t confine yourself to only having a java solution, if only 10-15% of mobile owners will use a java download. We guide them little by little through the different technologies and let them pick the best one for them.\nWhat technology are you most excited about for the future?\nI dream of the day when there is so much technology embedded in the mobile phone that you can use it almost as if you were on your laptop. I think we’re going to go that way. I think people who are major online players, whether they are dating players or community players, like MSN or Yahoo or MySpace are going to push for that and that’s going to have a very healthy effect on the whole industry. This reminds me of the days when we went from narrow band to broadband on the Internet and suddenly there was a second burst of the Internet because all kinds of new usage exploded. Sharing video is now hot on the Internet and nobody dreamed about that 4 or 5 years ago. It’s possible because of the broadband explosion. The same with mobile, high speeds and third generation and fourth generation speeds and more powerful handsets will enable more and more video sharing. Right now it’s a little bit like wishful thinking, but it will happen.\nThis interview also appears on Mobile Dating Watch\nMay 06, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

Have an affair.’ – including for U.S. government officials, UK civil servants and high-level executives at European and North America corporations.\nThe U.S Defence Department and Postal Service are also investigating the alleged use of military and other government email accounts on the site.\nFormer reality TV star and family values campaigner Josh Duggar admitting to cheating on his wife after reports he had subscribed to the site.\nThe hackers object to the site’s business practices, specifically a “paid delete” option that allows people to pay to remove all their information but, they say, does not actually do that.\nDavid Kennedy, founder and security consultant at TrustedSec, said that the fresh release appears to be authentic. “Everything appears to be legit,” he said in an email. “We have portions downloaded and its confirmed legitimate thus far.”\nA report in Vice Media’s online technology site Motherboard, which first reported the new data dump, said the release bore the same fingerprints as Tuesday’s release.\nThe additional release will likely ratchet up the pressure on Avid Life, which has been quiet about exactly how much and what sort of data was stolen in a breach in July.\nThe company, which also owns websites CougarLife.com and EstablishedMen.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “These guys are very diligent about not being caught,” said Erik Cabetas, managing partner of Include Security, who has done forensic work on the initial dump.\nThe release includes source code for the website as well as smartphone apps and proprietary company data, he added. The availability of the source code could allow other hackers to set up a similar site or find and exploit vulnerabilities on the actual site, which is still operating.\nThe 20-gigabyte data dump reported on Thursday would be roughly double the size of the earlier one.\nDespite the negative publicity surrounding the cyber attack, demand for Ashley Madison’s services has been steady since the data breach first announced in July, said Mark Brooks, CEO of Internet dating consultancy Courtland Brooks.\n“I would have thought this would be a death knell for that company because their entire business basis is privacy,” Brooks said. “It just goes to say that all press is good press…The awareness of the brand is through the roof.”\nU.S. MILITARY, POSTAL SERVICE PROBES\nThe data release could have severe consequences for U.S. service members. Several tech websites reported that more than 15,000 email addresses were government and military ones.\nThe Pentagon said it was aware of reports that military email addresses were among those posted earlier in the week. Defence Secretary Ash Carter told a Pentagon news conference that different service branches were looking into the matter.\n“I’m aware of it. Of course it’s an issue because conduct is very important. We expect good conduct on the part of our people,” Carter said. “The services are looking into it, as well they should be, absolutely.”\nThe U.S. Postal Service and its internal watchdog also plan to review whether or not some of the agency’s employees may have violated federal policies by using their government email on the infidelity website.\nReuters\n", "deleted" : false }

And although there are many startups obtaining angel and venture funding, it can still be difficult to get a job at a promising startup, especially a technology startup. This article provides a dozen concrete tips for finding promising startups and landing a great job.\n1. Establish a Quality LinkedIn Profile\nOne of the first things you should do is to establish a high-quality profile on LinkedIn. Here are some things to do in connection with that profile:\nMake sure that you have detailed all of your experiences and proficiencies. Companies will search for prospective employees on LinkedIn by keyword, so make sure all the relevant keywords that apply to you are listed (e.g., \"social media,\" \"SEO,\" \"Java,\" \"SaaS,\" \"hardware startup,\" \"mobile apps,\" \"html5,\" \"iOS,\" \"healthcare IT,\" or whatever you are proficient in).\nStart to build up your connections. You want to display at least 50-100 connections.\nAsk colleagues to endorse you or provide recommendations on your profile.\nPost articles or blog posts you may have written.\nAdd a professional-looking picture.\nList your skills in order of importance.\nJoin relevant professional groups, which will then be listed in your profile.\nLinkedIn itself provides tips on creating the perfect LinkedIn profile. And check out The 31 Best LinkedIn Profile Tips for Job Seekers.\n2. Get on Email Lists That Provide Startup News\nYou want to keep up-to-date on promising startups, especially ones that have just announced they have gotten a round of venture capital or angel financing. That will typically signal that the company is about to go on a hiring spree. Here are some important email newsletters you can subscribe to for free:\nVentureBeat\n3. Understand the Startup Culture and Issues\nIt's helpful if you have a good understanding of issues that startups face, and in particular the cultural issues of the startup you are interested in. So get a good understanding of all the issues startups encounter, from obtaining financing to hiring and firing, sales and marketing, and much more. Become a regular reader on the key startup sites, such as:\nYahoo Small Business Advisor\n4. Attend Networking and Startup Events\nYou should attend networking and startup tech seminars. This has several benefits: you can meet important connections, learn about interesting startups, and even hear about jobs. Some of my favorites include:\nTo find some local events, do a search in Google for \"startup events\" and the city you are in.\n5. Check Out Angel List\nAngelList is an online resource that allows you to apply for startup jobs. The site also allows you to identify new startups that are looking to raise angel or seed financing. By continually checking the site, you can get an advanced heads up of interesting early stage companies, before they become well known.\n6. Connect With Startup Recruiters\nThere are plenty of job recruiters or \"headhunters\" who will specifically target job opportunities in startups and growing companies. These recruiters will have connections and knowledge as to which companies are hiring. Ask colleagues or friends for connections to these recruiters, or do a search on LinkedIn.\n7. Identify Someone Who Has Connections to the Startup You Are Interested In\nOne of the best ways to get your foot in the door of a startup is to get an introduction to a key decision maker. So you have to figure out what connections you have that may help facilitate that introduction. Here are some things you can check:\nCheck out the LinkedIn profile of the key executives and Board members to see if you have any connections to them.\nReview who has invested in the company (this can often be found by reviewing the company's press releases). If it's a venture fund, go to the fund's Web site and review the bios of the professionals working there.\nDo a search for employees of the company on LinkedIn.\n8. Check Out the Specialized Job Boards\nThere are a number of job boards you can review that specialize in startup jobs. Some of them include:\nhttp://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs\n9. Email the CEO, Founder, or Key Executive\nOnce you have found a company you like, email the CEO, founder, or key executive. Here are the things you should include in the email:\nIdeally, identify a connection to the person you are contacting—can you say that you are emailing him or her at the suggestion of a trusted colleague?\nBriefly state why you think the company is terrific and why you would like to work there.\nKeep the email short and to the point. Early stage executives are very busy.\nAdd your resume or link to your LinkedIn profile.\nExplain that you are a hard worker and willing and able to perform multiple functions (startups have to rely on a small number of people to do many different tasks).\nProvide contact info: a professional-looking email address and your phone number.\n10. Follow Up\nThere is a good chance your email to the company won't get a response. But persevere and send another email (but be careful you don't overdo it and become bothersome). Startup executives are busy and are often buried in email.\n11. Make Sure You Have Prepared for the Interview\nIf you are fortunate enough to land an interview at an interesting startup, do the following to prepare for the interview:\nDo a Google search on the startup and read as many articles about them as you can.\nThoroughly review the startup's Web site.\nRead the company's blogs and postings on social media, especially LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.\nCheck out the LinkedIn profiles of the key executives, and anyone at the company who you may be interviewing with.\nTest out the product or service of the company, and be prepared to talk about your experience and ways you could improve the user experience.\nResearch and understand the startup's industry and chief competitors.\nCheck out the company on Crunchbase.com.\nPractice and be prepared for interview questions you will likely be asked.\n12. Send a Thank You Note After the Interview\nIt's a good idea to send a thank you email to the people who interviewed you. It shows you are respectful, interested, and polite—and it will make you stand out among other applicants who don't do that. Just say that you enjoyed the meeting and appreciated the opportunity to spend some time with the person and learn more about the company. If appropriate, you might also ask them if they would mind connecting on LinkedIn.\nCopyright Richard D. Harroch.

I can understand not doing this for fear of potential lawsuits (not likely), but there aren’t many cases I’ve worked on that haven’t shown a profit.\nUsing those keywords has worked for me in many cases. As long as the option is available, many businesses should be taking advantage of buying trademarked competitor terms if it works financially.\nGiven Google seems to set the rules, if it’s allowed then it should be explored if profitable. If that changes then the option is gone.\nI asked a few notable members of the search community if they used competitor branded keywords and all said they used them successfully.\nLoren Baker, of Search Engine Journal and Traffic Blend , said, “From my experiences, the conversions can be sick, especially with comparison shoppers.” Ultimately, he believes given it “converts like madness” and is allowed you would not be looking after your clients for not adding it to your marketing approach.\nBlast Radius’s Jill Sampey gave a detailed answer that also incorporates the reason Google allows such advertising.\n“People use search engines to find relevant information based primarily on need or interest. If someone searches for ‘Benjamin Moore Paint,’ is information on a sale of Behr paint irrelevant? I don’t think so. At the core of the search is the need for paint, or information on paint. Providing the searcher with information on other options, new brands, etc., is very relevant to their primary need. Providing additional information or options is not preventing a user from going to the Benjamin Moore site. This type of competitive interaction is normal in the offline world. If I go into a store looking for a certain brand, should that store owner just allow me to see the brand I was thinking of, instead of letting me see the whole shelf of products? Why would an advertiser act differently when presented with a similar situation online?”\nGreat points Jill, I’m of a same mind on this one.\nAvi Wilensky, PromediaCorp CEO , who uses competitors’ names as keywords for some of his PPC clients, came from another angle and understood the possible financial problems that could make this seem unprofitable.\n“By bidding on a competitors brand name, you often enter the scenario where the CTR will be so low, it results in the minimum CPC jumping through the roof. I’ve seen cases where Google has forced the min CPC upwards of $50 for a single term, even in cases where no competition exists. This makes sense, since these users are often navigational searchers — looking to directly navigate to a single site. For example, a user who queries “walmart” is probably looking to navigate to walmart.com. They are often not interested in browsing the results. This results in the PPC ad being almost entirely ignored. It’s this phenomena which explains why some of the largest brands on the Web often have no PPC ads running alongside them — advertisers simply are unwilling to pay the high premiums set by Google.”\nVery true Avi, and I’ve found it’s worth working through the high numbers to get to long term profitable keywords.\nAs Lauren Vacarello, of lvlogic , noted “if someone is searching for your competitor, you should be there,” since many times they are looking for something in your shared industry and have associated the competitor with it, but are not specifically looking for the company.\nI’m doing some PPC work for Hotels Cheap and have found that marketing using specific hotels as keywords doesn’t seem to convert profitably even for landing pages where you can book them at the same and sometimes at a lower price. So there are some areas where it doesn’t work, or I can’t find the ad that grabs those searchers.\nNot trying would be a disservice to your client. Companies doing their own marketing should consider this.\nThere’s one situation where a larger company can use this to advantage. Offer the smaller competitors a truce you don’t use their name they don’t use yours. If you are more searched for, it’s a winning move.\nChris Boggs Fires Back\nFrank, good choice mixing your deep knowledge with that of esteemed members of IM-NY.org — especially published the day after a gathering. I like your advice and agree with the idea that in some cases it’s wise to bid on competitor names. I lean towards the tactic being more effective for a product search than a service search, however. If someone is searching for a branded product they may be more susceptible to comparison shopping than if they are looking for a company that provides a service.\nAnother problem that was highlighted by Avi is that the quality score takes a big hit when you’re bidding on a competitor’s name. Of course, you could plaster the content with mentions of that brand, but any vigilant foe would be keeping an eye out for that and likely get quick results in having the offending content and associated ads removed. If you’re sold on search and have deep pockets, perhaps those few clicks that turn into conversions are worth it, especially for high-ticket items.\nI remember when I was at Avenue A, a certain company whose name starts with a lower-case “i” would bid on the parent company term. I approached someone senior in the organization that I happen to work with in promoting the search industry, and asked him why they were doing it. He came back to me with an answer that didn’t surprise me: “You guys were bidding on us.” I pointed out that no such listings existed in searches for their brands, and he arranged to have the ad removed. I highly recommend this approach versus threatening letters if a company is faced with infringers.\nRelated reading\n", "deleted" : false }

(In Canada, just the iPhone version will launch.) As demonstrated in the video above, the app works by pointing your phone's camera at the company's red holiday season coffee cups and 47 additional objects, such as bags of coffee, on display at Starbucks retail locations.\nDoing so will produce animations involving five characters — an ice skater, a squirrel, a boy and a dog sledding and a fox — on your screen. You can also interact with the characters. For instance, if you tap the boy on the sled he does a somersault. Those who activate all five characters can qualify to win an as-yet-unnamed prize.\nThe app also includes traditional and social sharing capabilities. You can the send ecards as well as holiday offers from Starbucks, among other things.\nThe object, says Alexandra Wheeler, vp-global digital marketing for Starbucks, is to \"surprise and delight\" customers during the holiday season.\nAlthough Starbucks experimented with an AR app years ago in an ad, Wheeler says this is the first major AR push by the company. The effort follows some other recent AR programs from marketers including an app from Nivea featuring Rihanna and an Amazon app that lets you point your phone at objects and then buy them.\nCup Magic, created by Blast Radius , caps off a year of successful mobile implementations by Starbucks. The brand launched a mobile payment app in January that has been used in more than 20 million transactions and a QR code program designed, like Starbucks Cup Magic, to enhance the in-store brand experience.\n", "deleted" : false }

Augmented reality — a group of technologies that marry the virtual with the real world — is finally graduating from being an idle scientific curiosity to more of an everyday experience. (Related GigaOM Pro report: “ Augmented Reality: Lots of Promise, Lots of Hurdles” — subscription required.) For me, the usefulness of augmented reality is illustrated by a set of applications from Soundwalk , an audio tour company that is based in New York and Paris. The company recently released iPhone applications that combine the audio tours with real-world locations in cities such as Paris ( iTunes Store link ).\nAfter installing the app, you can get an hour-long tour, recorded in the voice of a French celebrity. There are cues to find starting points and get practical info about places to visit as well as interactive maps that use geo-localization. These applications, which till recently have worked on the iPhone, also are available on Android.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to these walking tours, Soundwalk released a free app called 24 Hours: The Starck Mix, a custom 24-hour soundtrack, selected, arranged, composed and mixed by French designer Philippe Starck . It is seriously cool and mind-bending. Grab it from the iTunes store . Whenever the listener presses play, the mix will start from the exact time it is in his current time zone, no matter where in the world he is that day.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Sorry.” (Here, he inserted a smiley face for good measure.)\nIf Juno gets a high valuation despite more turbulent times for startups right now, it won’t surprise. Marco sold his last company, the messaging app Viber, for $900 million to the Japanese internet giant Rakuten. Marco also cofounded and long ran iMesh, one of the earliest P2P networks.\nMarco seemingly has plenty of drivers willing to join his new platform. According to one source, the company — which targets Uber and Lyft drivers who have a rating of at least 4.7 out of 5 stars on either platform — Juno already has a waitlist of drivers that’s six months long.\nThat’s likely owing to numerous deal sweeteners that Juno is offering them, including, most significantly, equity in the company. Indeed, the company has said it’s saving half its founding shares for drivers, equity that will be diluted alongside those of Juno’s four founders as investors back the company. (The other three founders, Igor Magazinnik, Sani Maroli and Ofer Smocha, cofounded Viber with Marco.)\nJuno also says it will take a 10 percent cut from each ride, compared with Uber, which takes 20 percent on average. It will have 24-hour support for its drivers. And drivers will be allowed to block riders with whom they’ve had a bad experience.\nIn a recent interview, Marco acknowledged that  “Juno will have multiple features not found in Uber,” but he said that ” to me this is not the key thing. To me what matters the most is the fact that at the heart of Juno is a belief that it’s time for a ride-sharing service that treated drivers right. It’s time for an ethical, socially responsible ride-sharing service. And that’s what we are doing.\n“It’s the overall attitude towards drivers,” he added. “It’s the respect and transparency in the way the company deals with its drivers, who are also owners.”\nThe company, which has been operating in so-called stealth mode in New York, has not specified an official launch date yet, but Marco said that “we are slowly warming up the engine, no pun intended.”\nUp to now, Marco has been very quiet about how Juno has been financing its operations. When we asked Marco about this a few weeks ago, he said only that the money has come from “us, friends, investors.”\nWe also asked why he thought it still possible to compete against Uber, which not only has a lot of scale at this point across over 400 markets, but also many billions of dollars in funding.\n“When you have something good, something right, you can rely on viral distribution, on word of mouth,” said Marco. “Other companies pay tens of millions, even hundreds of millions [of dollars], in referral fees to drivers so they’ll bring their friends. So far our referral fees paid [are] a very round number: Zero dollars.”\nMore, he continued, “What are [Uber’s] drivers going to get when these services go public? Zero. What are drivers going to get when self-driving cars come? They get ‘deactivated.'” As a Juno shareholder, Marco said, “The driver gets to own a piece of each and every car out there.”\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

It’s been a busy week of funding announcements for 2.0 style sites. Jellyfish searches for products across more than 1000 thousand stores that provide Cost-Per-Action compensation to Jellyfish for each purchase. Jellyfish then returns “at least half” of that compensation to users. Thus search results display the base price for any given store selling an item, the CPA return percentage and thus the ultimate price for buyers. Jellyfish calls it a Value Per Action (VPA) model.\nKegonsa Capital Partners and the company’s founders Brian Wiegand and Mark McGuire provided initial seed funding for the company earlier this year. There is no shortage of comparison shopping sites around the web, but very few of them are this interesting. Sharing affiliate revenue is nothing new (see our coverage of Kulist and FatWallet , for example) but doing it with class and getting funding is impressive.\nIf the site gains substantial adoption, the company hopes it can drive base prices down and commissions up. Vivek Puri’s excellent blog StartupSquad had a good explanation of the service and reported that the round was about to close two weeks ago.

Jellyfish had also raised about $5 million a year ago, with much of the funding going towards the improvement of Jellyfish's search technology and social components for shopping online.\nIt's expected that Jellyfish will be incorporated into Windows Live search, but its extensive social networking components and live games, including Smack Shopping, are the crowning jewels of its social shopping experience. With Microsoft's revised focus on growing its online presence in the social networking realm, this may be more heavily incorporated into some of Windows Live's other services, such as its niche community or moms .\nMicrosoft has also announced that it will be tweaking its ad platform for Windows Live Search, which will shift more attention to the quality of prominent ad placement.

His observation was that 2013 reminded him a lot about 1998 in the tech sector.\nIn 1998 I was an entrepreneur so consumed with my second startup that I rarely came up for air to pay attention to the macro events occurring around me. An investment banker, however, would have been able to see the forest from the trees.\nHere’s why 2013 eerily exhibits many of the same traits that characterized the tech sector in 1998:\n1998 bore witness to a wave of consecutively record-breaking venture financings. The tech news headline-grabbers of the day included: Ask.com, Cooking.com, E Ink, GeoCities, The Knot, and Priceline.\nWithin the past 12 months, albeit at an order of magnitude higher, Answers, Box, Deem, Dropbox, Jawbone, LendingClub, Spotify, Turn, to name a few all raised VC rounds in the range of 100’s of millions of dollars.\nWhen a tech startup raises a big financing round, pressure mounts to deploy that capital on high-return projects, not just let the money sit in the bank. Some firms in 1998 squandered their funds on items like company cars and Aeron chairs , however even the most diligently-managed startups ran out of compelling ideas for organic development and started to look externally. Raising a large equity round mathematically translates into a large equity valuation. The need to justify such valuations can act as a catalyst for m&a.\nAlbeit not directly related, but as my investment banker friend reminded me, in 1998 the world witnessed an economic crisis in emerging markets. The Asian financial crisis took hold in Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, and the Philippines. Shortly theafter, the Ruble crisis gripped Russia, and then in the third quarter of 1998 Argentina entered its economic depression. Similarly, in 2013 we’ve seen slowing growth and/or inflationary concerns fairly uniformly across the world’s BRIC countries. Conversely, developed countries fared well. The world’s economic engine, the U.S. economy, expanded at a decent clip of 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Aging Japan is demonstrating renewed vibrancy, and even in stale Europe, Germany, the Nordics, the UK, and even Spain are offering some glimmers of potential.\nCue Prince and the little red corvette\nHere’s where it gets exciting. If 2013 in tech is like 1998, then maybe 2014 will turn out like… 1999, woohoo !\nWell, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. However, there are some encouraging signs for those tech entrepreneurs and VCs who benefit from premium strategic acquisitions. In late 1998 and into 1999, a number of large public companies started facing questions from activist shareholders about their ‘Dot-com Strategy’. Nowadays, the interrogations center more on the strategies around mobile and big data.\nFurthermore, the proportion of earnings misses rose. Feeling pressure from shifting market dynamics, demands for visionary leadership, and missed financial forecasts, managers of public companies can be tempted to view acquisitions as a convenient tool mask their shortfalls. The frenzy of tech m&a in 1999 was second only to an irrationally exuberant IPO market.\nThis time around, stock market investors appear to be more discerning, for the moment. But the pattern of surprises in earnings or business KPIs is unmistakable over recent weeks: LinkedIn , Amazon , Samsung , Apple , even freshly-public Twitter .\nGeeks like me that were into futuristic tech thriller movies in 1998 probably watched Enemy of the State in the theaters. Will Smith played a genuinely likable lawyer whose life turns upside-down when he accidentally comes into possession of a video tape showing the murder of a congressman by NSA agents, assassinated to ease the passage of an overreaching surveillance bill.\nPerhaps history doesn’t repeat itself, but it may rhyme.\n", "deleted" : false }

Betaout through a single tool is helping its customers achieve the same and we are enthused to be part of their journey.\nWhat would be important to see is how Betaout will compete and survive among it’s competitors like, AgilOne and SugarCRM?\nBetaout’s goal is to establish itself as a market leader by creating what Maheshwari describes as an “operating system for marketers.”, which will include a hoard of marketing tools embedded in it to help the marketers analyze everything in one application.\n", "deleted" : false }

Danny Socolof and Jeff Henshaw think they can bring concerts onto the Web with their startup DeepRockDrive. Socolof is a veteran music marketer and Henshaw hails from Microsoft, where he was on the Xbox team. With DeepRockDrive, they want to film concerts in their high-tech Las Vegas soundstage, broadcast them live over the Web, and sell tickets for $6.99 each, splitting the proceeds with the musicians.\nThe startup—which has raised $3 million in angel funding from Socolof, Henshaw, David Goldberg (founder of Launch Media and the first GM of Yahoo Music), Bill Curbishley (manager of The Who and Robert Plant), and the Becker Family (Brian Becker is the former CEO of Live Nation)—has already quietly recorded and broadcast 45 shows since last September. That was its beta period. Now, on Tuesday, it will be launching itself in a more public fashion with a concert coinciding with the Consumer Electronics Show (which is taking place in Las Vegas next week). It plans on filming more than 100 shows in 2008, plus free promotional shows every Friday.\nHere is how it works. The band plays in the soundstage (with or without a live audience). The shows are filmed with five Sony HD cameras, and each Web viewer can pick which camera angle he or she wants to watch. The audience can also vote on the order of the songs on the set list or make their own song requests. They can also send in messages during the show that the band sees on large screens surrounding the stage. Prior to shows (DeepRockDrive calls them socialcasts), bands try to drum up support with digital posters on their Websites and MySpace pages that fans can take and put on their own Web pages. On DeepRockDrive, fans can petition for concerts from their favorite bands, like this one for Flight of the Conchords . If the shows get enough votes, it makes it easier for the bands to decide to fly to Las Vegas to record the show.\nWhile the experience of watching a live show on your computer screen will never match actually being at a live concert, DeepRockDrive is offering a distributed fan base an opportunity to watch a show from bands that might never otherwise come to their towns. For instance, Australian rocker Shannon Noll is going to do a DeepRockDrive concert aimed at expat Australian fans in the U.S. Declares Socolof:\nThe future of the music business will be hundreds of thousands of artists that have fan bases of between 5,000 to 100,000, not 50 artists that have one million or more.\nSocolof is also talking to music labels (both indies and the majors) about possible joint ventures. Traditionally, labels did not have much to do with the concert side of the business, but that is changing. Predicts Socolof:\nIn the old world, yes, concerts were separate from the labels. In the new world, there will be a different approach in the partnership between labels and their artists. Labels will need to contribute more to the success of their artists.\nMaybe. I don’t think the artists want to start splitting concert fees with the labels. Socolof is also not opposed to rewarding fans who turn out to be the biggest promoters of shows, although there is no mechanism yet for them to be rewarded. (Free tickets for anyone who generates a certain amount of sales wouldn’t be a bad start. Flying the biggest fans/promoters in for the show would be even better).\nDeepRockDive is starting small. Its socialcasts can support only a few thousand simultaneous viewers right now. That will grow to tens of thousands in a few months. “Our goal is a million front row seats,” says Socolof. Hey, the guy is a music promoter.\nHere is an archived video of a band called Socratic. It starts off slow, but you get a sense of what the performance space looks like with large screens filled with live messages from the Web audience:\n", "deleted" : false }

But the site was tough for recruiters to actively use because they had to comb through profiles of potential applicants. Today, Jobfox is unveiling a new version of the site that hopes to solve this problem. Essentially Jobfox allows corporate recruiters and headhunters to create private hiring networks. Job seekers can create a profile on the site and join corporate networks for companies they are interested in working for.\nJobfox says that the virtue of using its network vs LinkedIn for job seeking is that it is completely focused on job seekers and recruiters as opposed to socializing or sharing content. Because to connections made between job seekers and recruiters are confidential and not published on the network, it also ensures user privacy.\nAnd the site will actually connect with LinkedIn and Facebook to alert you of your friends that work at the companies you want to work at, and it pulls in data from Twitter and company HR sites to alert seekers of job openings not displayed anywhere else.\nMembers can also “boost” friends or colleagues for jobs and earn financial incentives if the connection results in a hire. It’s important to note that Jobfox focuses exclusively on salaried jobs as opposed to hourly positions or freelance opportunities. Currently, 7,000 companies are represented on the site and roughly 140,000 jobs are advertised per month on the site.\nWhile LinkedIn has also become a popular destination for job seekers, there is certainly room for a number of players in the social recruiting space. What LinkedIn has in it’s favor, however, is a massive userbase (which is nearing 100 million). But considering McGovern’s prior experience in the online job market, Jobfox is definitely worth a look.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

What has stood out to me in particular is how free services subsidized by ads do not seem to work well in markets like China and India. Jenny Lee, from GGV Capital, mentioned this point in a recent interview .\nAn original early theory of this observation was related to the economy of a particular region. Those economies that were wealthier, or even healthier, tended to be ones that supported a business model of free services subsidized by ads. The theory was that consumers in those economies spend more, and as a result, were more attractive to present with advertising. However, even as China has grown significantly in purchasing power, we still don’t see free-with-advertising business models succeeding there. Rather, transaction-based business models are working well in China.\nSimilarly in India, the free-with-ads business model is struggling. While Facebook is not in China, perhaps this slide from Facebook’s Q2 2015 earnings visualizes the point I’m making:\nFacebook’s services may very well touch more humans every day than Google’s. It makes Facebook a decent bellwether to analyze this business model at a global level. If Facebook’s global average revenue per user numbers look like this, you can imagine that Google’s, Twitter’s and many other free services subsidized by ads have similar regional ARPUs. Just to put a stamp on this point, note Facebook’s ARPU in Asia-Pacific; and while Facebook is not directly in China, WeChat’s ARPU is estimated to be around $7. WeChat has succeeded at encouraging ARPU to around the same as Facebook in the U.S. & Canada, with a very different business model, and in a market where free-with-ad business models are challenged.\nThe state of each economy may play into this dynamic. This is a chart I like on the subject, highlighting where many economies are, relative to each other:\nThis chart is from 2011, but I looked at the most recent (2014) data from the World Bank and the IMF, and not a great deal has changed. Based on the point I’ve made, you could argue that free-with-advertising based models work better in countries to the far right of the graph versus those well below the line — at least for the time being. Which, if true, makes for the follow-up observation that most of those countries have a mature and saturated consumer Internet. All the growth in users and new business opportunities is going to come from countries with less developed economies, purchasing power and many other fundamentals that impact this particular business model. This is a key element to why we see transaction-based business models finding more success in the East.\nIf it plays out this way, then to grow, many companies with free-with-advertising business models will need to evolve to include more transactions, as well. Perhaps this is why Twitter, Pinterest and even Facebook are trying to encourage more purchasing by adding “buy” or other action buttons to encourage a transaction of some kind, in order to collect a share of the transaction. The mantra for many companies facing slowing revenue growth is to maximize ARPU of existing customers. This is where much of the evolution of these free-with-advertising services is likely to evolve.\nWhile these are current and distinct observations, the story is not over. Something important has not happened yet that may alter the thesis on these business models. Mobile commerce is not the dominant Internet transaction model yet. When this happens — and it will — not only will we see country by country e-commerce statistics rise, we may see extremely active shoppers ready and willing to be incentivized to purchase.\nI’m that convinced mobile commerce will be the catalyst to drive overall e-commerce to new heights. With this will come the opportunity to be even more targeted with purchase interests. Whether this manifests itself by way of traditional or new types of advertising, we do not yet know. However, while there is a clear separation of Eastern- and Western-market business models today, we may see some convergence going forward, as each market learns from the other.\nBen Bajarin is a principal analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. , an industry analysis, market intelligence and research firm located in Silicon Valley.

As a result, our reported income and profit numbers are impacted on a comparative basis. However, excluding the profit from sale and operational impacts of CSL, our business continued to perform strongly.\"\nTelstra's mobile revenue increased by 10.2 percent year over year, from AU$9.7 billion last year to AU$10.7 billion in FY14-15, adding 664,000 mobile retail customer services to bring the total number to 16.7 million.\nThe telco added 113,000 post-paid handheld retail customers in the year, bringing its total to 7.3 million customers, with revenue in this sector increasing by 7.7 percent to AU$5.4 billion. Average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 5.5 percent, from AU$58.70 to AU$61.94.\nPrepaid handheld revenue increased by 13.1 percent, to AU$994 million, while its machine-to-machine business grew by 11.9 percent, to AU$113 million.\nTelstra noted that its national 4G network now provides coverage to 94 percent of the population, with the telco continuing its 4G network expansion in order to service 99 percent of Australians. As of the end of the financial year, Telstra has 7.7 million 4G devices on its network.\nThe telco noted that growth will increase next financial year thanks to the launch of its AU$100 million \" Telstra Air \" national Wi-Fi network in June. Last month, during his inaugural keynote address as new CEO of Telstra, Andrew Penn also committed to increasing the company's mobile network capex by investing AU$500 million into it over the next two years.\nIn regards to its fixed-line business though, total revenue fell by 1.9 percent, from AU$7.08 billion to AU$6.94 billion. Telstra's customers continued the trend over this financial year of shifting from voice to data usage, with fixed-line voice revenue decreasing by 7.1 percent to AU$3.7 billion, ARPU decreasing by 4.3 percent to AU$42.05, and 264,000 retail customers disconnecting their fixed-line voice services, bringing the total number down to 6 million. At the same time, fixed data revenue grew by 7.3 percent, to AU$2.4 billion, and 189,000 retail fixed broadband customers were added, bringing the total to 3.1 million subscribers.\nAs of June 30, Telstra has made 211,000 National Broadband Network (NBN) connections, categorised by 41,000 voice-only services and 9,000 data-only bundles.\nData and IP revenue decreased by 2.9 percent, from AU$2.99 billion to AU$2.88 billion, while its network applications and services (NAS) business saw a significant increase of 23.2 percent, from AU$1.96 billion up to AU$2.42 billion. The latter's growth was attributed to existing and new contracts, as well as acquisitions. International NAS grew by 41.4 percent, to AU$99 million, with the $697 million Pacnet acquisition contributing AU$14 million. Its acquisition of Bridge Point contributed to its 21.8 percent growth in managed network services revenue.\nIn regards to IPTV -- a category including the revenues from Foxtel, T-Box, BigPond Movies, and Presto -- its media services business saw a 3.4 percent increase in revenue, to AU$931 million, despite the launch of Netflix Australia . Foxtel alone increased by 9.4 percent, to AU$662 million in revenue for FY14-15 due to an increased number of subscribers after the bundle price reductions. Its T-Box sales declined by AU$33 million, however.\nFor the financial year ahead, the telco said it forecasts delivering mid single-digit growth for its income, and low single-digit EBITDA increases.\n\"Free cash flow is expected to be between AU$4.6 billion and AU$5.1 billion, and capital expenditure to be around 15 percent of sales to fund increased mobile network investment,\" the telco said on Thursday.\nTelstra also hopes to net new customers with its announcement to offer 12-month subscriptions to Apple Music after shuttering its MOG music-streaming service in July.\n\"Finally, we will give Australian music fans a great music experience as the only telco in Australia to offer Apple Music,\" Penn said during the results call.\nLast month, the Australian government released its draft Migration Assurance Policy detailing the process for customers to be migrated from Telstra's legacy copper network to the fixed-line NBN, calling for migration data and information to be shared between Telstra Wholesale, NBN, retail service providers (RSPs), and application service providers.\nCommunications Minister Malcolm Turnbull had confirmed in January that plans for a revised migration plan to be lodged with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) had been finalised, with the plan to govern how customers will be migrated and how Telstra will disconnect its copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks thereafter. In June, the ACCC approved the plan , seven months after Telstra and NBN had entered a revised AU$11 billion deal allowing NBN to take ownership of Telstra's copper and HFC network assets.\nAt the end of July, however, Telstra spoke out against a draft decision by the ACCC to cut the prices that Telstra can charge its wholesale customers for use of its legacy copper network by 9.6 percent, saying the price slash could impact the NBN customer migration, as retailers would \"have a profit motive to keep their customers on the higher-margin copper network for as long as possible\".\n\"This would make migration to the NBN even harder to achieve, and put important revenue to NBN Co at risk. In this way, a cut to prices on the legacy network poses a serious danger to the success of the NBN policy,\" Telstra warned in a blog post .\nWhile the ACCC had originally planned to reduce prices across seven of its fixed-line wholesale services by 0.7 percent, its revised price cut was attributed to the decision not to force customers stuck on Telstra's legacy copper network to pay higher prices while waiting for an NBN connection.\nTelstra equated the mandated 9.6 percent cut in wholesale prices to a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the next few years, with the telco saying the reduced costs to be paid by retailers for use of its network would fall below the company's actual costs.\n\"There are ... a number of upcoming ACCC decisions that will potentially impact the wholesale prices in our FY16 reported results,\" Telstra CFO Warwick Bray said when announcing the results on Thursday morning.\n\"The ACCC is consulting on new access determinations, including a draft determination on fixed-line services. The draft fixed-lined services determination is of concern; we don't agree with the draft decision. We continue to make our position on this clear within the regulatory process. [If] the draft decision were implemented from October, the EBITDA reduction in FY16 would be up to AU$19 million.\"\nIn its own submission (PDF) on the matter, the Department of Communications mirrored Telstra's perspective, saying that the ACCC's decision should be amended to allow Telstra to recover its costs, and to prevent cost discrepancies from dissuading customers from migrating to the NBN.\nIn response, the Competitive Carriers Coalition (CCC) along with TPG and Optus , slammed the government for involving itself in an independent pricing review, particularly when recommending that customers be charged more.\n\"The Department of Communications' intervention in the ACCC's independent price-determination process to advance the interests of Telstra is extraordinary, unwelcome, unwarranted, and sets a dangerous precedent,\" the CCC -- made up of Vodafone, Macquarie Telecom, iiNet, Nextgen Networks, and MyNetFone -- said.\n\"For a government department to be calling for higher prices for ordinary consumers, and against the interests of competition, is surely a first at the federal level... For it to be doing so in the context of fixed-line communications services, where we Australia has (sic) the national disgrace of the highest prices in the developed world, beggars belief.\"\nThe CCC accused the government of wanting \"to see millions of dollars transferred from the pockets of Australian consumers to Telstra, one of the most profitable telecommunications companies in the world\".\nLast week, Telstra announced that it is partnering with Pivotal for an enterprise software platform, and has subsequently become a member of the Cloud Foundry Foundation.\nIt also opened its Gurrowa Innovation Lab, which provides a co-creation space for Telstra and its associated enterprise customers, vendors, research institutes, and incubators to collaborate on projects via the Pivotal and Cloud Foundry Foundation-provided open-source platform-as-a-service cloud software.\nAt the end of last month, rival telco Vodafone Australia announced a net loss of AU$183.6 million for the first half, up 13.3 percent from the AU$158.6 million loss in the same period last year. The company reported total revenue of AU$1.77 billion, a year-on-year increase of 2.9 percent.\nThe Vodafone results (PDF) also revealed a slight increase in its post-paid customer base, which grew 3.3 percent year on year in the half ended June 2015 to 3.1 million. Prepaid customers grew marginally, up 0.1 percent to almost 1.7 million, while ARPU increased by 2 percent year on year to AU$51.32.\nTelstra's primary competitor Optus has yet to report its H1 2015 results, but in May, it reported adding 42,000 net new customers in the first three months of the year .\nOptus' customer numbers could soon be eclipsed, however, thanks to iiNet shareholders last month approving TPG's AU$1.5 billion takeover bid . The acquisition will result in TPG becoming Australia's second-largest telco after Telstra, increasing its customer base to 1.7 million.\nIn February, Telstra reported its half-year results for the second half of 2014, recording a net profit increase of 21.7 percent, to AU$2.1 billion. This was largely attributed to the iPhone 6 launch.\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

He hopes the move will expand participation in Npm's development, as participating today could be awkward because the program is owned and maintained by a single company.\n[ Need a JavaScript tool for your dev shop? InfoWorld looks at 17 JavaScript editors and IDEs ready for adoption. | Keep up with hot topics in programming with InfoWorld's Strategic Developer blog and Application Development newsletter . ]\nPlans call for completing the move by the end of this year, with Npm Inc. still participating. Other companies are already interested in working with the foundation, Schleuter said, though he would not reveal their names.\nThe command-line client works with the Npm registry, which features a collection of packages of open source code for Node.js. The Npm system lets developers write bits of code packaged as modules for purposes ranging from database connectors to JavaScript frameworks to command-line tools and CSS tooling.\nEnterprise connectivity vendor Equinix, for example, will offer its upcoming AquaJS microservices framework via Npm. Schleuter has called the module system a \"killer feature\" of Node.js and a big reason for the server-side JavaScript platform's success. Npm Inc. says there are nearly 242,000 total packages and about 3.5 billion downloads in the past month alone.\nSchleuter said that efforts would be made to keep the project on strong footing, adding \"what we really don't want to do is break something that's working.\" There are transparent development processes already in place, he said, and in addition to encouraging more outside participation in NPM's development, the foundation should ensure the project's continuity.\nNode.js itself was moved to an independent foundation , simply called the Node.js Foundation, last year, after gripes arose with Joyent's handling of the project and a fork of the technology occurred called io.js . But io.js has since been folded back into Node.js. \"I think [developing a governance model] will be a lot easier than it was with Node because the team is more on the same page and there are not as many hurdles to jump through,\" Schlueter said.\nNpm Inc. runs the open source Npm registry as a free service and will continue to do so after the foundation is formed. The company also offers tools and services to support the secure use of packages in a private or enterprise context.\nRELATED TOPICS\n", "deleted" : false }

It may emerge in its constituent parts rather than as a whole,\" Negroponte said.\nOLPC started off in 2005 as a laptop project and is well known as a hardware innovator, with its first XO-1 laptop being praised for its unique and environmentally friendly design. The XO-3 cancellation comes as OLPC officials say the organisation could de-emphasise the focus on hardware design in the long run in favour of education projects.\nThe nonprofit group announced plans for the XO-3 tablet in 2009 and showed early samples at CES earlier this year. The tablet was supposed to ship earlier this year for $100, but it was delayed while OLPC finalised the design and sought partners to manufacture the XO-3. The tablet was meant to be a low-cost computing tool for students in developing countries.\nThe XO-3 was originally priced at $75 and that triggered a backlash, in part because critics said the price was unrealistic. OLPC didn't plan to have the product manufactured itself, as it did with the XO-1 laptop, which too was delayed and eventually shipped at double its promised $100 price tag.\nRelated\nStrategies for successfully adopting Hadoop\nThe XO-3 design is still available, and it is more likely that companies use some of the tablet's key technologies, such as flexible power input and charging efficiency, said Ed McNierney, the chief technology officer at OLPC.\n\"There's a lot of decent tablet technology out there - it's really a question of putting things together in the right package for the children we're trying to serve,\" McNierney said. \"The Nexus 7 is nice, too, and a more kid-friendly size, and there are other good examples.\"\nThe tablet shown at CES had a rugged body, an 8-inch screen and included optional technologies such as a solar charger and support for satellite Internet. It used a display from Pixel Qi that conserves battery life by using ambient light to brighten the screen.\nOLPC's priority has always been education and the need to design its own complete hardware systems \"may go away,\" Negroponte said. Tablets are an important learning tool for children, but companies may be able to ruggedise existing low-cost products for use in schools, he said.\n\"We had to build the XO-1 laptop, but we do not have to build the tablet,\" Negroponte said, adding that, \"the need for OLPC may morph into something else.\"\nOLPC also designed a hybrid laptop-tablet called the XO-4 Touch (top image), which includes some of the XO-3's features. That product is still scheduled to ship early next year. The XO-4 resembles the original XO-1 laptop but has a touchscreen that can swivel around and fold over the keyboard to make an e-reader.\nAs an alternative to the XO-3, Negroponte is not opposed to buying low-cost tablets and distributing them to schools. Tablets from companies such as Motorola, which have been deployed as an educational tool in developing countries, have shown good power management and no breakage in rugged environments.\n\"I am surprised how good they are, as they were not designed for the environment,\" Negroponte said.\nExperiments have shown that tablets have made basic learning and computing easier, he said.\n\"The amazing result is that the kids are showing all the precursors of reading,\" Negroponte said.\nOLPC will continue with hardware design on the XO-4 and beyond for the simple reason that there are now nearly 3 million XO devices around the world, McNierney said.\n\"That means two things: ongoing support for the existing customers, and ongoing engineering to keep the design current. Existing customers need additional units, spare parts, etc. and that need won't go away,\" McNierney said.\nComponents also must be refreshed every 18 to 24 months to keep using readily available parts and to keep the price down.\n\"That doesn't mean, of course, that OLPC needs to be the organisation to do those things in the long run. That's the nice part of being a nonprofit; we do things - like design hardware - when no one else is stepping up to do them. If someone else can do them, we can stop,\" McNierney said.\n", "deleted" : false }

It has nothing left to prove. There's never been a year of the Linux desktop and there probably never will be, but it runs on the majority of the world's servers. It never took over the desktop, it did an end-run around it: there are more Linux-based client devices accessing those servers than there are Windows boxes.\nLinux Foundation boss Jim Zemlin puts it this way: \"It's in literally billions of devices. Linux is the native development platform for every SOC. Freescale, Qualcomm, Intel, MIPS: Linux is the immediate choice. It's the de facto platform. It's the client of the Internet.\"\nLinux is big business, supported by pretty much everyone – even Microsoft . Open source has won, but it did it by finding the niches that fit it best – and the biggest of these is on the millions of servers that power the Web. Linux is what runs the cloud, and the cloud is big business now.\nWhich is why last year's LinuxCon Europe was full of smartly dressed professionals rather than beards and beer-guts, and also why every other talk seemed to be about containers.\nOne of the core technological enablers of the cloud is virtualisation: to achieve the fêted \"web scale\" by dividing tasks across multiple separate servers, and bringing those servers online as and when the load requires by starting and stopping VMs.\nBut VMs are expensive. Not in terms of money – although they can be – but in resources and complexity. Whole-system virtualisation is a special kind of emulator : under one host OS, you start another, guest one. Everything is duplicated – the whole OS, and the copy that does the work is running on virtual – in other words: pretend, emulated – hardware, with the performance overhead that implies. Plus, of course, the guest OS has to boot up like a normal one, so starting VMs takes time.\nWhich is what has led one wag to comment that: \" Hypervisors are the living proof of operating system's incompetence .\"\nFighting words! What do they mean, incompetence? Well, here are a few examples.\nThe kernel of your operating system of choice doesn't scale well onto tens of cores or terabytes of NUMA RAM? No problem: partition the machine, run multiple copies in optimally sized VMs.\nYour operating system isn't very reliable? Or you need multiple versions, or specific app versions on the operating system? No problem. VMs give you full remote management, because the hardware is virtual. You can run lots of copies in a failover cluster – and that applies to the host hardware, too. VMs on a failed host can be auto-migrated to another.\nEven down at the small end of the scale, a SOHO operation with one server, it still helps. Operating system needs specific drivers and config to boot on a particular model of machine? If the box dies, the backup can't just be restored onto a newer replacement – it won't boot. No problem: dedicate the box to run a single VM. This provides a standard hardware template, eliminating driver problems. You can move the installed OS from one machine to another with impunity, unlike a bare-metal install. It facilitates backup and restore, capacity planning and more.\nMake no mistake, virtualisation is a fantastic tool that has enabled a revolution in IT. There are tons of excellent reasons for using it, which in particular fit extremely well in the world of long-lived VMs holding elaborately configured OSs which someone needs to maintain. It enables great features, like migrating a live running VM from one host to another. It facilitates software-defined networking, simplifying network design. If you have stateful servers, full of data and config, VMs are just what you need.\nAnd in that world, proprietary code rules: Windows Server and VMware, and increasingly, Hyper-V.\nBut it's less ideal if you're an internet-centric business, and your main concern is quick, scalable farms of small, mostly-stateless servers holding microservices built out of FOSS tools and technologies. No licences to worry about – it's all free anyway. Spin up new instances as needed and destroy them when they're not.\nEach instance is automatically configured with Puppet or Ansible, and they all run the same Linux distro – whatever your techies prefer, which probably means Ubuntu for most, Debian for the hardcore and CentOS for those committed to the RPM side of the fence.\nIn this world, KVM and Xen are the big players, with stands and talks at events such as LinuxCon devoted to them. Free hypervisors for free operating systems – but the same drawbacks apply: running Linux under Linux means lots of duplication of the stack, lots of unnecessary virtualisation of hardware, inefficient resource-sharing between VMs, slow VM start-up times, and so on.\nAnd the reason that everyone is talking about containers is they solve most of these issues. If your kernel scales well and all your workloads are on the same kernel anyway, then containers offer the isolation and scalability features of VMs without most of the overheads. We talked about how they work in 2011, but back then, Linux containers were still fairly new and crude.\nSince then, though, one product has galvanised the development of Linux containers: Docker. Originally a wrapper adding some handy additional facilities to LXC, Docker has expanded to support multiple back-ends. A whole new section of the software industry is growing around Docker. New types of Linux distro are being built to host Docker containers, such as CoreOS and Red Hat's Project Atomic . CoreOS also has its own rival format to Docker, called Rocket . Docker isn't limited to Linux, either. Existing Docker containers can be run on Joyent's SmartOS , based on a fork of OpenSolaris, and a version of Docker will be available to manage the Windows containers of Windows Server 2016 , too. Even Oracle is making interested noises .\nMeanwhile, Canonical has a different take on the containers model with its own flavour, LXD.\nNone of this means the end of \"traditional\" virtualisation. Containers are great for microservices, but at least in their current incarnations, they're less ideal for existing complex server workloads. The current generation of management tools is also far weaker, and as such, most people are running their containerised workloads on top of a host OS inside a VM – even though there are performance penalties to doing so.\nPlus, as containers pose a clear threat to existing hypervisor vendors, companies are scrambling to find ways to make VMs that behave more like containers .\nNow that operating-system level virtualisation has finally arrived on the default Unix of the Web era, it is poised to radically transform the market – and Linux. And that means, too, lots of new code and lots of new buzzwords. ®\n", "deleted" : false }

What kinds of investments do they like making, and how do they see themselves in the VC landscape?\nWe're highlighting key members of the community to find out.\nAlex Gurevich  is a Partner at  Javelin Venture Partners .\nPrior to joining Javelin, Gurevich was a Principal at DFJ Aurora. Before that he was the first employee and Director of Business Development at ooma, a venture-backed company in the consumer electronics, VoIP (voice over IP) space, where he led his company's initial product roll out, customer acquisition and retail distribution strategy. Gurevich was also co-founder of Say-Hey-Hey.com, one of the web's first free video dating sites, where he was in charge of all product development, fundraising, and business development efforts.\nGurevich holds an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he was co-President of the Venture Capital Club, a leader of a Global Study Trip, and a Board Fellow. He also holds a B.S. in Management Science and Engineering, a B.A. in International Relations, and an M.S. in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford.\nVatorNews: What is your investment philosophy or methodology?\nAlex Gurevich: We invest in companies that are at the Series A stage, that have a unique team that's perfectly suited to go after a problem that they're trying to solve, so they have some unique secret that someone else doesn't have. They're typically going after a very large, total addressable market, and I'm not talking about a few billion dollars but tens of billions of dollars, typically. And we're also, because we're a smaller fund, our current fund is $125 million, we're looking for companies that are capital efficient, and they some form of leverage built into their distribution strategy or their business model, that allows them to get big, and by big I mean lots of revenue, around $75 million to $100 million annual revenue without having to raise a ton of capital. And nowadays you can actually do that, you can build very capital efficient businesses without needing, you know, like tens of millions of dollars to prove out the concept.\nBy leverage I mean in terms of the distribution strategy or the business model. That means that there's some sort of advantage that a company might have in their distribution strategy that allows them to get big without having to spend money on marketing, or build out a big sales team, things of that nature. A good example of this, we have an investment in a company called Thumbtack. So that was a Series A investment for us and with them they figured out business model that allowed revenues to sale pretty quickly without having to spend a ton of money on marketing. They also have a lot of SEO and organic search marketing, which is obviously fairly cheap and doesn't cost an arm and a leg for the company. So that's a good example of a company that had a lot of leverage, that was able to take the money that we invested, it was a $4.5 million round, and they were able to get to sizable levels of revenue on that capital, and then that allowed them to raise a lot of growth equity at higher valuations, obviously, based on their performance.\nVN: What do you like to invest in? What are your categories of interest?\nAG: For the most part everyone at Javelin is a generalist, and that includes myself. We're looking more for opportunities that fit our fundamental business criteria, and I mentioned some of those in the previous answer.\nSo if it kind of checks the boxes on those, we'll be interested. We don' look at certain areas, like we don't look at cleantech, for instance, because it's too capital intensive. But everything else, we'll take a look at it. So we try not to predefine our categories of investing. We want the entrepreneurs to show us the path, and the paint vision of the future.\nHaving said that, we have recently invested in several themes, and this more looking backwards than forwards. So we invested in sever consumer marketplace companies, definitely a few on demand companies, the edtech education space has been a theme for us, vertically integrated e-commerce. We do also have quite a few enterprise software investments, but when we do those we typically look for companies that have very unique IP, or unique technology, that allows them to differentiate themselves.\nFor myself, again, I'm a generalist, so I've invested across all those buckets, but I've probably done a little more on the consumer side. \nPartly that's a function of my network, to be honest. Most of the entrepreneurs that I know have gone on to do consumer companies, cause that's what they're passionate about, and number one criteria, for us, in terms of investing is investing in good people. The people that are in my network that I have identified as great entrepreneurs have been doing mostly consumer companies, so it's more function of that. But I have a few enterprise companies as well that I'm involved with. We try to have an open perspective on every company. \nVN: What would you say are the top investments you have been a part of? What stood out about those investments in particular?\nAG: In general we're a young fund, we've only been around since 2009, so a lot of our companies are still growing and maturing, and we're very long term holders, like we have a very long term view, so some of these are definitely still playing out.\nOne of our best performing investments that I was a part of is Thumbtack, an online consumer marketplace for consumers and service providers across many different verticals. We led the Series A fairly early on in the company’s development before they figured out their business model or really knew how they were going to scale. What stood out to us the most was the team and their data driven approach to decision making. That’s key in any marketplace business.\nWeddington Way is a vertically integrated collaborative e-commerce platform that allows brides and bridesmaid to shop for bridesmaid dresses. They're doing very well, over $10 million in revenue, very positive unit economics, we're very bullish on what they can do.\nAnother company is Engrade, which is in the education edtech space. They were acquired by McGraw Hill about a year ago. They provided LMS and SIS software, so think of it as everything from grade-books to assessment for teachers, parents and administrators, that drill down to the student level to show how students were performing in classrooms across a variety of categories and criteria. It then allowed administrators and teachers to focus in on Common Core gaps, if there were any within the school, and improve those marks. And so the software was great, it was incredible, beautiful enterprise software, but there was also a free component too. So it was sort of a bottom up and a top down strategy in terms of distribution. So, going back to that leverage piece, they had it, because their notoriety and ability to get sales done was way more efficient because they had this massive free product that was out there.\nKitchit is another one. That's an on demand chef, essentially, at your home. So on demand dinner parties. You essentially pay $39 a person and you a high end three course meal, at your home, for anywhere from two to 12 people, that you can order the night of. And so you have this high-end experience for the cost of going out to a restaurant. And then the chef comes, they give you the courses, they prepare everything and then they clean your kitchen and leave it spotless. So it's an unbelievable value. This company's been doing extremely well over the last six months.\nI think the best thing with Kitchit is that that they created a win-win-win situation for consumers, for chefs, who are a vital part of the experience, and for the company itself, in terms of the margins that they were able to get. And that was a key reason we invested. The other big reason, and this is one of the things that stood out to us for Thumbtack as well, because both are essentially marketplace businesses, is this unbelievable focus on metrics, and data driven decision making. And so that's one of the main things we look for in investments, How focused is a company, and how well do they understand their analytics or metrics? Are they flying with the right controls in mind so they can make a bunch of different adjustments along the way and the many different optimizations, to get to that next level? With Kitchit, as well as with Thumbtack, they had this maniacal, almost religious adherence to measuring everything. And that gave us a ton of confidence.\nVN: What do you look for in companies that you put money in? What are the most important qualities?\nAG: One the key things we look for in our founders is the sense of intellectual honesty. Do they know what they don't know, and are they upfront about it? To us that means, combined with the data driven decision making, they're going to be able to identify problem area and gaps and find the right solutions over time. The opposite of that, obviously, is folks that don't know what problems exist or which challenges there really are and everything seems great to them and that's never the case. There's always thousands of hurdles to overcome in any startup before you get to the mountaintop.\nWe really do look for that intellectual honesty, that ability to take feedback, have a productive discourse with us as potential investors. It's more of that qualitative feel that we're looking for.\nThis is obviously in addition to the more quantitative things that we talked about.\nVN: What kind of traction do you look for in your startups? And can you be specific? Are you looking for a number of customers or order volume?\nAG: It depends on at which stage we're investing, because we invest anywhere from late seed to Series A. That's kind of our sweet spot. If its a seed investment we're looking less at the absolute level of traction, and we're either looking for signs of breakout growth, so fast growth, or, more importantly, to be honest, is whatever product they do have in the market, that is has really high levels of engagement with their existing customers, and existing users. So the people that are using it are using it a ton, they love it, and if you took it away from them it would be a problem. Like they wouldn't be able to do what they were doing before. We're looking for that kind of need, that maybe the numbers sometimes can indicate, If it's a consumer versus a enterprise company you look at different metrics, but it's that intensity of usage is what we're looking for. \nFor companies that are a little bit later stage, at Series A, we're definitely looking for evidence of product market fit, evidence of traction. There's not a specific number, to be honest, that we look at in terms of revenue or users. What we look for is really a process. Does this company understand, or have a repeatable process, that can get them from one level of revenue, or one level of usage, to that next stage that's going to allow them to raise a Series B and then beyond? We're looking for evidence of that repeatable process.\nObviously the higher level of traction, the higher level of confidence you have. But there's not one answer there. We've invested in companies with a million dollar run rate, we've invested in companies that that have $5 to $7 million run rates and beyond, so it just varies. \nVN: Given that these days a Seed round is yesterday's Series A, meaning today a company raises a $3M Seed and no one blinks. But 10 years ago, $3M was a Series A. So what are the attributes to get that Seed round? Since it's a \"Seed\" does it imply that a company doesn't have to be that far along?\nAG: Seed is still pretty hard to raise at that level. There's a distinction. You can raise this early seed round and call it an angel round, maybe that's in the 100K to 500K range, and that's pretty accessible, and probably the bar is as low as it's every been there because you so have many sources of capital for that. But once you start getting into the $2 to $3 million raise, and you call that a seed, it doesn't matter what you call it, it's a meaningful amount of capital. The bar is actually pretty high, I would say, even for those $2 to $3 million seed rounds.\nI think you'll find that a lot of investors at that level are looking for metrics. They are looking for, like I said before, signs of breakout growth or those really powerful engagement stats. Something that indicates that there's product market fit here. So I don't think it's actually that easy to raise a seed. And I'm defining seed the way you defined it here, in terms of $2 to $3 million. I think it's a little bit tougher because there's a lot of companies going a lot further now and investors have their pick. Investors have a lot of companies that are raising in that $2 to $3 million zone, and all those companies are showing good progress, usually have good teams and good metrics, so there's a lot to choose from. So it takes more to stand out.\nVN: What are the attributes of a company getting a Series A?\nAG: I think you definitely need to show product market fit at that point, and, as I mentioned before, I think you have to show that you figured how to distribute you product. So you have a repeatable process. Whatever that distribution strategy is, whether its sales, whether its viral marketing in some way, or paid acquisition, whatever it is you have to show that you have a machine that's working. Because the Series A capital is looking at this opportunity, saying 'Hey, I'm going to put in my money, and this money's supposed to be used to get you to a certain level of revenue that you can go out and raise a strong Series B and eventually growth equity for.' So you have to show that the machine exists, that there's a repeatable process, that's what they're going to be looking for at Series A.\nYou're also, at that point, you have to prove with a lot of certainty that you're operating in a large market. That it is very, very large. Because you're talking about larger dollar amounts, and those investors are looking for higher levels of return. So if they're putting in $8 to $10 million in a Series A, they at least a want 10x back. So you're looking for opportunities that are playing in big markets, where you can have companies that can generate returns of  $100 million or higher for a venture fund that put in $10 million, and for that you have to be operating in a large market. That's why proving out your tam is very important. You can have hypothesis around what you're tam is at the seed level, but at Series A you better have it nailed.\nVN: Given all the money moving into the private sector, I believe there's more money going into late-stage deals in 2015 than there was during the heyday, back in 2000, do you think we're in a bubble?\nAG:  I hesitate to say were in a bubble right now, because the bubble has to a large extent, already burst in the past few months. I do believe that we're at a point where private market valuations at very late stages are a bit overvalued. Primarily, and this is my opinion, you have these large hedge funds that are getting to the private market world, and they're competing with traditional growth equity venture capitalists of the past. And for them to compete on those deals, they're paying up to get them,. For those later stage players, like the hedge funds and the mutual funds, it's actually not a lot of capital for them. And because it's not a lot of capital, they're able to pay these higher valuations. The reason they're doing this is because they're essentially buying option value for companies that aren't going to be breakouts, and they want to position themselves for their IPOs. So for them it's a portfolio approach. One, or maybe a few of those companies are actually worth the valuations that growth equity paid.\nAnd so what you're seeing right now is a correction on that. The fact that a lot of these later stage investors overpaid for some of these companies, and only the true breakouts are able to keep raising more capital at higher valuations, or go public. You’re seeing the corrections happen in the public markets, as well as subsequent private rounds for companies that still haven’t hit their breakout points. Which means some down rounds, flat rounds, and even some companies running out of capital and at risk of going out of business. So I think to that extent we were in a bubble, I think that bubble has actually burst already. I've already seen this in several companies that are out there that have had their valuations slashed and are having a hard time raising capital once you start getting beyond the $500 million or so valuation mark. It's definitely tougher out there right now. So I think the bubble has already burst. \nI think it's going to be this more tamed environment for at least the next 18 months to 24 months, where you're going to a see a lot of later stage investors be a lot more conservative. But the best companies, that have the metrics and the solid, are still going to attract a bunch of capital and are still going to get high valuations. \nVN: If we're in a bubble, how does that affect your investing?\nAG: It always has an impact. Frankly, it doesn't change our process. We still look for the same things that we looked for before, and we're still trying to invest in amazing companies. I think what it does, and it does this for all investors, it sort of highlights the need to invest in companies that have strong fundamentals. That have positive economics, that are responsible when it comes to their burn rate. That, essentially, can be profitable at some point in the not so far future. So those things are always the case. I think in times like this it just highlights them even more so, and reminds everybody that, 'Hey, let's sanity check everything and make sure we're investing in the right type of businesses here.'\nBut it doesn't really change the criteria that we look for. It actually kind of aligns with Javelin's fundamentals based investing approach, because we're looking for those things anyway. We're not investing in hot sectors or things that are hot right now. We're investing in companies that have those fundamentals to begin with, and we hope we're lucky enough that we're making the right decisions and right bets that plays out over time. \nVN: Tell me a bit about your background. Where did you go to school? What led you to the venture capital world?\nAG:  I went to Stanford for undergrad, and during that I did a program called the Mayfield Fellows Program, which is a work study program that takes high potential engineering students and teaches them entrepreneurship and matches you with a VC mentor and a startup to work with over the summer. We've had some amazing people go through the program, like Kevin Systrom was in my class, and Josh Reeves from Gusto, and a few other amazing folks. So I did that, and through that I was the first employee at a company called ooma, which is a consumer electronics voice over IP company. I spent three years at that company, doing everything from product management, product development to operations, marketing, business development building out our retail footprint. And so that company raised over $70 million and in its history was backed by DFJ and Founder's Fund. It actually ended up going public a few months ago, so that was good to see.\nAs that experience was winding down I was approached by one of the investors in ooma, which was DFJ, and they asked me if I would be interested in helping them start a venture fund focused on Eastern Europe. I was born in Ukraine, I speak Russian, so that's why they thought it would be a good fit. And I'd never thought about venture before, to be honest, but this was kind of a unique opportunity. I felt like it was more of a startup to go out to Moscow, and other parts of Eastern Europe, to help raise a fund from scratch. So I was back and forth for about a year and a half, and helped raise a $120 million fund. It was DFJ Aurora. It was myself and there was a main partner, Alexandra Johnson, and I was the principal for that.\nThere was definitely some interesting things about working in Russia that didn't quite appeal to me. I thought I was going out there to work more with entreprenuers, and that was something I was most excited about. But it was a lot of ecosystem building, which is great on it’s own, but I spent more time with non-entrepreneurs than actual entrepreneurs. So that wasn't what I expected. Also, one of the things that happens in Russia is the government sets a lot of initiatives, instead of them happening organically. Like in Silicon Valley things happen organically and the government creates the right conditions, whereas in Russia it a little bit more top down. It's harder to get things done.\nSo I took a step back went back to Stanford, got my MBA, and once I did that I got connected back to the Javelin guys. They had just started Javelin.I knew one of the partners, Jed from his time at DFJ as well. He was at DFJ Gotham, which is the New York fund, and we all just hit it off. They were looking for someone with an entrpreunerual background, as well as some venture experience, and I had both. They did a great job of painting this path for me, where I would join as a principal and be able to get to partner if I did the right things and that really appealed to me. It ended up happening that way; I joined and within two years I became a partner at Javelin.\nTo be honest the reason that I joined Javelin was because the guys, first of all they're all entrepreneurs. Everyone's a former operator. So kind of having that entreprenural perspective from a venture fund, where there's no politics, there's no BS, everything is just above board, and just felt like a family to me. We run Javelin as you would run a startup, almost. And that really appealed to me. So we bring a lot empathy to the table when we work with our entrepreneurs, where we see as extensions of the management team and are very active. Constant conversations, constant brainstorming, product sessions, whatever help they need we're all over it. Very involved, and that was something that, I think, was very important and it appealed to me because I think of myself as entrepreneur first and this allowed to stay as close to it as possible.\nVN: What do you like best about being a VC? What makes you excited?\nAG:  Honestly it's the fact that we get to meet passionate people every day who have an amazing idea that they're so crazy about that they're going to dedicate at least five years of their life to it. Usually they're big visions and they're trying to change the world. It just gets me excited, it gets me invigorated, there's never a dull day, there's never a boring moment. I go into work every day knowing that I'm going to learn three or four new things about different industries, different technologies, different companies. So I never know what any day will bring and, to me, that makes this one of the best jobs in the world.\nBeyond all that, at the end of the day, I get to decide and pick who I get to work with. Which amazing entrepreneur I get to partner up with and help them hopefully build an amazing long lasting company with. I can't think of anything more exciting than that, other than starting your own company. When you don't have own great ideas, the next best thing is to be a VC.\nVN: What is the size of your current fund?\nAG:  The current is $125 million and we have about $330 million under management.\nVN: What is the investment range? How much do you put into each startup?\nAG: The inituial check size, the range is anywhere $500,000 to $4.5 million. Usually the sweet spot is $3 to $4 million.\nVN: Is there a typical percent that you want of a round? For instance, do you need to get 20% or 30% of a round?\nAG: Our target is 20 percent to 30 percent.\nVN: Where is the firm currently in the investing cycle of its current fund?\nAG: We're about half way through out third fund.\nVN: What percentage of your fund is set aside for follow-on capital?\nAG: We always reserve capital, we want to stay with a company for at least a couple of rounds in the future, so it depends on what the initial check size is but anywhere from 1x to 2x the initial investment. \nVN: What series do you typically invest in? Are they typically Seed or Post Seed or Series A?\nAG: It's more Series A than seed. It's about 70% Series A.\nVN: In a typical year how many startups do you invest in?\nAG: We Average about six to eight a year. Out of this current fund we'll get to 20.\nVN: Is there anything else you think I should know about you or the firm?\nAG: There's three partners, we're all former entrepreneurs, and we run Javelin in a very entrepreneur friendly way. We try to be very fast with our decisions, definitely don't like to play any games. If it's no, it's a quick no, if it's a yes we'll develop conviction and let entrepreneurs know and dig in right away. \nA great sign of a good partner and a good VC is how's that investor, not only in good times, but in bad times? When things are difficult. We always tell all our prospective entrepreneurs, anybody we talk to, 'Talk to any of our companies. It doesn't matter if its Thumbtack or a company that went out of business, and ask them what was Javelin is like in the hardest of times?' We're very serious about that and very serious about our reputation, especially when things get rough, which they very often do in startup land. \n \n", "deleted" : false }

It's pretty impressive. However, if you're firmly a Google Voice user, you might want to look elsewhere.\nThis project: The Ultimate Google Voice How-to Guide (2014 Edition)\nWelcome to the 2014 edition of the Ultimate Google Voice How-To Guide, presented by ZDNet's DIY-IT blog. In this article, and the baker's dozen that accompany it, you'll learn just about everything you need to know to get the most out of the Google Voice service. This guide contains a complete end-to-end update of our 2011 Google Voice guide, chock full of new ideas, completely new articles, and amazing tips.\nYou'll learn how to port your landline to Google Voice, how to set up phone handsets, how to integrate Google Voice into your iPhone and Android experience, how to set up a multi-line office, how to get the most out of using Google Voice and SMS, and even how to use Google Voice effectively and safely in your car, and lots more.\nSo brew up a cup of coffee or your favorite tea, grab a few snacks, and prepare to discover how plain 'ol phone calls are about to be transformed into something virtually indistinguishable from magic.\nThis article is a continuation of our Google Voice series. In this article, we'll look at how you can set up a complex home office with two phone lines, have multiple handsets, and enable either person to easily answer either phone line from any handset, all while using Google Voice.\nThis article assumes you've already got a working Google Voice account and it's linked to your phone. If you don't, please read the earlier articles in this series. We are also aware of the rumors that Google may end-of-life Google Voice or migrate its functionality more fully into Hangouts and, if that happens, we'll update this series with all your best options.\nOne of the reasons we're updating this article series is to give you the benefit of our long-term experience using Google Voice. In Google Voice: a cheapskate's guide to cheap VoIP , I described to our our Mark I setup for using Google Voice in a home office environment, which we started doing back in 2011 and used for about a year.\nIn this article, I'll take you through our Mark II setup, which we used for about 18 months. While the Ooma is certainly still a viable product, it's losing its integration with Google Voice. Even so, this article is worth reading to get a perspective about how these systems are changing and how our thought processes also changed over the years.\nIn the article that follows this, Google Voice and Skype: Rethinking GV and the landline handset solution, I'll take you through the Mark III setup, which is what we're using now.\nMoving on to the next phase\nMy wife and I had been using Google Voice as our primary phone system for about a year. I've got to tell you, it was pretty touch-and-go there for a while. There were times when our patience was sorely taxed, and times when my wife and I thought we'd go back to landline, despite the benefits of Google Voice.\nEven though I tried The cheapskate's guide to cheap VoIP , as it turned out, that solution sucked. The Obi device was a nice idea, but outgoing calls were always so static-filled that we got constant complaints. I knew we weren't alone, because the Obi forums were filled with similar complaints. Obi was kind enough to send me a second-generation box to look at, but by that time, we'd moved to the Ooma solution and didn't really want to experiment with Obi any further (although I have to say the people at the company were very earnest and very, very nice).\nI also knew the crappy call problem wasn't our network's fault, because Jason Perlow and I did a pile of testing over Skype and the sound quality was excellent. I thought about building out a VoIP system through Skype, but there are almost no reasonable Skype gateway devices to POTS (plain ol' telephone system) phones and those that are available are sold through some very dicey looking companies (with loads of reliability and shipment complaints). That's a shame, because Skype would have rocked, especially since I use it so heavily for the studio .\nSo Skype was out -- at least back then. As you'll see later, by rethinking the problem in a different way, Skype has become integral in our solution going forward. But it took time for that to become practical.\nIn 2012, Jason was using the Ooma, and he said he was generally happy with it. Of course, Jason wasn't trying to run multiple Google Voice lines through a single system, but I figured that Ooma was finally worth a look.\nIt's not the cheapskate's solution, but -- after a ton of tweaking and the involvement of Ooma's senior techies -- I had a pretty rockin' Google Voice solution. At least for a while.\nOoma basics\nThe Ooma Telo is a VoIP box, like the Obi. It's a box that sits between your network and a traditional phone handset or phone system. Unlike the Obi, which is fifty bucks (and no monthly fee), the Ooma Telo is $149 (it was $199 a year ago and $250 two years ago) with a variety of add-on fees for different features.\nGoogle Voice for Small Business\n", "deleted" : false }

Ryan Tate Business\nDate of Publication: 05.16.14.\nTime of Publication: 6:30 am.\n6:30 am\nThe Mobile Email App That Wants to Make Your PC Obsolete\nIllustration: WIRED\nYou know the feeling. You’re on a bus or sitting outside a coffee shop or walking down the street, reading and responding to email after email on your smartphone, and then you reach the point where your smartphone just doesn’t cut it. “I’ll deal with this when I get back to a real computer,” you tell yourself.\nJavier Soltero wants to fix that. “There’s a category of email you simply don’t deal with on your phone,” says the 39-year-old engineer and serial entrepreneur, and with his new company, Acompli , a startup based in San Francisco, he aims to close this hole in your mobile life. The company offers a new kind of mobile email app designed to “get you closer to the actions and information you need.”\n‘There’s a category of email you simply don’t deal with on your phone.’\nLaunched late last month, the app offers various shortcuts that accelerate common tasks, like letting someone know you’re running late, finding a contact you recently emailed, locating a work document that’s been bouncing around your inbox, or scheduling an appointment. And if you install it on your phone, it can tie straight into a Microsoft Exchange email server, the email system still favored by most big corporations. In other words, you can revamp your work email without help from your IT department.\nApple and Google — the giants of the smartphone world — have already remade the way we deal with work email, offering email clients on iPhones and Android devices that supplement desktop systems. This is why Blackberry — once the king of mobile email inside businesses — is now in its death throes. But Soltero and Acompli want to take this trend even further, believing that Apple and Google still don’t make our lives easy enough.\nPart of the issue, Soltero says, is that we must improve the way mobile email works with Microsoft Exchange. Web services like Gmail are already a big improvement over the past, but not everyone can make that switch. “The world doesn’t run on Google Apps,” he says. “Planet Earth runs on Exchange. For better or worse, it is the email and collaboration system in use by over 600 million people.”\nNo Stupid Ideas\nSilicon Valley may be obsessed with a very different kind of mobile app — smartphone software that deals in stuff like anonymous gossip and self-destructing pictures — but Soltero, who worked on the seminal Netscape web browser in the ’90s, see things quite differently. “I’m not the guy who’s going to go build Secret or Instagram or any of these things. That’s just not me,” he says. “Maybe being out here 20 years has jaded me to no end. I’m like: ‘That’s the stupidest fucking idea I’ve ever heard in my life.'” The real opportunity, he believes, lies in just fixing the basic things that all of us do every day.\nJavier Soltero. Photo: Ariel Zambelich/WIRED\nThe idea for Acompli arose after Soltero sold his server-monitoring company, Hyperic, which ended up in the hands of virtualization software maker VMWare. As a VMware chief technology officer, he found himself in deep in the corporate world, where everything was handled using ancient email software and other clunky tools like Microsoft PowerPoint. “It just seemed very inefficient,” he says.\nThus began a long obsession with the way people collaborate inside large corporations, or “the enterprise,” as such companies are collectively known in technology circles. After seeing the incredibly fast rise of Gentry Underood’s Mailbox — which Dropbox bought for a reported $100 million one month after launch — Soltero eventually set his sights on corporate inboxes. If you used an corporate Exchange service, it was hard to enter data. It was hard to find things. And it was hard to join your email to other apps. So he started Acompli.\nBeyond Google\nThe first incarnation of the company’s app at least begins to move things in the right direction. When writing or reading an email, you can pull up a toolbar that includes calendar and location icons. By clicking on either, you can instantly complete certain common tasks, like checking your schedule and inviting someone to a meeting, or telling someone else you’re en route to meet them and attaching your current location. The idea is that you shouldn’t have to leave your email client to perform related tasks.\nYou can also view your email in new and potentially useful ways. You can pop open a list of people you’ve recently corresponded with, or you can quickly browse the message attachments you’ve recently received.\nThough the app takes square aim at those people using Microsoft Exchange inside big businesses, it can also plug into new-age email services that operate over the web, including Google Apps, Apple’s iCloud, and, soon, Microsoft’s web services. Soltero sees the app as something that can go far beyond what you get if you get from Google and Apple.\nThe Competition\nCertainly, despite providing big improvements over older mobile email systems, tools from Google and Apple still need improving. As Soltero points out, there remains things you’d rather do on a desktop PC. But the rub here is that Google and Apple can so quickly expand their tools as well, and they have a shorter path to people’s hearts. After all, they control the phones.\n“No doubt, it’s going to be very hard to just out-feature the native clients, especially with Google not asleep at the wheel,” says Matt Murphy, a partner with big name venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, where he runs the iFund, a fund dedicated to iPhone apps. Murphy also points out that others are taking a similar tack, including a company called Any.do.\nIn Through the Back Door\nAnd that’s the way Soltero likes it. He sees nothing but horizon, believing that people would rather stay inside their email app than back and forth to other tools. He and his 20-person team look at the current version of the app as a mere starting point. The broader aim is to create an email app that does everything you can do on a desktop PC — from a single interface. “When you’re using a regular computer you don’t notice how you go from an email to a tab on your browser or another window to deal with whatever that email is asking you to deal with, whether it’s scheduling an appointment or finding a file or editing a document,” he says.\nAs for revenue, there isn’t any yet, since the Acompli app is free. But the plan is to sell tools to corporate IT staffs that will help them manage Acompli on employee phones. Like many other outfits — from Box.com to Evernote — Acompli wants to change corporate American by appealing to employees first. It’s called the “consumerization of IT.”\nThat’s how Accompli is different from companies like Good , which also seeks to remake corporate email. Unlike Acompli, Good comes through the front door at big businesses, selling both smartphone apps and management tools to IT departments. Acompli is more concerned with the people using the phones. For Soltero, these are the people who need the most help.\n", "deleted" : false }

And with two significant developments in this space just this week (more on that below), we thought it would be a good time to take a step back and look at the options currently available through the Apple App Store.\nWhat makes a “location-based” social network different than a normal one? At least as things stand today, location-based social networks run primarily on smartphones that have the ability to determine a user’s current location, usually by leveraging GPS or cellular tower triangulation. The social network then uses your location to reveal nearby friends and places of interest. See our Location Technologies Primer for additional information.\nCurrently there are six major location-based social networks available for the iPhone (click on the comparison chart to the right). All of them tell you how far away other members are from you, with most focused on helping you find your friends but some designed primarily for discovering strangers. A few of them chart the location of your friends’ on an interactive map (something I actually think all of them should do). They provide a wide range of privacy settings, but all will stop reporting your location when you simply close the application (Apple has yet to release its push notification system that will let these apps constantly report your location in the background). They also vary widely in how precisely they identify the locations of other members, although all but one of them work anywhere in the United States.\nAfter testing this entire batch, I’ve come to the conclusion that none of them is quite ready to achieve mainstream usage. I believe most, if not all, of the following things must happen before location-based social networking becomes the new “killer app”:\nThey need powerful notification systems that actively inform you when someone of interest is nearby. Such a system could be set up manually by individually indicating which friends are “of interest”. But it would be even better for the system to learn from your interactions (messages, pokes, wall posts, etc) and affiliations (profile information, common friends, groups) and automatically identify certain people you’d like to meet up with.\nThese applications absolutely need to update your location while the phone is sitting in your pocket. Right now it demands too much from users to open the application whenever they want to inform friends where they are. Serendipitous encounters would be far more common with a fully foolproof and automated location-updating system.\nWhen inviting friends to a service, you need the ability to determine which of your friends actually have a supported phone. Otherwise you’re just spamming a large number of people who matter to you and with very little yield.\nThese apps need to get more stable; they crash way too much.\nWe need more hooks into web applications so we can share our location and location-based activities not only with other mobile users but with the web at large.\nThose apps that let you see and meet strangers nearby need to highlight both friends of friends and those who share common interests and affiliations.\nThese are weaknesses shared by all of the current iPhone location-based social networking apps, each of which we cover briefly below.\nThe Veteran – Loopt\nPerhaps the most well-known of these companies, Loopt has been working for years to get its technology on a variety of phones (the iPhone being just the latest and most functional of them). It is also perhaps the most developed of the batch, and the most generic. Use it primarily to see on a map where your friends are located nearby. Restaurant and other local reviews are secondary, having been brought into the app through a partnership with Yelp . Get directions to other users, view their latest status updates (which are often accommodated with photos taken on-location), and ping them when they haven’t updated their location for awhile.\nThe Mountain View-based company has ventured into the matchmaking business this week by adding a new feature called “Mix” that shows you, for the first time on Loopt, strangers in your vicinity. You can see all of the people nearby who have turned on the Mix feature, and you can filter by types (age, gender, tags, dating status, community) as well. This is Loopt’s attempt to help people hook up at bars (an idea that gets thrown around by many entrepreneurs and has always puzzled me). But if it takes off, it may have even greater sociological effects than Loopt’s core friend-finding capabilities.\nThe New Kid On The Block – Moximity\nLaunching into private beta just this week, Moximity is a new location-based social network out of Austin, Texas that wants to help you find both your friends and local establishments. Taking Paul Bragiel’s marketing advice , Moximity is rolling out one geographical region at a time, starting with Austin itself. Everything is local – the restaurant listings, the users, and even the advertisements (yes, this is the only one of these networks actually monetizing on the iPhone right now).\nOne major quality that sets Moximity apart is the way it handles user accounts. When you join and start configuring, you don’t make “Moximity friends”. Rather, the service pulls in your contacts from Facebook (and later, other sites as well) and lets you track those of your existing friends who also use Moximity. When you post a status message, it also gets pushed out to your Facebook and Twitter accounts.\nMoximity would benefit from an interactive map that uses pins to show where your friends are located. However, unlike Loopt, which gives you the precise street address of your friends, Moximity always matches you with particular places (restaurants, stores, etc) so individual pins for users might not be appropriate. Co-founder Bryan Jones says some breed of mapping functionality will be included in the next release.\nIf you live in Austin, you can get into the service immediately by emailing your name and zip code here .\nThe Bezos, T-Mobile and iFund-Backed Contender – Whrrl\nThe best-funded of the bunch is a Seattle startup named Pelago with an app called Whrrl that centers around identifying and reviewing nearby establishments of all types. Locating friends takes a bit of a back seat to the idea that you should share Yelp-like reviews with the people you know.\nThe information about places is comprehensive. You can find cuisine types, prices, hours, phone numbers, websites, street addresses, ratings and reviews. While you can view the (5-star) ratings and reviews from every member, you’re encouraged to focus on those of your friends. When you view a friend’s profile, for example, their reviews are displayed prominently. That said, you can “fan” strangers if you like their tastes (although apparently only through Whrrl’s thoroughly developed web app ).\nWhrrl also identifies events that are going on in your area. The combination of event and place information is great but I get the feeling that this app will have to depart a bit from its “reviews” roots to become a widely embraced service. More generic social features (such as walls and notifications) are needed to get me to use Whrll when not looking to share or gather opinions.\nPelago has raised its funds from the iFund , Jeff Bezos, and T-Mobile (among others).\nThe Schmorgesborg – uLocate’s “Where”\nWhere is an iPhone app developed by a Boston-based startup called uLocate that has received a considerable amount of funding (at least $15.5 million ) over the last several years. It has everything but the kitchen sink. Along the bottom of the app is a dock-like menu that shows a variety of sub-applications, each meant to help you find something in your area:\nBuddy Beacon: find nearby friends\nGasBuddy: find nearby gas stations with low prices\nStarbucks: find nearby Starbucks franchises\nQuibblo: see location-based poll results in your area\nHeyWhatsThat: identify mountain peaks in your vicinity\nThe Skymap: learn about the stars and constellations in the sky above you\nZipcar: find pickup points for Zipcar rentals\nYelp: find nearby places listed and reviewed on Yelp\nEventful: learn about nearby events and their venues\nThe UI needs a bit of work (too many popups) but regardless, this app is handy for quickly finding the nearest of some particular thing on an interactive map (coffee, friendship, wheels, etc).\nThe Categorizer – Limbo\nLimbo is provided by a company that seems to have undergone quite a few transformations over the years. We reviewed the company in May 2006 when it was a bizarre auction service based on text messaging. Back then it was located at 41414.com and you can still see that ancestry in the current logo (just look at the reflection).\nThe app is, at its heart, more focused on locating strangers and learning about what they’re doing than any of the aforementioned apps. All users are categorized by four types: Members, Contacts, Friends, and Faves. You can opt to share your location with each or all of them, with “Members” being everyone you don’t know, “Contacts” being people pulled in from your phone’s address book, “Friends” being people more important to you, and “Faves” being the most important people to you.\nUsers are further categorized based on their current “activity” (or status). They are either socializing, eating, playing, chilling, working, feeling, or enjoying a bit of “me time”. You can view users by their particular categories on a “What” page that displays the categories in a grid.\nLimbo neither shows you your friends’ locations on a map nor gives you their exact locations (just their general regions, e.g. San Francisco). Both would make this app a lot more useful.\nThe Wall – Zintin\nZintin has gone even further in the direction of helping you communicate with strangers nearby, rather than helping you find your preexisting friends. Users in the vicinity are displayed in all-inclusive list along with their current status messages. When you select a particular user’s name, it takes you to their Wall, where short notes, photos, and scribbles can be posted by any user.\nThe Wall is the central, and pretty much only important, feature provided by Zintin (so-called “bulletin boards” are also provided but they’re essentially Walls for particular regions). If you find someone with particularly cool stuff on their Wall, you can request to exchange your contact information and meet them. But most people will just use the app to see what kind of juvenile stuff others around them have decided to share. If you’ve turned on the “allow mature content” setting, then that content is primarily explicit material, so be warned.\nZintin, which has been in development by a few Stanford CS grad students since late 2007, is mostly a curiosity at this point. However, the scribble feature, with which you can make quick doodles and post them for others, should make its way into other apps.\nThe Elephants In The Room – Facebook and MySpace\nNeither of the big American social networks have added location-aware services yet, but they’re coming . Expect them to eclipse several if not all of these services after learning from them.\n", "deleted" : false }

Now, the sequel is coming out, but in a very different world — with target platforms in the $34.8 billion mobile game market.\nDisney Interactive Games and Marvel Entertainment are launching the mobile game Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 on the iOS App Store, Google Play, Amazon Appstore, and Windows Phone. The title represents Disney’s full shift from social networks to mobile gaming, and it is one of the titles that will test just how many Marvel games fans want to play.\nIn contrast to mobile games like Kabam’s Marvel: Contest of Champions and Netmarble’s Marvel Future Fight, Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 is a turn-based role-playing game where your aim is to build a roster of Marvel heroes.\n“Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 is a game we developed in-house,” said Chris Heatherly, the head of Disney’s mobile game business, in a recent interview with GamesBeat . “Marvel: Avengers Alliance was our most successful social title to date. The sequel looks spectacular. It has a lot of depth. We’re really excited. All-new storyline that bridges the storyline from the original to the new game. We did a custom comic book with Marvel that tells the story behind it, building a bigger mythology behind some of our Marvel games.”\nAbove: Chris Heatherly, the head of Disney’s mobile games.\nImage Credit: Dean Takahashi\nIn Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2, players will assemble a team of superheroes including the Avengers, Daredevil, Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Wasp, and others to battle Ultron, Baron Strucker, M.O.D.O.K., and additional epic super villains. Commanders will team up with friends and other players from around the globe to prevail against deadly foes in story-based missions, Spec Ops, and more.\nIn this original storyline for Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2, pieces of the planet are disappearing, with entire cities vanishing without a trace. It is a mystery with a single clue: All of the disappearances are at previous sites of incursions. Villains are taking advantage of the chaos, as well as the massive deposits of Iso-8 left behind. Each player must level up heroes, customize them with special abilities, and assemble the ultimate team to take into battle.\n“The original Marvel: Avengers Alliance attracted a worldwide fan base due to its great storytelling and unique gameplay,” said Peter Phillips, the executive vice president and general manager of interactive and digital distribution for Marvel Entertainment, in a statement.  “Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 expands on the original with exciting new missions and one of the most robust character line-ups in any Marvel game.”\nPhilips will be a speaker at our upcoming GamesBeat Summit event in Sausalito, Calif., on May 3-4.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\n", "deleted" : false }

Platonic Relationships Only | Main | Hitwise UK Rankings - PlentyofFish is #1 »\nPerfectMatch.com, Duane Dahl - CEO Interview\nOPW INTERVIEW -- Oct 23, 2007 -- I last interviewed Duane in February of 2007 , and before that in June of 2005 . I asked Duane about PerfectMatch.com 's targeting, positioning, new TV placements, his plans for the future and what he thinks about Match.com launching a high-end matchmaking product. Here's my latest interview with Duane Dahl, CEO and Founder of PerfectMatch.com. - Mark Brooks\nHow is Perfectmatch different from and better than eHarmony ?\nWe pride ourselves in providing the best results to our members. We’ve worked hard to develop and refine our matching process, the Duet Total Compatibility System (Duet®), which matches members not only on similarity factors, but also on complementary factors as well. I think a significant difference in our approach is we work to be inclusive and transparent in the process, which members (generally 30+ in age) really appreciate. eHarmony has struggled a bit with the holier than thou approach – and I imagine that is driving the changes we see at eHarmony as they work to become more mainstream.  As part of this process, we lay the member’s information over the research and intelligence to ultimately present what should be excellent matches for them. We believe our matching process is superior to eHarmony’s – and I think that has been proven out by the success we’ve had – and the conversion of eHarmony members to Perfectmatch.\nAnother very important key element which our members appreciate is the supportive environment we provide. This goes beyond matching – for us it really is about being the best approach. It’s a very difficult and stressful process for many – putting yourself out there and trying to pursue a relationship is difficult. So, we work very closely with Dr. Pepper Schwartz (Pepper) to help our members put their best foot forward, to enable them to be in a position to have success. This is accomplished, in part, through our profile review system, and tips and information provided by Pepper.\nLastly, our team strives to create opportunities for members so they can extend the experience through offline events and opportunities. This is a significant component to many of the entertainment-focused promotions we’ve had over the last few years.\nDo you allow people to search on the site?\nAbsolutely. This is another of our unique differentiators. We view our members as adults who’re actively seeking long-term relationships. Although we’ve done an excellent job in creating a matching system for them, we also want our members to have the opportunity and freedom to seek out other individuals.\nOne of the really distinctive tools we give our members, in addition to traditional searches, is the ability to search on personality types directly linked to Duet®. Members have told us, via feedback, it’s very exciting for those who found themselves dating certain types to go outside the box and search for people who possess a different personality type than what they’ve traditionally been drawn to.\nAgain, I think it all just creatively weaves into our approach of putting our members in the best possible position for success.\nHas Perfectmatch been integrated into any entertainment vehicles lately, and what else do you have in the works?\nWe just finished the prime-time one hour airing of “Science of Love” with NBC. It aired on June 25th and featured Perfectmatch, Duet® and, of course, Pepper. On the plus side it was exciting because it was an opportunity for us to get involved on the ground floor in the development of a show and fully integrate the brand, our matching system and Pepper. We’re continuing to work with a couple of production companies to secure an opportunity to fully leverage and merge the internet with television programming.\nAlso, on September 21st, a film called “Good Luck Chuck”, starring Jessica Alba and Dane Cook, will hit the theaters. We have integration and placements in the film. It, looks like a hit – very funny film and nice placements for us – kudos to Lionsgate.\nAny plans for introducing instant messaging, anonymous calling, or any other communications?\nWe’ve tested instant messaging off-and-on over the past three years. Our members, who skew from early 30’s through 40’s, and even a growing segment of the 50+, just haven’t embraced instant messaging. They much prefer the more traditional email approach.\nWe are looking at numerous solutions in the area of communications. Certainly one of the related challenges all of us face in 2007 and beyond involves deliverability. We’re working to find new ways to engage our consumers, to extend their experiences and visit times on the site. We expect to have an announcement shortly on furthering the perfectmatch experience.\nWhat are your thoughts on Match.com’s new high-end matchmaking service, and do you have any plans to offer something similar?\nIt’s a natural step for the space. We think it’s a terrific idea and have been looking at it since the Kiss.com days. I would expect as we get into Q4/Q1, you’ll see us introducing something of a premium nature. We’d want to ensure that whatever premium service we offer our members, embodies our high touch approach and leverages Pepper as the leading expert in the space.\nWho is Perfectmatch ’s ideal client these days?\nAs we continue to see the site grow and the relationship/dating space evolve, we’re finding we continue to have success with the 35-year-old professional. This segment of the market continues to be a very important part, and driver of, the business. We’re having a tremendous amount of success with acquiring members who are 45+. And that’s natural when you step back, look at the evolution of the Internet, and then combine both with our messaging and approach. I think the 45-50+ member finds our message of relationship versus a casual approach to be one they can embrace. And I think it’s important to them to be in a community of like-minded people versus a community of 20-25 million people with assorted goals and desires. It’s all sorting out I think…social networking has played an important role in developing members. It used to be we depended heavily on members graduating up from Match.com , and those who hadn’t had success or were frustrated with eHarmony. Now, as the online community is introduced to consumers much earlier in life than even just five years ago, we see kids graduating from MySpace to the very casual dating and down market hook-up sites, then up to Match.com and finally to Perfectmatch and eHarmony.\nOct 23, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

Looking to capitalize on its growing user base, Xfire today appointed a new CEO, Malcolm CasSelle , and announced a new partnership through which it intends to bring its social gaming experience to China, along with the exploding gaming markets across Asia.\nCasSelle is formerly the director of Hong Kong-based Capital Union Investments, where he managed private direct investments into late-stage web companies, and was a top executive at Groupon’s joint venture with Chinese instant messaging and gaming giant Tencent, managing most of Eastern China. The new chief exec believes that there is a big growth opportunity for Xfire in the Chinese market, and he will be using his investment and management experience to forge new partnerships and business ventures for Xfire both in China and across Asia.\nTo get things started, the company is announcing a joint venture with Beijing’s “China Youth Goyor Technology Company,” which will be led by CasSelle with the goal of bringing Xfire’s services to China’s market for some 400 million gamers. In other words, this means that Xfire will be the first American company to support in-game chat tools for Chinese gamers — using Chinese characters.\nChina Youth Goyor Technology provides services to millions of Chinese college students, according to a statement , as part of the Communist Youth League’s Internet and Video Center. The Communist Youth League has a member base of over 83 million Chinese youths between the ages of 14 and 28, and its Internet and Video Center offers the only website that serves young web users in China ( youth.cn ), and which “guides the direction of young Internet users in China.”\nThis is an important in-road into the gaming market in China, allowing Xfire to tap into the droves of young Chinese web users looking to play games both on the Web and on PCs. Because Xfire already offers its social gaming experience inside 2,500 PC games, and over 21 million gamers have downloaded its app, this is right in the company’s wheelhouse.\nAs Xfire provides a social communication platform for gamers that includes group text, voice chats, and UGC-sharing tools for screenshots, videos, and live game broadcasts, it gives young gamers in China the ability to take advantage of social functionality that hasn’t yet totally infused the domestic gaming experience. It’s also huge that Xfire will be offering its services in Chinese characters, adding that much-needed locally-tailored aspect to its product — something many American companies struggle with when moving abroad, specifically to Asian markets.\nFor more, visit Xfire at home here , or check out the release here .\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

He's also the co-host of the TV show ' The Sex Inspectors ' in which couples reveal their bedroom problems and are then filmed, yes filmed, in their bedroom. The program pushes the envelope for English TV. Here's my interview with Manhunt sexpert Mr Alvear. - Mark Brooks\nHow did you become a sex expert, Michael?\nSeven or eight years ago, I was writing quirky op-ed columns. The syndicate for sex-advice columnist Dan Savage wouldn’t sell his column to gay newspapers and the editor was really angry about it. So, the editor came to me and asked me if I’d like to write the column. I picked up Savage’s book and thought it was brilliant. I started writing, the column was a hit, and I just kept expanding and syndicating it until it was in about 14 different gay newspapers. Then, it turned into a book called Men Are Pigs but We Love Bacon. That’s basically it.\nWhat do gay guys need the most advice on?\nBelieve it or not, I get more letters from people who want to have a relationship than from people who have any kind of real sexual problem. That’s been the biggest surprise for me. I get letters from people who don’t understand why they don’t have a relationship or why they’re not dating. You wouldn’t expect it from a site whose slogan is “Get On/Get Off”, but Manhunt can produce some really heartbreaking letters. I think Manhunt has become this all-purpose place whether you’re looking for a quickie or a long-term relationship. If you go to any city on the site and put in “LTR” (long-term relationship), you’ll get hundreds and hundreds of profiles. And if you put in something absolutely sexual, like “hung” or “bottom” or “top”, you’ll get about as many.\nFrom a strictly sex standpoint, the biggest questions are about anal sex. Also, a lot of the “problems” in the bedroom tend to actually exist outside the bedroom. I get a lot of questions about how can I get my boyfriend to do something, how can I get my boyfriend to stop doing something, how can I get a boyfriend period. I’ve written advice columns for both straight women and gay men and I noticed how much more graphic gay men are when phrasing their questions. A lot of their questions are a little X-rated, but at least you get to the heart of the matter very quickly.\nWhat do straight women need the most advice on?\nThe top two sexual issues for women are lowered libidos and a loss of sensation. With men, the two biggest issues are premature ejaculation, if you’re under 30, and impotence after 40. In terms of the relationship questions, there is almost no difference between men and women. The absolute biggest relationship issue is what I call desire discrepancy. That’s when you’re hot for sex and your partner’s not and the person with the low desire feels harassed and pressured and the person with the high libido feels rejected and abandoned. It creates a real dilemma for couples.\nAny other interesting questions?\nSome people ask how they can use the site better to attract people. I don’t think it’s that much different than going to a bar. If you have a picture of nothing but your body and your body parts, then you’re making it really hard to interest someone, unless you’re just looking for anonymous sex. Some people want to date someone, but they’re not willing to put up their face picture. Others put up face pictures, but they’re not smiling. Would you go up to somebody in a bar who wasn’t smiling and not looking at you? I think the same rules apply.\nWhat’s the craziest question you’ve ever had?\nThe most interesting question I’ve gotten was from a guy with two good friends who had never met each other before. One of them was HIV positive and the other was HIV negative. They all went out one night and sparks were flying. It was clear the two friends went home together and the guy felt guilty and wanted to know if he should have told his HIV negative friend that the other one was positive. I’ve gotten HIV questions before, but they’re about how to tell, when to tell, those sorts of things. This was the first time I had gotten a question from a guy in the middle, and so I thought that was very interesting. It was all about divided loyalties.\nAlright, as for the craziest one. This white guy goes home with a black guy. The black guy gives him a condom and the white guy freaked out when he put it on because the condom was black. He thought the guy had put ink on his dick or something. So, he freaks out and rips it off and the black guy gets all insulted and thinks he brought home a racist. But, the white guy just didn’t know that condoms come in darker colors.\nI think every online dating site should have a sex-advice column because when you’re dealing with romance and dating, you’re dealing with sex. And there is so much ignorance out there. There is so much fear, alienation, and isolation. People will ask me medical questions because they’re not “out” to their doctors yet. One guy wanted to know if his hemorrhoids where from God punishing him for having anal sex.\nIn the beginning, Manhunt was divided about content. Would people really read the content? But, it’s been a phenomenal success. Six months into it, every two weeks I get an aggregated list of questions and the last one filled up 31 pages of a Word document. And this was on a site that never had content before. Unlike other sites, where you have to go through nine layers to even figure out where their column is, Manhunt puts me in a very prominent position and does so in a way that doesn’t interfere with the basic premise of why people are there. They’ve designed and marketed it well, and that’s part of Manhunt’s brilliance.\nWhat other sites do gay guys use? Match , Yahoo! Personals ?\nWe use everything. I think absolutely there’s a stronger preference for the gay sites, but you have to cover all your bets. Most people I know belong to more than one online dating service. I haven’t looked at the statistics, but I’d be shocked if there weren’t a very significant number of people who belong to more than one.\nSep 15, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

With IMVU, users create their own 3D character, or avatar, and can then meet people, chat, create virtual goods and share them, and play games.\nThe company is one of the few surviving virtual world startups that have grown a big audience and generated a lot of revenue. Keeping the growth going isn’t easy. But the European expansion should help. IMVU will now have localized versions in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.\nThe launch will start with a Swedish version, and the other six languages will roll out in the coming weeks. The company plans to continue its international expansion into 2011, said IMVU chief executive Cary Rosenzweig.\nAlready, 11 million of IMVU’s 50 million registered users are in Europe. The good thing about IMVU is that while other companies have cut back and gone under, it has kept growing by trying out new things. As management teams go, this company’s leaders are proactive. They aren’t sitting still waiting for the recession to take its toll. The company recently added the Mac to its platform and launched its first iPhone app, IMVU2Go.\nIMVU announced in September that it intended to pivot from its status as a virtual world to a social gaming company, since virtual worlds are on the wane. Linden Labs’ Second Life has long been the stand-out virtual world, but it lost its founder, CEO, and a lot of its employees this year. Other virtual worlds, from Vivaty to Metaplace, have shut down .\nIMVU was founded in 2004, has more than 10 million unique visitors a month, and, based on interviews earlier this year, is generating revenue on a $40 million-per-year run rate. In 2009, the company hit $25 million in revenue . Its virtual goods catalog has more than 4 million items, most of them created by its own members. The number of virtual items grows by 5,000 every day. In the last 30 days, 30,000 users sold something to other members. About 85 percent of revenue comes directly from consumers, who pay for virtual currency.\nIMVU’s backers include Menlo Ventures, Allegis Capital, Bridgescale Partners and Best Buy Capital. Rivals range from Second Life in the virtual world business to Zynga and hi5 in social games. The company has 101 employees.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

Even the company says so.\nBy Bonnie Cha Sep 24, 2014, 8:00a\nLinkedin\nVjeran Pavic\nTo say that BlackBerry has had a rough go of it over the past few years would be an understatement. A failure to innovate at the pace of Apple and Google, losing sight of its core audience and numerous executive changes are just some of the reasons the once-dominant smartphone maker is struggling in today’s competitive market. (It’s not a good sign when you tell someone you’re testing a new BlackBerry and their response is, “They still make those?”)\nBut BlackBerry is hoping to right its ship by going back to its roots and focusing on business customers, starting with the new BlackBerry Passport.\nBuilt with the power user in mind — doctors, lawyers, bankers, government workers — the Passport includes some useful new features, like a voice-enabled virtual assistant similar to Apple’s Siri and Google Now. It has an extra-wide screen that makes it great for viewing emails and documents. And of course there’s also the beloved physical keyboard, which now doubles as a touchpad.\nAvailable today from BlackBerry’s website and from Amazon, the Passport’s off-contract price of $599 is even lower than the iPhone 6 ($649), iPhone 6 Plus ($749) and Samsung Galaxy S5 ($649). AT&T will also offer the smartphone, but the carrier has not announced pricing or an availability date yet. BlackBerry expects the phone to cost around $250 with a two-year service agreement.\nDespite all this, the Passport’s chance of appealing beyond the BlackBerry faithful is slim. And even some BlackBerry users might eschew the phone due to its bulky design.\nTechnically, the Passport isn’t a phablet since its screen is smaller than five inches, but it’s still large with a blocky shape. In some ways, I almost found it more difficult to manage than other phablets like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and iPhone 6 Plus, because it’s so wide at 3.56 inches across.\nI had a hard time wrapping my hand around it. Admittedly, I have small hands, so I let a couple of my guy friends try it out, and they agreed that it was uncomfortable to hold. The phone is also not very pocket-friendly.\nBlackBerry is the first to admit that the Passport isn’t for everyone. And for those who crave a smaller form factor, the company is planning to release a more traditional model called the BlackBerry Classic later this year.\nThere is a reason for the Passport’s shape, though, and that’s the 4.5-inch, 1,440 by 1,440-pixel touchscreen. The square screen is 30 percent wider than the average five-inch smartphone, allowing it to display 60 characters across, compared to 40 characters on a five-inch device.\nThis did lead to a better experience for reading text. When viewing emails, I was able to see more of the message at a glance on the Passport than on the iPhone 6. The same was true of Web pages and Word documents. Apps like Twitter and Facebook also scaled fine to the square screen, but watching video was another story.\nWhen I switched to full-screen mode in Netflix, the scenery on the left and right sides got cut off. Meanwhile, in YouTube, there was a lot of black space above and below the picture.\nWith the screen dominating much of the device, the Passport’s keyboard now has three rows of physical buttons rather than the usual four. When I first started using the phone, it took me a while to acclimate to the narrower layout.\nBut BlackBerry has added some smart features around the keyboard. Depending on what application you’re using, the Passport will display a row of virtual keys on screen to help you complete your task. For example, when composing emails, it shows punctuation symbols. But if you switch over to the Maps application, it displays number keys, knowing that you’re most likely going to enter a street number.\nSecond, the keyboard now acts as a touchpad. You can gently swipe your finger in different directions to delete entire words, move the onscreen cursor, and more. I found it particularly useful for scrolling through Web pages and minimizing apps.\nThe Passport ships running the latest version of the company’s operating system, BlackBerry 10.3. One of the new features of the OS is the voice-controlled BlackBerry Assistant.\nBy holding down the mute button on the right side of the phone, you can speak different commands and ask questions like, “What’s the weather like today?” While I didn’t do an extensive comparison against Siri , Google Now or Microsoft’s Cortana , BlackBerry Assistant capably handled all of the requests I threw at it, including searching for specific emails, launching applications and displaying sports scores.\nThe Passport is also the first BlackBerry device to come preloaded with Amazon’s Appstore , so you can download Android apps that have been tweaked to run on the BlackBerry OS. It helps broaden the selection of what’s available in the limited BlackBerry World app store, as I was able to download titles like Netflix, Fitbit and Pocket.\nSecurity has always been one of BlackBerry’s strongpoints, and the Passport continues that tradition with tools for both you and your company’s IT department. This includes remote lock and wipe, control over apps permissions, on-device and data encryption.\nLike many of today’s high-end smartphones, the Passport has a quad-core processor, but it didn’t feel quite as responsive as some other handsets I’ve tested. There was a slight lag when opening applications and refreshing pages. There were also several occasions where the Passport briefly froze.\nFor example, when trying to respond to an email, I kept hitting the reply button, and nothing happened for a few seconds. The phone’s main 13-megapixel camera was also slow to focus, and picture quality wasn’t as good as on the iPhone 6 or Galaxy S5.\nVoice calls made on AT&T’s network sounded clear, but like a lot of phablets I’ve tested, I had to adjust the position of the phone a few times to get the earpiece in the right place to hear my friends. BlackBerry built a microphone into the earpiece that’s supposed to boost audio even if the earpiece isn’t in the right spot, but I didn’t notice any difference. Speakerphone quality was good on both ends of the conversation.\nBlackBerry estimates the Passport’s battery life at about 30 hours. While I didn’t run a formal battery test, the Passport lasted a little over 24 hours with moderate to heavy usage. But you’ll still need to recharge this phone every night.\nFor current BlackBerry users, and businesses using the company’s devices, the Passport brings some nice additions and the choice of a wide-screen phone. But if you’re already invested in other platforms, there’s no reason to switch.\nrecode_divider\n", "deleted" : false }

Just send us an email .\n \nFriday Feedback\nGreetings from Boston, where our skies are cloudy, our tunnels are leaky and our Wall-Marts are overrun with unsold Elmo dolls. In other words, it’s time for Friday Feedback. No real theme this morning, just a bit of sweet-smelling potpourri:\nFirst up are the legions of PR reps who strongly disagree with yesterday’s derision of press releases. Joan suggests that I actually “harbor a secret adoration for press releases, or else [I] would have never started the PE Week Wire.” Brian adds: “Corporate press releases are like poetry; more people write them than read them.”\nDelving into the more substantive part of yesterday’s column was regular respondent Tony, who writes: “Regarding the Metabolex piece, [Alta Partners’ Ed] Penhoet has the money, so he gets the chairman position. So what? You make it sound like he has some sort of Midas touch. He doesn’t know more than you or I, he just has the money. If something good comes to Metabolex, it is because the product has finally been shown to work, not because of Penhoet. You give these guys way too much credit.” Perhaps you’re right, Tony, but there are two things worth pointing out here: (1) Penhoet somehow convinced Metabolex to take money today at a relatively low valuation, whereas it could have gotten a far better deal in two months, assuming the Phase II trials go well. If they don’t go well, the whole company will be virtually worthless anyway, so it’s a wash. (2) I don’t think the issue is Midas touch, so much as it is experience. Penhoet recently was intimately involved in the year’s most successful public exit for a biotech IPO, and lessons learned there could prove invaluable to Metabolex. No, it’s not everything, but it is a significant something.\nFinally, Jeff asks a question in regard to a column from last week: “Please explain why you think mega-LBO funds will not perform well in the future. I read what you are writing, but you do not explain it. I would argue that large buyout deals are much better investments in that you can at least get out of them through dividends and IPOs as they are real companies with products, customers and cash flow [as opposed to VC investments].”\nThis probably deserves an entire column, Jeff, but the short answer is as follows: The typical argument here is that historical returns for mega-buyouts – defined as deals greater than $1 billion – are lower than those of early-stage VC, mid-market buyouts or any other comparable private equity transaction class (based on Thomson Venture Economics benchmarks). This certainly is relevant, but let’s look forward instead of backward. The mega-buyout market I see right now is severely overcapitalized, and getting more so.\nEmail Dan Primack\nThomas H.

Most of this is simply to fill the Wire’s news section, but every now and then I run into what I refer to as a “predictor press release,” which basically means that something bigger and more interesting is just around the corner. For example, when Fidelity Ventures recently announced the hiring of a new venture partner, I immediately suspected that the firm also had raised its new fund. It had, this space reported the scoop, and a press release quickly followed. Similar situation with North Bridge Venture Partners, which announced a new general partner last week. No fund close yet, but it likely will come next quarter, even though sources say it will be one of those “insider-only” affairs due to anticipated oversubscription from existing limited partners.\nAnyway, all of this brings us to the predictor press release I completely failed to pick up on: the announcement in early October that Ed Penhoet, a director with Alta Partners, was stepping down from his chairman position on the board of Eyetech Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: EYET). My take was that this was a typical case of late-stage VC makes an investment, gets on the company’s board, helps execute a wildly successful IPO and aftermarket performance, and then steps down from the board in order to refocus on private companies. All of that was accurate, but I put absolutely no effort into figuring out which private company would replace Eyetech on Penhoet’s to-do list. All apologies, dear readers.\nThe answer is Metabolex Inc., a Hayward, Calif.-based company that focuses on the Type II diabetes market. Specifically, it is developing a drug that increases insulin sensitivity in both fat and muscle tissue, but supposedly without the nasty side effects (such as weight gain and occasional congestive heart failure) that can come with already-commercialized “insulin sensitizers” like Actos and Avandia. Like EyeTech’s compound that focuses on macular degeneration (i.e., a form of vision impairment/blindness), the Metabolex drug could be a billion-dollar story, and the sole basis for a successful public company.\nIt’s important to note, however, that Metabolex has been working on this drug for over 12 years. It was seeded in 1992 by Charter Ventures, and raised $80 million through 2002. What it didn’t do, however, was secure a decent development partnership with a big pharma company, so it essentially became a discovery and development company, without ever really laying the proper groundwork. By late 2002, it became clear that the company needed to be restructured and recapped. The CEO got canned, all of the existing VC rounds got collapsed into a single “Series A” deal and the Phase II clinical trials were suspended indefinitely, in order to preserve existing financial resources. Eight months later, it launched a three-part Series B round, which culminated in a $44 million infusion last week led by Alta and Penhoet, who is the company’s new chairman.\nFormer chairman Barr Dolan of Charter Ventures stepped down, as the funds that originally invested in Metabolex are essentially out of cash (due to their age). He says, however, that Charter still believes in the company, and that he is among those betting that Penhoet can help do for Metabolex what he helped do for Eyetech. He also points out that Alta made a very savvy move by insisting on making its investment last week, just about two months before Metabolex finishes its Phase II clinical trials. If the results are as strong as expected, Alta – not to mention fellow new investors Venrock, Versant and Novo AS – will have gotten one heck of a bargain, as the company’s valuation would skyrocket. Metabolex probably should have secured some interim bridge financing and waited for its results, but Dolan says that Metabolex felt unable to turn down money on the table. Likely good for Alta, probably bad for di! luted company management.\nEmail Dan Primack\nHicks, Muse, Tate & Furst has completed its $405 million acquisition of Regency Gas Services LLC, Dallas-based midstream gas gathering, processing and transmission company.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5725fc8eb3c1e50001a270e3" }, "companyIDs" : [ "ideal-bite" ], "title" : "Earnings: Disney Interactive Revenues Up 13 Percent But New Segment Turns In A Loss", "date" : { "$date" : "2009-02-04T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "URL" : "https://gigaom.com/2009/02/03/419-earnings-disney-interactive-revenues-up-13-percent-but-new-segment-turn/", "content" : "1 Comment\nWhile everyone else looks at the big picture — The Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) Company runs into the economic version of the law of gravity — we’ve been waiting for a different set of numbers: Interactive Media, reporting as a segment for the first time and the results are mixed. Interactive Media revenues rose 13 percent to $313 million, but segment operating income dropped $58 million to a loss of $45 million.\nOverall, the company reported an 8 percent drop in revenue to $9.5 billion from $10.4 billion the previous year and a 32 percent decrease in profit, to $845 million from $1.25 billion. Disney earned 45 cents per share for the holiday quarter, down 29 percent from 63 cents last year; analysts polled by FactSet Research (via MarketWatch ) expected Disney to post a profit of 52 cents a share on revenue of $10.1 billion.\nAdvertisement\nThe new segment represents the Disney Interactive Media Group, headed by Disney digital vet Steve Wadsworth and formed last year by the merger of the Disney Interactive Group with video gaming unit Disney Interactive Studios, and “certain new business initiatives.” The chief operating businesses are Disney Online and DIS. It does not include the results for ABC.com, ESPN.com, among others — that means it does not reflect a large portion of the company’s revenue from digital media sales. When the segment results came up during the earnings call , CEO Bob Iger said the company would continue to invest in video games and that the virtual worlds and mobile content areas are closer to profitability. More after the jump.\nAdvertisement\nThe company attributed the decrease “primarily” to a decline at Disney Interactive Studios ” as higher sales volume was more than offset by an increase in unit cost of sales and higher marketing expenses in the current quarter.” DIMG also manages Disney-branded mobile and provides the tech infrastructure for ABC.com, ESPB.com, Disneyshopping,com, the theme parks online, etc. DIMG gets paid for those services but the sites are managed from their respective groups and their results are included in the relevant segments.\nAdvertisement\nThrough last year, DIS and WDIG results were folded in with Consumer Products and Media Networks, respectively; new business initiatives were reported in corporate and unallocated shared expenses. Along with earnings results today, Disney filed an amended annual report for the year ended Sept. 28, 2008. The change provides a peek into the company’s interactive activity over the past 28 months. Some items of note:\nAdvertisement\n— FY08: Interactive Media increased revenues 47 percent to $719 million from $490 million in FY07. DIS contributed the bulk of the increase — $160 million — due to new self-published video games (an important initiative for the company) for High School Musical, Hannah Montana and Turok. (The previous year’s releases were Pirates of the Caribbean, Spectrobes and Meet the Robinsons.) Disney Online’s revenue increased $71 million aided by the first year of full revenue from virtual world Club Penguin.\nAdvertisement\nBut costs, including video game and internet content development, rose 25 percent for the fiscal year, to $974 million. For instance, Disney Online benefited from Club Penguin on the rev side, but it was also the first full year of carrying the virtual world’s costs, while the increased emphasis on developing video games meant more investment. The $258 million loss was tempered by an unlikely source — lower costs for mobile services following the shut down of the Disney MVNO in the first quarter — and decreased 11 percent over FY07.\nAdvertisement\n— Not a profit center yet: During eight quarters in FY08 and FY07, Interactive Media operations showed a profit only once — $13 million in Q108, on revenues of $276 million.\nAdvertisement\n— New businesses: Think Digisynd, Ideal Bite. A Disney spokesman wasn’t naming names but added some explanation: “The emerging businesses referenced are a number of small acquisitions and some internal projects that allow us to participate in new forms of interactive media content and services. The businesses are managed separately from the rest of DIMG and are seen as incubation investments.”\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

It’s not exactly a vote of confidence for the short-term plans of algae-based biofuel startups to bring a cost-competitive replacement for fossil fuels to market.\nThe move — first reported via anonymous sources by Greentech Media last month —makes sense, given the startup’s strengths. Alameda, Calif.-based Aurora’s main technological advantage lies in the work they’ve done to selectively breed strains of algae. Those strains are higher in omega-3 fatty acids than most, and can also out-grow typical strains by a factor of two to one in pilot ponds in Florida and Mexico, CEO Gregg Bafalis tells me. Otherwise, the company is using technologies that have been around for decades: open raceway ponds, well-known algae harvesting crushing techniques, conversion into omega-3 EPA for pharmaceuticals and high-protein feed for fish farms and other purposes.\nAdvertisement\nBut while Aurora had first hoped to take its better-growing algae straight to biofuels, it’s decided that the technology for doing so is “really at least several years out,” Bafalis told me. Monday’s shift has been presaged by big changes in the company, with CFO Joe Geesmand and CEO and former Shell veteran Robert Walsh leaving in February, and the company raising $15 million and appointing new CFO Scott McDonald in March. Bafalis, a veteran of both the traditional energy industry and biofuel startup Green Earth Fuels, joined the company in June.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m familiar with biofuels and living off of government subsidies,” he said. “When I joined this company I was concerned with building a business on fundamentals that could stand on their own.” The company hopes to have its first demo facility in Australia, which will use CO2 from natural gas and fertilizer plants to grow algae in eight 1-acre ponds, operating by year’s end, and plans to get to commercial scale by the first quarter of 2013, Bafalis said. While the company does hope to see biofuel made from its algae in the future, that’s off the table for current commercialization plans, Balfalis said.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a hard fact that no algae biofuel company can claim cost-competitive production to date. The key challenges lie in cost-effective ways to harvest the algae from water, and convert it into fats for conversion to fuel, without using more energy at higher cost than you’d yield from the final fuel product.\nAdvertisement\nOther algae startups have targeted markets outside fuel to get started. Solazyme , which has technology for growing algae in the dark by feeding it sugar, has been working to adapt its algae oils for consumer products giant Unilever to replace palm oi l, and last week said it had received an undisclosed investment from the consumer products giant. The insight isn’t limited to algae-based biofuels. Khosla Ventures-backed LS9 has a deal to produce industrial chemicals for Procter and Gamble , even as it has continued to claim breakthroughs in turning cellulosic materials into fuels.\nAdvertisement\nThese smaller markets could help biofuel companies in their challenge to compete with the fossil fuel industry on its own terms. Not only must biofuels compete with their fossil fuel equivalents, they also have to be able to scale production to the billions of gallons. Without that kind of scalability, most algae biofuel companies are just “playing” with their investors money, according to Craig Venter , whose Synthetic Genomics is in a $600 million algae biofuel research program with ExxonMobil.\nAdvertisement\nFor more on greentech financing check out GigaOM Pro (subscription required):\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Otherwise, why is anyone going to commit the assets to build a plant,\" Radany said. \"The cost of manufacturing the traditional way has gone up with the rising cost of petroleum and it's a very noxious process.\"\nChemicals get less attention than fuels but they represent a large potential market. Amyris, which recently signed a contract manufacturing deal to make chemicals and fuels from sugar cane in Brazil, estimates that the specialty chemicals market is about $400 billion annually compared to jet fuel which is over $1 trillion, according to Jeri Hilleman, the chief financial officer of Amyris. In its first large-scale plant in Brazil, it will make farnesene, a hydrocarbon which is used for cosmetic products and lubricants.\n\"We absolutely see ourselves as a biofuel company as well as a renewable chemical company. But we can produce chemicals with positive gross margins today whereas fuels will take a little more time to bring production costs down,\" said Hilleman. \"We can sell chemicals more quickly and profitably than fuels.\"\nGreen chemistry\nOut of a given barrel of oil, a significant portion--on the order of 15 percent--goes to products other than diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, or heating oil, according to the Energy Information Administration . Many biofuel companies, such as Joule Unlimited and Kior , will first target the fuels market, but over the years a number of companies have sidestepped the challenges of supplying fuel by focusing on renewable chemicals or other products.\nAurora Algae, once called Aurora Biofuels, last year switched gears away from diesel replacement to food products , including animal protein, feed, and Omega 3 oils.\nSolazyme, which grows algae in industrial fermenters, is spreading its bets across fuels, food oils, and skin care products. Codexis, which went public last year, has a diversified \"green chemicals\" strategy applying its specialty enzymes technology to make low-carbon biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals.\nA number of companies are making biofuels and renewable chemicals using industrial fermenters where genetically engineered microbes, such as bacteria, secrete the targeted chemical. Genomatica\nBiotech companies that use genetic engineering say they can modify their microorganisms to make different products. Synthetic biology company LS9, for example, has genetically modified bacteria to produce replacements for gasoline or diesel. Using the same fermentation process with different \"designer microbes\" yields chemicals for consumer goods products through a partnership with Procter and Gamble .\nThis sort of pattern will play out as renewable chemical companies seek a profitable niche as they eye the larger fuel market, say industry watchers. It's an approach that could help biofuels other than corn ethanol get a commercial foothold.\nCertain molecules typically refined from oil serve as \"building blocks\" for other products, according to Gevo CEO Pat Gruber. Using sugar or cornstarch, the company's genetically engineered yeast makes isobutanol and similar chemicals used in making rubber, plastics, or kerosene.\nTo avoid the large upfront cost of building new biorefineries, Gevo's strategy is to retrofit corn ethanol plants with its equipment to make its chemicals. The chemicals themselves are identical to those made from oil, making them seem less risky to potential customers.\n\"We don't do anything new except that it's renewable, cheaper, and cleaner. And we expect the cost of oil will go up faster than our (carbohydrate) raw materials.\" said Gruber. \"Making chemicals instead of fuels is just a pragmatic thing.\"\nVerdezyne has parallel efforts to use its yeasts to improve the yield on ethanol production and to make adipic acid. It sees petroleum suppliers, or chemical companies which consume large amounts of oil, as potential customers mostly for economic reasons. \"There's some market pull for being green but ultimately it comes down to price and performance,\" said Radany.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

The startup is nearly out of money, and Schorsch says that unless it can raise more funding by the end of April, it will have to shut down on April 30.\nTrusera launched ten months ago, offering users a community where they can share their stories about how they’ve dealt with health conditions. Instead of simply segmenting users into different groups according to the disease they are dealing with, Trusera also takes other information into account, including a user’s hobbies, location, and age. Using this data it tries to match users up with each other, so that their experiences and tips can be shared with the people who stand to gain the most from them. The other benefit of this matching system is that users can elect to receive Email updates whenever a new match submits a story or tip, which means that users don’t have to worry about constantly searching the site for new information.\nTrusera is well designed, with a friendly interface that lends a sense of community that makes the site seem like more than just a reference guide. It also has a few innovative features in the works, like a writing assistant that offers users tips as they write about their experiences (Schorsch assures me that it is nowhere near as annoying as Microsoft’s infamous Clippy).\nBut while it has grown a dedicated user base, it is still fairly small (which isn’t too surprising given that it has been around less than a year). The site faces off with a plethora of competitors in this space, which include everything from similar online portals to more basic forums. Many sites also revolve around individual diseases, which can further segment these communities.\nWhile Trusera may be forced to close at the end of next month, Schorsch says that the company will continue to maintain the website content and platform on private servers, which they can reactivate down the line should they come across new funding.\n", "deleted" : false }

But the proliferation of smartphones that have cameras, displays, and even GPS and other sensors on them has enabled a whole host of new mobile applications — Soundwalk , Wikitude and Layar , for example — that offer a glimpse at how online digital information and offline physical worlds could be combined. With such tools, virtual and real worlds have moved one step closer to one another.\nBut we are set to move much further. Over the next decade, augmented reality will shift toward “mixed reality,” enabling immersive applications and shared experiences that will change how computers are positioned in our lives.

This week, Interpublic Group, one of the big three ad holding companies, will unveil details about its new social media unit, Rally.\nRally will be charged with conceiving ad campaigns around social media, as well as measuring buzz and effectiveness about clients’ brands, the WSJ reported . The new unit will be headed by Heidi Browning, who left MySpace (NSDQ: NWS) as SVP for insights and planning last October to take on the role of global digital officer for IPG’s Universal McCann.\nAdvertisement\nPublicis Groupe is also in the process of starting a dedicated social media unit within its digital hub, VivaKi. The new social media unit will pull in executives from around the agency to spur more collaboration. It should be up and running by the end of the year.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the ad agencies build up their social media bona fides, they’re also seeing increased competition from an unfamiliar quarter. Meredith (NYSE: MDP), which last week bought up the remaining shares of mobile marketer The Hyperfactory , has seen its New Media Strategies subsidiary attract a lot of business lately from blue chip clients like Chrysler and Domino’s Pizza.\nAdvertisement\nPR agencies are also challenging agencies for social media business to some extent. But ad agencies and PR firms are likely to be hampered somewhat in their attempt to include social media marketing as a distinct business. Rather than coming up with clever taglines and eye-catching creative, or in simply reaching out to blogs with news about a client, social media marketing is largely about customer relationship management. In the case of Domino’s, it decided to go with NMS, the Meredith unit, because it specialized in word-of-mouth marketing.\nAdvertisement\nStill, the big agencies do possess one considerable advantage: their continued deep pockets, which allow them to target startups who appear to have figured out the social media space for acquisitions. M&A activity around marketing services led to a boost in deals over the first half, and while the economy remains shaky, the third and fourth quarters are likely to experience a particular uptick in transactions by agencies around social media.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

TripSay combines travel search with user-generated travel guides and ratings. When you enter a city or place, it comes up on a map, along with recommendations from other TripSay users that can be sorted by restaurants, hotels, bars, beaches, transportation, sights, and other categories. I described the service in my initial review:\nTripSay combines social recommendations with a travel search engine that auto-suggests cities, pubs, hotels, and the like as you type them in. They appear as icons on a map, with a photo (pulled from Flickr) and description on the side, a tag cloud below, and minifeed of all the places you and your friends have rated or recommended.  The detail page for each city shows other TripSay members who have visited, tips from members, the most interesting Flickr photos tagged with the name of the city, links elsewhere on the Web, and a list of the top-rated places shown on a map.\nSince then, the site has added a few more features, including better editing tools, ways to collect and save your favorite tips, group message boards, and the ability to filter recommendations by groups. And, of course, it’s kept its signature rating system, which goes from smiley face to a full moon. TripSay competes with Dopplr , Driftr , and many other social travel sites, but it is worth a look.\n", "deleted" : false }

Andrew Reichman breaks down the Engenio acquisition.\n| Topic: Hardware\nYesterday, NetApp announced the acquisition of the Engenio storage division of LSI for $480 Million.  Engenio is mainly known as an OEM provider of storage systems with a broad partner list that includes IBM, Sun, Blue-Arc, Teradata, Panasas, RAID Inc., SGI  and Huawei.\nThis move follows a busy year of storage acquisitions with HP, EMC and Dell each spending more than a Billion Dollars on buys in the space.  $480 Million represents the biggest acquisition ever for NetApp, more than they spent this past year on Bycast and Akorri, or previously on Onaro, Topio, Decru or Spinnaker.\nMost of the money in storage acquisitions has gone to software that can be mated to industry standard (or nearly standard) hardware, but this deal goes in a different direction with LSI being a vendor known for meat and potatoes Fibre Channel storage hardware without a lot of frills.  NetApp is largely a software company that sells OEM hardware running their DataONTap operating system, chock full of some of the most features and protocol options in the industry.  Focusing on differentiated software has allowed NetApp to enjoy high margins and a consistent, unified family of products from entry level to enterprise class.  So why would NetApp want to jump into the fairly commoditized storage hardware business?\nNetApp says that the Engenio products will be a separate offering from DataOnTap aimed at opening new vertical markets they haven’t had success with; areas where bare bones LSI products have had more success such as video surveillance, video game rendering and other bandwidth intensive apps.  These businesses generally want fast unfettered access to lots of disk on the cheap, without caring much about ease of use or willing to tolerate the performance overhead or cost of advanced features; a model that NetApp really can’t deliver with current products.  So NetApp would be able to address a new market segment, but one that is largely price driven with ultra-thin margins.  Hardly seems worth their while to break away from the unification and software value stories they’ve been telling for years.\nThe unspoken story here could be that NetApp is tired of not being able to control pricing and roadmap on core products and having to share margins with current OEM partners Xyratex and Dot Hill.  Maybe vertically integrating from software-only into hardware could get them a bigger piece of the pie and more control of their destiny by building their own gear.  Also, as NetApp continues to explore architecture options like V-Series, Cluster-Mode and Virtual Storage Architecture (VSA, aka DataONTap in a VM), more flexibility in selecting and packaging drive units for control by various DataOnTap software incarnations will come in handy.  NetApp CEO Tom Georgens worked at LSI previously, so he probably knows what he’s getting into.  What’s more, NetApp has piles of cash after multiple consecutive high growth quarters- a nearly $5 Billion war chest.  Finally, LSI’s revenue from storage systems is steadily above $200 Million per quarter, which makes $480 Million look attractive as a purchase price, although preserving that revenue is not guaranteed going from neutral LSI to competitive NetApp.\nIn terms of LSI’s existing partners, the most interesting to NetApp is likely to be Teradata, a relationship that could strengthen NetApp’s position in data warehouse and business intelligence, hot categories that have seen acquisitions from EMC of Greenplum and IBM of Netezza, as well as pressure from Oracle’s Exadata.  The IBM OEM relationship could go either way- IBM sells a substantial quantity of LSI systems as their DS5000 line, probably LSI’s biggest partnership, and they also resell everything NetApp makes as their N-series.  The deal could strengthen the IBM-NetApp relationship, but there’s an off chance it could disrupt the negotiating balance and destabilize things.  BlueArc and Panasas are competitors to NetApp, so they are unlikely to stick around and Oracle/Sun’s continued commitment to their 6000 series is unclear.  The rest of the partners probably could go either way, but some could be good channel builders in new markets or geographies.\nIn the deal, NetApp left behind OnStor, NAS gateway software purchased by LSI in 2009, but kept the StoreAge virtualization and replication software bought by LSI in 2006 (which was previously resold by HP as their SVSP product but subsequently cancelled).\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

Among other things, wireless specialist Aruba added Ethernet switches to its architecture and Meraki took administration of both network components into the cloud. Rivals Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Cisco Systems snapped up both of those companies.\nNow Dell has gotten into the game, not by acquisition but through a partnership with WLAN vendor Aerohive Networks. On Tuesday, the two companies are introducing a unified management tool called HiveManager NG.\nThe system extends Aerohive’s own management software to oversee Dell’s N Series wired edge switches. With one dashboard for monitoring and configuring both, it basically turns all edge infrastructure into a single network. This simplifies management so much that it can save enterprises time and money, the vendors said.\nThe latest generation of Wi-Fi surpasses desktop Ethernet’s typical speed of 1Gbps (bit per second), making it a central part of enterprise LANs and increasingly the main way users connect.\n“There comes a point when the desktop or mobile user will not need to plug in,” Dell’Oro Group analyst Chris DePuy said.\nThe new version of Wi-Fi, called 802.11ac Wave 2, is also good business for wired network vendors. The faster speed is forcing enterprises to upgrade both their access points and the switches that feed them, using a new form of Ethernet designed just for this purpose. That's bringing wired and wireless companies together, and the Aerohive partnership is a way for Dell to play that game, DePuy said.\nHiveManager NG is a strictly software platform that runs in public or private clouds, so the data and controls can be reached from anywhere. Dell and Aerohive expect some large enterprises to buy the software for in-house deployment, while smaller customers will turn to public clouds. Service and support from Dell, which also will span wired and wireless, can be included in the package.\nUnified management can save enterprises money and time by making it easier to solve network users’ problems on the first call, said David Greene, Aerohive’s senior vice president and chief marketing officer. The HiveManager NG dashboard will let front-line tech support resolve issues more often without having to pass them on to specialists.\nAmong other things, the system performs continuous monitoring of basic conditions like who was on the network when and whether connections were working. If a user reports a problem, that makes it easy to go back and review what was happening. When the system detects a problem, it automatically starts collecting more detailed information for diagnosis, Greene said.\nDell has similar tools for managing all its wireline switches, from the data center out to the edge, but HiveManager streamlines management by adding in wireless. The companies plan to extend the software to Dell’s higher-end C series and lower-end X series switches over the course of this year and into next year.\nJoin the CIO New Zealand group on LinkedIn .

It will become part of IBM Global Business Services.\nOptevia specializes in the public sector market in the UK, where it is based. Its focus is on emergency services, central and local government, health authorities, and housing and social enterprises.\n\"As a part of our ongoing strategy to establish IBM GBS as a premier global digital consultancy and accelerate GBS leadership in the next generation cloud CRM solutions space, Microsoft solution implementations will increasingly require transformational consulting services based on unique client industry insight,\" said Peter Rousseau, an associate partner in IBM Global Business Services' UK public sector practice.\n\"IBM GBS has been successful in this area and needs to continue the expansion of its position with global reach, deep industry expertise and industry-specific assets,\" he told CRM Buyer. \"Optevia's expertise and assets deliver this step change for IBM GBS.\"\nWhere IBM Is Taking Optevia\nIBM has \"a broad portfolio of CRM vendors we partner with and support,\" Rosseau said. \"This will continue.\"\nNotably, it has a strategic alliance with SugarCRM.\nOptevia is a systems integrator, and \"I see this more as IBM increasing its bench in CRM implementation rather than moving away from Sugar,\" noted Rebecca Wettemann, VP of research at Nucleus Research .\nOptevia's strong reputation in the UK public sector will provide immediate access to \"a pool of specialty sales and delivery experts in the rapidly evolving cloud CRM space,\" Rosseau said. It \"will increase the GBS Dynamics practice in Europe.\"\nFurther, the acquisition will provide \"immediate access differentiating code-based assets that are scalable into the broader Europe and North America regions to help drive increased win rates and accelerated time to value for our clients.\"\nThe purchase \"gives IBM more bench strength in implementing CRM, particularly in the public sector,\" Wettemann told CRM Buyer. CRM in government \"is a special case, not just in the way it's implemented -- citizens instead of customers -- but [also] in the way it's purchased.\"\nStretching Could Hurt\nOptevia's focus on the UK public sector makes it likely there will be \"some challenges in expanding that model beyond Europe with different public sector buying cycles,\" Wettemann said, \"but IBM has government clients all over the world that could be targets for Optevia services.\"\nIt may not be a cakewalk for IBM, though, because \"this isn't the old days when [it] could show up and dominate,\" noted Denis Pombriant, principal at Beagle Research. Public sector CRM \"is a crowded market.\"\nHow IBM Can Make It Work\nThat said, there's no need to overhaul Optevia's technology for integration, Pombriant observed.\nThe secret to success will be \"building very specific applications that slide in and work. \"Government can't handle long delays and cost overruns, so IBM needs to throw fastballs over the plate,\" he told CRM Buyer.\nScaling shouldn't be a problem, as Optevia offers a SaaS app, \"unless [IBM does] something dumb like offering single-tenant hosted services,\" Pombriant said. \"That would be more of a facilities management approach, which would crash and burn.\"\nImpact on Microsoft Dynamics\nSugarCRM and Microsoft Dynamics \"are competing solutions with different strengths, so it's not inconceivable that Optevia could become part of [IBM's] SugarCRM implementation plan,\" Nucleus Research's Wettemann surmised.\nIBM GBS is a Microsoft Dynamics CRM partner itself, and \"I wouldn't see this [purchase] necessarily as bad news for Microsoft, but evidence of the increasing competition in the CRM market and IBM's desire to play a growing role in it,\" she added.\nThis is a maturing market, and other companies, like Oracle and Salesforce, have very good solutions, Pombriant pointed out. \"Each of them has a better-built-out suite of in-house and partner-developed platform apps for the public sector, so it's going to be a fight.\"\nRichard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to.

Clayton Associates and Claritas Capital had put only $3.5 million into StudioNow.\nIn addition, AOL confirmed last week’s rumors that CTO Ted Cahall is leaving AOL, and Google/Microsoft alumnus Jeff Raynar has become AOL’s new Head of Technology for Engineering and Products in New York City.\nStockTwits , a sort of Motley Fool 2.0 for sharing investment information, has purchased financial news site Abnormal Returns, and promises to meld the two — plus stock charts startup chart.ly, which StockTwits bought last year — into a real-time financial news hub .

NuConomy, an Israeli-founded firm whose headquarters are — or were — in San Francisco, originally received seed funding from Israeli super-angel Yossi Vardi, followed by $3 million from WPP in early 2008.

Boise, Idaho-based Kount provides online and mobile fraud detection and prevention solutions. Portico Capital Securities LLC provided financial advice to Kount.\nPRESS RELEASE\nBOISE, Idaho & NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Kount Inc. (“Kount”) and CVC Capital Partners (“CVC”) announced today that the CVC Growth Fund will provide an $80 million growth equity investment to Kount, a leading provider of online and mobile fraud detection and prevention solutions. The investment will enable Kount to accelerate product innovation, expand its global footprint, and enhance customer support services.\nBased in Boise, ID, Kount provides cloud-based fraud detection solutions that enable merchants to reduce fraudulent transactions made online and via mobile while increasing revenue by accepting more valid orders. Kount eliminates or reduces manual reviews of potentially fraudulent transactions for its customers, reducing credit card chargebacks, improving customer satisfaction, and drastically reducing fraud, in many cases by more than 90 percent.\nKount works with a number of sectors, including retail, financial services, and gaming, touching billions of transactions and devices every year. Its end-to-end solution is used by thousands of merchants, payment processors, and payment service providers around the world, including Chase Paymentech, PayPal-owned Braintree, New Balance, Spotify and Bodybuilding.com. Kount owns its own proprietary technology and holds dozens of patents in the space.\n“Online merchants face greater fraud challenges than ever before,” said Brad Wiskirchen, CEO, Kount. “CVC’s funding and strategic guidance will provide Kount with significant resources to continue investing in our industry-leading fraud prevention solutions and to deliver the tools our customers need to combat fraud every day. We’re excited to partner with CVC in our next stage of growth as we continue to develop the industry’s most effective and efficient online fraud prevention solution.”\nThe industry is poised for growth as recent reports anticipate that the fraud detection and prevention industry will expand from $9 billion to over $21 billion in 2019. Furthermore, the 2015 Mobile Payments & Fraud Survey found that many organizations are not keeping pace with mobile fraud growth, as over half (60%) of respondents are uncertain if mobile fraud is growing at a faster, slower or equal pace as their overall mobile transaction volume.\n“The payments fraud and security industry is one that we have been actively targeting for a while, and we identified Kount as the obvious industry leader,” said Jason Glass, Managing Director at CVC Growth Partners. “Kount’s long track record of success in a rapidly expanding market will become even more critical to merchants and payment processors as mobile and internet commerce grows.”\n“This investment is perfectly aligned with CVC Growth Partners’ strategy of partnering with uniquely positioned technology companies in large, growing markets,” added John Clark, Managing Partner at CVC Growth Partners. “We are very pleased to work alongside Brad and his team to build on Kount’s success to date.” The investment in Kount is the second made from the CVC Growth Fund, following an investment in Wireless Logic in February 2015.\nPortico Capital Securities LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to Kount with respect to this transaction.\n###\nAbout Kount\nKount helps businesses boost sales by reducing fraud.

While there is debate as to whether the article is accurate and/or overstated, let’s look at how we arrived here:\n1.  Pace of innovation. It is unlike anything we’ve seen before. This is happening because today is a better time to launch a company than ever before : technology, speed, cost, and capital all support the trend. The continued maturation of the internet, the cloud and the emergence of mobile platforms have changed everything involved in building product, targeting users and engaging customers. It has changed the fundamental operating and time constructs behind building compelling businesses.\nAs a result “entrepreneurship is in vogue”, using Fred Wilson’s words .\n2.  Capital. Over the past few years, it has flowed quickly into early stage technology – and it’s come from all directions:\nLike entrepreneurship, angel investing is in vogue. Mark Suster summed it up : “Everyone Now is a F**king Angel. Look at Twitter Bios. Everybody is ‘my day job’ + ‘angel investor.’”\n‘Super angel’ funds have also become more common. These funds can range from $10-50m and they represent a willingness and appetite to make larger investments: $100,000 – $500,000 or more. The fund size allows for larger investments… and the fund economics dictate it.\nMeanwhile, large venture funds are more actively participating in seed deals. These deals vary in size and type: many participate on a convertible note and others are larger investments that lead and price the round. Some firms have dedicated seed investors and/or capital pools.\n3. Cascades. As more money flows into the seed stage, it affects the investments.\nMost obviously: more financings get done.\nLess obviously: the financings look different.\nThere are more early stage investors and those investors want to put more money to work…and invariably the deal economics shift. Entrepreneurs have a desired dilution amount and investors have a desired ownership amount —those move in relative concert. For instance, those rates are the same for a $500,000 round on a $2.5m pre-money valuation as they are for a $1m raise on a $5m pre.\nFurthermore, it affects the deal structure. The majority of today’s seed deals are done on convertible notes—in part because it is often a more efficient way to raise a round and in part because the investor makeup looks different: a slew of great investors perhaps, but no true lead(s). These ‘headless seed’ rounds—without a lead investor to help support and shepherd the raise process alongside the founding team—can make downstream Series A fundraising challenging for those other than the rocket ship startups.\n4. Cash Crunch.  The “cash crunch” for a company comes when it is time to raise the subsequent round.\nThere has been a surge of seed-funded companies, many financed at strong valuations and by a wide network of investors; consequently, the burden is on the company to differentiate itself, show meaningful progress and grow into a subsequent funding in-part influenced by the initial round (capital and valuation).\nGreat companies won’t struggle here, but the reality is that there is a limited number of firms who can write these size checks and a limited number of companies that can support those valuations. Hence the “crunch”.\nSo what does this mean? Some simple advice I’d offer early stage founders:\nStay lean before and after funding. Sounds obvious but early capital infusions should be raised and spent according to plan.\nRaise enough capital for 12-18 months. I meet too many seed companies who optimize against dilution and in turn plan to go to market in 6-9 months. This is frightening because it requires you to demonstrably grow within a very tight timeframe. And you will have to go to market well before the capital dries up.\nOptimize for near term success and long term company value—not for seed valuation. Sure, it sounds self-serving coming from an investor… But it’s true. Craft your seed round such that it puts you in the best position to grow, deliver on your vision, and raise a strong Series A.\nOne of those factors is people. Be thoughtful about your investors. Think about the value each investor brings and what the larger investor makeup looks like. Can the group help you achieve those non-financial milestones? And if needed, can the group guide and help you if you feel “crunched”.\nTwo questions I always ask seed companies:\n“What will success look like at the end of the seed phase?”\n“When do you know it’s time to raise your A round?”\nIf you have a great handle on those questions, the rest will fall into place.\nImage credit: Shutterstock/  Lasse Kristensen\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Zude , a startup based in Roslyn, N.Y., thinks the answer lies with customization, and as such is offering a platform that is part social, with a community of member pages, but also part web mashup, with a drag-and-drop design application that lets users drag content from (almost) any web site directly onto their Zude pages.\nOwned by Fifth Generation Systems (5g) , Zude had raised $5 million in VC funding when it rolled out its private beta last May — only to find it was unable to handle the site traffic. So the company regrouped, beefed up its capabilities, and launched a public beta, to little fanfare, in July.\nAdvertisement\nThe pre-designed templates on which users can build their pages resemble a typical MySpace profile, with features including a guestbook and profile information. Also like MySpace, Zude is trying to tap into cool by encouraging musicians to add profiles and music to the site. It also plans to eventually add a classified directory, according to CEO Jim McNeil.\nAdvertisement\nAt its core, however, the company is trying to make it easy for users to design their own, fully customizable web sites and profile pages that are a mashup of found and created content, sort of like a free-for-all NetVibes .\nAdvertisement\nDo they accomplish this goal? Well, sort of. The interface is fairly painful to navigate at first, at least in Firefox (it’s supposedly better in Internet Explorer; it didn’t work at all in Safari), but with the end goal of putting together a custom webpage, it’s still easier to figure out than Dreamweaver.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s also easy to make a really ugly, graphic-heavy web site, replete with clashing colors. As we learned from MySpace, self-expression isn’t always pretty.\nAdvertisement\nWhat really sets Zude apart from similar startups like ZCubes , PageFlakes , NetVibes and others is that it lets users actually drag content in from other windows and plop it right down on their page. Similar to competitor ZCubes , you can take an image from Google image search in one window, and click and drag it onto the page, easy as…potential copyright infringement? We’ll leave it to Zude’s lawyers to deal with that problem.\nAdvertisement\nLike ZCubes, Zude lets users create a mashup of Internet sites. For instance, check out this Zude page that includes GigaOM , Earth2Tech , and NewTeeVee that I spent about 30 minutes creating — 25 of which were spent trying to get the application to work properly in my browser.\nAdvertisement\nDon’t bother trying to put a Facebook profile on the page, though. McNiel explains that Facebook is among the list of sites that block the ability to plop their content into a mash-up page on Zude; The New York Times is another one. Instead, users are limited to posting links.\nAdvertisement\nIt turns out it’s not too difficult for companies to block Zude from being able to go in and, uh, borrow content from their pages. Sites might want to block Zude because it’s not exactly kosher to run ads on someone else’s content. But some sites might like the added traffic. The copied web sites load in full inside the Zude pages, with advertising intact. It’s unclear how many sites will block Zude, and if that will affect their growth potential.\nAdvertisement\nThe biggest problem with Zude at the moment is its interface. Even a well-designed page gets cluttered with an annoying and ugly navigational bar at the top of the screen, and the banner ad that pops up in the bottom of the screen for the first 30 seconds after the window loads doesn’t help, either. The company plans to offer paid accounts that will get rid of that advertising altogether.\nAdvertisement\nIf Zude can clean up its UI a bit, it could catch on.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

The world order is very far still from my 2007 vision: Web 3.0 = (4C + P + VS) . Nonetheless, read on to learn about some very interesting developments in the industry.\nSramana Mitra: Let’s start by introducing our audience to yourself as well as to Zmags.\nBrian Rigney: I’m the CEO of Zmags. I joined Zmags just about two years ago. My background before that has been a series of startups including companies like CashStar that does digital commerce through gift cards and other applications.\nSramana Mitra: That’s a Maine company right?\nBrian Rigney: That is a Maine company, yes. You can find them at CashStar.com.\nSramana Mitra: We’ve done their story. I know Dave.\nBrian Rigney: He asked me to join as a co-founder. I consulted before he raised any money. Then I joined formally as the eighth employee, and helped to grow its customers from just Home Depot and a few others to over 250 retailers and banks including J.P. Morgan, Walmart, GAP and many others. I have also helped advise a series of companies both publicly and privately held to help them into new spaces and new markets. These include companies like WEX, which is a fleet fueling card.\nThen I also was the Founder and CEO of a company called BlueTarp Financial, which is one of the first digital commerce companies that I started back in 1999 and ran for the next six and a half years. Think of them as a commerce payments technology platform. They’re both the issuer of the BlueTarp accounts and the acquirer of merchants. They service both the merchant and the cardholder.\nSramana Mitra: What is Zmags?\nBrian Rigney: Zmags is a privately held company owned by the Gores Group, which is a private equity fund based out of California. Zmags is a SaaS-based company that offers two products. The first is called Publicator that allows someone to upload a PDF and convert that into a richer, more engaging, online experience. It includes commerce. Our newest product is called Creator. That’s what we’re most excited about. Creator is a SaaS-based patform as well that allows e-commerce marketers to create rich, engaging content, and then deploy that to their website without any coding.\nToday, you can start off wanting to create a new experience for your website. You could create it the next 30 minutes. Five minutes after that, it could go live with animation and multiple images. It doesn’t require anyone to do any coding. Zmags’ classic entrepreneur story started in Copenhagen in 2006 as someone’s idea during college. He wanted to raise some venture capital and expand to the North American market. He opened up a headquarters office here in Boston in the 2008 to 2009 time frame. He raised some venture money.\nA new vision came into play. That vision was bold. They tried to execute against that over the next three years. Ultimately, it was too bold. They had some early buy-ins and success with signing on customers but the challenges and the technology limitations at that time did not make it possible to achieve their vision. In early 2013, the company was put up for sale. In December 2013, the Gores Group came in to take a look at it. The company was acquired formally in January of 2014.\n", "deleted" : false }

His photoblog was basically ignored for the first year, but then it took off. Now, Humans of New York is massively popular , and Stanton has parlayed his success into two book deals.\n2. Jim Koch\nA Harvard Business School graduate and consultant with Boston Consulting Company, Koch took the Austrian beer recipe that had been in his family for generations and used it to launch Samuel Adams (Boston Beer Company). With Budweiser, Coors, and Miller now owned by foreign companies, Boston Beer Company is now the largest American brewery.\n3. Al \"Bubba\" Baker\nBaker, a Pro Bowl defensive end in the NFL, always loved food--especially barbecue--and told me in an interview that he was \"always cooking\" on his days off. After retirement, he launched a successful barbecue restaurant, and patented a way to debone spare ribs. He then convinced investor Daymond John to invest in his company in an episode of Shark Tank .\n4. Chris Michel\nA former Naval Flight Officer, Michel attended Harvard Business School and then launched Military.com, one of the first social networks in America, and Affinity Labs, both of which he ultimately sold to Monster Worldwide. (I wrote about Michel in my 2010 book, The Intelligent Entrepreneur .)\n5. Jennifer Hyman and Jennifer Fleiss\nBusiness school classmates Hyman and Fleiss turned their passion for fashion into Rent the Runway, which now has five brick-and-mortar stores and offers over 50,000 designer dresses for rent.\n6. Yvon Chouinard\nAn avid climber, Chouinard bought a second-hand forge and began to make his own equipment. Ultimately he founded Patagonia, a manufacturer of high-end outdoor clothing that did $600 million in sales in 2013.\n7. Debbi Fields\nFields was only 20 years old when she started selling homemade chocolate cookies--a tiny business that she and her husband, Rands Fields, ultimately grew into Mrs. Fields, which now has and 390 locations around the United States and 4,000 employees.\n8. Wendy Kopp\nKopp turned her senior thesis at Princeton University into Teach for America, a $229-million-a-year nonprofit organization that places graduates from some of America's top colleges and universities as teachers in challenged public schools.\n9. Bill Gates\nRight, he created Microsoft. Long before that, however, he was an amateur programmer who was passionate enough about computers that in the eighth grade, he managed to get excused from math class to design things like early video games.\n10. Kevin Plank\nA football player at the University of Maryland, Plank designed shirts that could wick away sweat , and convinced his former teammates who went on to play professionally to try his product and share it with their teammates. The company that resulted, Under Armour, had $2.3 billion in revenue in 2013.\n11. Walt Disney\nWhat did Disney spend his time doing while growing up? Well, working--but also drawing, from an early age. He was pretty young when he sold his first drawing (of a neighbor's horse). Disney launched several unsuccessful animation companies before coming up with Mickey Mouse in 1928.\nLike this column?

So far in November, online sales are 4 percent less than last year. Online retailers Amazon and eBay will be fighting for every last Christmas dollar.\nThe two look more and more alike these days, as eBay seeks growth beyond the mom-and-pop auction sellers that everyone associates with the site. The company has been emphasizing fixed-price listings for a while now. But earlier this week it took another step towards wooing the types of merchants that you are still more likely to find on Amazon. On Monday, eBay quietly announced a new program in beta that will allow large merchants to list thousands of fixed-price items at once on the site.\nThis will no doubt give eBay’s core mom-and-pop auction sellers one more thing to complain about (like they need more competition from larger outfits). But what else can eBay do? Its main source of growth comes from its non-retail businesses like Skype. Its $945 million Bill Me Later acquisition is now looking suspect . And its overall ability to attract consumers has stagnated. According to comScore, eBay had 70.7 million unique U.S. visitors in October, down 11 percent from the year before. In contrast, Amazon had 60.1 million unique U.S. visitors in October, up 6 percent (see chart above).\nThe reality is that any merchant selling online will list their items for sale in multiple locations—on Amazon, eBay, their own Websites, etc. (Multi-channel e-commerce management service Mercent, for example, is already supporting eBay’s API for its online retail customers).\nNow, with this new API we might see some interesting mixing and matching. An online retailer, for instance, can now list her items on eBay and use Amazon’s fulfillment API to ship the orders from an Amazon warehouse.\nDon’t underestimate the importance of these APIs in the battle to dominate e-commerce. Whoever controls the flow of transaction information, will control the flow of goods online.\n", "deleted" : false }

The problem is, of course, that visits to the doctor’s office cost money. Plus, you need an appointment and you’ll probably sit in a waiting room. Wellsphere’s Ron Gutman founded HealthTap in 2010 to give anyone and everyone the opportunity to consult with human doctors in realtime, for free.\nBut the real, big picture goal, the HealthTap founder says, is to become the go-to resource for reliable health information — a mission that has led to the development of a searchable doctor directory (complete with ratings, peer-reviews and direct booking) alongside its HIPAA-secure Q&A offering. With plenty of cash in the bank , HealthTap has been looking for ways to expand its knowledge network and is doing so today by making its first acquisition.\nHealthTap announced this morning that it has acquired Avvo Health in an all-cash deal. While the specific terms of the deal weren’t revealed, Avvo will be turning over all assets of its health business to they buyer and will be shutting down its health vertical beginning today.\nFor those unfamiliar, Avvo is a Benchmark-backed Q&A portal and ranking service that initially focused exclusively on lawyers. In 2010, it expanded to include doctors , offering a ratings directory for 90 percent of the doctors in the U.S. along with profiles that include information on their education, residencies, board certification, etc.\nLike HealthTap, Avvo’s Health service also included a Q&A service in which users can ask anonymous questions of its network of physicians, as well as a library of health guides covering a host of topics.\nBut more recently, Avvo has been looking to get back to its core competency and move out of the health business altogether, making it an attractive acquisition candidate. By scooping up Avvo Health, HealthTap has expanded its Medical Expert Network to more than 30K licensed U.S. doctors and dentists, broadening local coverage to all 50 states in 128 specialties — along with hundreds of additional group practices and hospitals.\nThe acquisition is a win for both companies, giving Avvo some extra cash with which to continue growing its legal business, in turn allowing a company that’s on the rise (and actually focuses on health) to quickly add depth to its information network. Plus, HealthTap’s dentist directory has been pretty bare-bones up to this point, making Avvo’s comparative strength in this area particularly appealing.\nAs a result of the acquisition, HealthTap now counts 1.2 million doctors and dentists in its network, making it one of the largest mobile physician directories and Q&A portals on the Web. The startup has raised $14 million in venture capital to date from Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, Mohr Davidow, Mayfield Fund, Esther Dyson and Aaron Patzer.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

And one of the things I’m finding there is giving me cause for alarm.\nDriven by \"Not Enough\"\nOne of the primary drivers of the frenetic striving and Herculean accomplishments of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs is a deep sense of not being good enough. Not smart enough, not brave enough, not creative enough. Somehow, in some way, not enough. This sense of lack, and the compulsion to anesthetize it through achievement, combined with the right combination of smarts, guts, and ecosystem are creating a boom in the startup world. Billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs are being created. And that’s a great thing.\nBut the dark underbelly of this startup boom is that too often companies are getting built in a way that leaves founders and team members drained, exhausted, and ultimately, unfulfilled. It’s the result of building a company because you think you have something to prove. It leads to a near constant state of anxiety and fear of failure with fleeting moments of celebration. And it doesn’t have to be that way.\nWired for Fear\nHuman brains are predominately wired for fear. It makes sense evolutionarily that in a world of lions, tigers, and bears, those with the most sensitivity to danger would have the best chance to survive and reproduce. The mental constructs \"I’m not enough\" and \"I don’t have enough\" are brilliant survival programs for creating a near constant state of vigilance and drive to succeed.\nBut we no longer live in that world. We have conquered all of our natural predators and civilized our society at such a rate that our brains are fairly outmoded for our modern world. So too, is the way we operate as creators and builders of businesses.\nDriven by Love\nAs society’s innovators, entrepreneurs have a great opportunity to pave the way for a new way of conducting themselves and their businesses—shifting from a context of \"not enough,\" fear, and lack to one of sufficiency, love, and inspiration. The pioneers are among us.\nWhen you conjure up an image of Sir Richard Branson , what most likely comes to mind is a man who loves his life. You picture him grinning ear to ear, laughing heartily, and warmly shaking someone’s hand or giving them a hug. He’s a man who savors life, and whose entrepreneurial endeavors themselves appear to be acts of love and creative expression. Herb Kelleher, founder and chairman of Southwest Airlines , is another entrepreneur who clearly built a company from a place of love and service. Southwest is renowned for their extraordinary culture, and the caring they show for each member of their team and their customers. Their ticker symbol is LUV. Their examples serve as a shining counter-example to the norm among entrepreneurs.\nMoving Beyond Fear\nWhen I challenge my clients to believe they are enough just as they are, they often reply that they’re afraid to lose their drive to succeed. They worry that if they felt the sense of peace and appreciation that comes with believing who you are is enough than they would become couch potatoes (or worse, failed entrepreneurs). What they initially fail to realize is that there is another, more powerful source of motivation: love. When you imagine contributing to another person, or a group of people, in a meaningful way you can’t help but feel a stirring in your heart and an energy in your core that pulls you into action. And from this inspired place, your level of focus, creativity, and energy is far greater than when you’re driven by fear and lack.\nWhen you experience your work as contribution to others, you handle setbacks and obstacles in stride instead of seeing every bump in the road as a potential to expose you as the fraud you believe you are. When you operate from love, you’re at your most creative, imagining the future you want to create rather than resisting the present you’re currently in. You focus on how much value you’re delivering, not just how much you’re capturing.\nSo, you ask, how do I shift from operating from a place of fear and lack to one of love and inspiration? One moment at a time.\nExtend Your Breathing\nI once had a meditation teacher tell me that you can change your entire experience of life if you extend your exhale by one second. Just one second. The breath serves as both an indicator and a signal for our nervous system that we’re in danger. When you slow down your breath, you send a signal to your nervous system that everything is okay, and free up your mind for creative activities.\nFocus on Your Contribution\nNotice the all-too-common tendency to judge and evaluate your own performance. \"Why did I say that?\" \"That email was way too long.\" \"Why didn’t I ask for the deal?\" We spend a good portion of our mental lives criticizing ourselves for falling short of the ideal we hold ourselves to. One great way to instantly transcend this inner conversation is to focus on the contribution you’re making in others’ lives. Imagine the person or people you’re impacting, and what their life was like before you or your company touched their lives. Now create a clear picture of what their life has been like since, and notice the positive difference that you created. Typically, you’ll begin to feel inspired to create more of the same.\nImagine the Future You Want\nOne of the most pernicious traps we fall into as entrepreneurs is shifting our focus from the inspiring future we want to the frustrating reality that we’re not there yet. We essentially collapse the imagined future into the present, and wish things were different than they are right now. When you resist reality, reality wins every time. Instead, put the future rightfully where it belongs, in the future. Rather than begrudging how far you have to go or wishing you were already there, simply imagine the future you want, enjoy the inspiration and excitement that comes, and take the next practical step forward.\nFor startups, the culture of the company is largely forged by the inner experience of the founders. Entrepreneurs, it’s time to elevate your inner game for the sake of the people who will be impacted by you and the companies you build. When you choose to believe that you are good enough, and experience the lightness, joy, and love that naturally occurs from that place, you will build an extraordinary company that not only makes you rich, but also enriches people's lives.\n—Dave Kashen serves as founder and leadership coach/trainer at San Francisco-based Unleashed , a premier leadership & culture development firm for startups.

Esco, real name William Moore, is the DJ for one of rap music’s biggest names, Future. Ultimately, DJ Esco spent 56 nights in jail, returning to the U.S. in January 2015.\nWhen he got back, Esco  gave a definitive interview to the Fader , a small, prestige music publication known primarily for two things: In-depth profiles of A-list musicians, and Fader Fort, probably the most high-profile party of SXSW Music.\n“Fader told my story better than I could ever tell my story,” he told a crowd at SXSW a few weeks ago.\nThis is the reputation of the Fader. A Fader cover has become coveted real estate in the music industry, and unlike Rolling Stone covers of yore, Fader photos are often set up as viral grist for a musician’s Instagram followers.\nIts cover feature stories run the gamut from hip-hop and pop stars like Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna to country music rising stars, like Kacey Musgraves. The magazine was founded in 1999 by ex-label promoters Jon Cohen and Rob Stone, and it is owned by their ad agency, Cornerstone.\nFader’s audience is small, but growing; it has an average print circulation of 115,000, and Quantcast says it had around two million global unique visitors this month. Traffic has increased around 40 percent across Web and mobile in the last year, and its video views have gone up by 400 percent, according to the magazine.\nNaomi Zeichner, Fader’s editor in chief, is the person responsible for directing editorial strategy, picking who gets on covers and tying it all to Fader’s events business. She was named one of Forbes’ 2016 30 under 30, and she has spent most of her career working for Fader. After a yearlong stint at BuzzFeed, she returned to run Fader in early 2015.\nI caught up with Zeichner at SXSW to talk about her interests, SXSW and managing a small print publication in a media environment that is more and more unforgiving for such efforts. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nNoah Kulwin: Musicians can now tap into their audiences directly through services like Snapchat or Instagram, and they don’t need to go through a middleman in the media like they used to. Approaching an artist, when they have less and less incentive to talk to a magazine like the Fader, what makes them want to do so?\nEvery cover story we do has its own quirks. But across the board, we approach them with the same core principles that the Fader started with in 1999. We ask for a lot of access, during someone’s down time. We do intimate photo shoots that don’t involve huge budgets or lots of styling. We don’t give photo or story approval. And absolutely, we’ve seen artists get increasingly anxious about all of that. But ultimately, we have a real audience that respects us, and artists know and respect that. We follow our gut over release schedules or sales numbers or what publicists want to happen. And we make our magazine to live beyond its issue cycle. To have a Fader cover is to join an elite squad of people who actually mean something to our readers and to culture, and — in a lot of cases — have gone on to have real staying power in music.\nPeople like Chance the Rapper or J. Cole or Kehlani are really good storytellers. That’s how they’ve built such strong fan bases. And I don’t think the stories those artists tell are necessarily inauthentic. But I do believe that two perspectives are better than one.\n \nFader EIC Naomi Zeichner\nAlex Welsh / Fader\nIs there a clear digital-print division at the Fader like there is at other print publications?\nNo. And that was part of the selling point, even when I was an intern. I sat in a room with editors, and there was exposure to the everyday print magazine process. And as we grow, a huge part of Fader’s DNA still is that everybody should get to touch everything. And that we all should know how to make the product that we’re making. And that’s part of the reason I hope that it’s more valuable to work at Fader than somewhere else.\nAfter a while, I moved up a couple title changes, and I left and went to BuzzFeed, where I edited the music vertical. I had a really positive experience there, and I think if anything, learned a ton about analytics and what different music audiences were interested in.\nCould you talk a little bit about the lessons learned at BuzzFeed before you came back to the Fader at the end of 2014?\nSomething that [BuzzFeed Editor in Chief] Ben Smith is obsessed with is scoops, and I think that I came back with a real fire under my ass to make sure that Fader was known for its news and its reporting as well as its tastemaking. I wanted to really form our news operation, and Fader didn’t really have a news arm. But it’s been really important to have aggregation like other sites, as well as original reporting.\nA big takeaway for me at BuzzFeed was focusing more than ever on what you might call pop music and focusing on fandoms more than tastemakers. I think BuzzFeed has such a populist approach to a lot of things, and that was my approach at BuzzFeed Music. I think what I learned there is that pop music comes in a million different forms.\nHow did you get involved with the Fader?\nI grew up in Athens, Georgia. I went to school at a college out in Oregon called Reed College. I studied art. I sort of aspired to be an art teacher or an arts educator. I moved to New York to do some of that work and in that time started interning at the Fader. I was sort of a lifelong music fan, college radio DJ or whatever, just really was a huge Fader fan as a kid.\nShortly after interning, I started to realize that I was really liking the work a lot. After interning, I believe I first started as an online editor and started blogging. I came in around 2010, and left four years later.\nSo how small was your staff then?\nThese are fuzzy numbers, but like around six. There were a couple of video people, an events team, a marketing team, but absolutely on the edit side it was a smaller crew. We had one edit meeting a week and we all fit in a small room, and now we don’t. At the time we had this one office, and now we have like four.\nI was very focused on the Internet. I don’t know if that’s exactly why they hired me. I wasn’t doing a ton for the magazine, and was initially just writing for the website every day.\nThe Fader has a pretty small staff. On the Internet now, there’s an an incentive for publications to scale incredibly fast to a large digital audience because that’s the only way they can sustain themselves. Is scale something that you’re chasing, or do you want to keep Fader at a certain size?\nWe don’t feel precious about keeping our audience small. We want to be a definitive music magazine that gets as big as possible, but I think a right way to do that is to keep the trust that people have in us, so that we can do really big impactful stories and that people know that our shit is always dank. That’s the way to grow, that is scale to me.\nIt’s not just that we’re housed within Cornerstone — we have founders who believe in us and have reinvested resources in Fader in the last couple of years.\nThe crowd at Fader Fort 2016 in Austin\nRyan Muir / Fader\nAnd you’ve been adding more and more staff with those resources, right? What has your hiring looked like over the last year and a half?\nThe biggest story in our hiring is that we totally revamped our video operation. I see what we’ve been doing in video as a Phase One, which is really doing what we do in the magazine — long-form, in-depth profiles of artists. The next push is continuing with our long-form video and thinking about what does short-form, Internet-friendly video look like for the Fader.\nYou’ve said that you don’t want to play the aggregation game, and that you’re investing in original, deep reporting, and hiring original writers is a core part of your strategy. Simultaneously, I don’t know of a single place that’s been able to sustain that and really scale it without support from an existing revenue model. How are you working with the business side to make that possible?\nI can’t speak to overall business strategy; it’s not what I do. A huge thing for us is internationalization. We’ve opened an office in London, and we have a new office in Toronto. If we think about scale — more posts, more coverage — that’s sort of happening organically. We have people on the ground to do more aggregation, more reporting, more premieres and to touch base in those communities.\nBut listen, our strategy isn’t just because we think that it’s the right way to do things, it’s because the numbers support it. When we have a story that other people don’t have, that’s what makes people read us.\nMedia companies are increasingly crowding into the events space, like my employer, for example. You’ve been at SXSW for 15 years now. How do you stay competitive?\nWe were on the early side of any brands or publications coming down here. We’ve stayed and really committed to doing this, and it’s not like year-to-year we wait to see if somebody has some money and “Oh, then we’ll do an event.” This is a core part of our DNA.\nhttps://twitter.com/thefader/status/711403342333739008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\nrecode_divider\nMore From Recode\n", "deleted" : false }

By connecting your inbox to the web, you get business-critical information about key people and companies. See how it works here .\nOver the past two years, real estate professionals have found creative ways to overcome the real estate crisis , including finding innovative uses for social media. After facing drops in home sales well into 2010 , real estate pros have been forced to utilize their offline skills in an increasingly social way online. By using photo and video sharing to enhance listings, along with professional networking sites to hone their sales skills, real estate veterans have made strides in moving inventory in tough times.\nAgents, brokers and realtors have found successes in lead generation, sales and brand building through use of mass audience social platforms, including Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , Flickr , Meetup , and LinkedIn , as well as real estate specific platforms, like Trulia , Zillow , WellcomeMat and Architizer .\nWhether they are sharing videos, listings or advice with their communities and prospective buyers or sellers, real estate pros are making progress in using social media for real results.\nAttracting Buyers and Sellers\nThe core goal of real estate pros utilizing social media is to attract sellers looking to list their homes or buyers looking to purchase homes. Naturally, the 1.0 version of social media for real estate is setting up pages on social networks that fit your company's content and audience.\nCorcoran Group , the largest residential real estate firm in New York City, is a fitting example of how real estate agencies are going above and beyond to make themselves available for buyers and sellers. Corcoran differentiates itself by simply being available and open. The \"Do More\" tab on their Facebook page says it all — you can find them on Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , Foursquare , and Gowalla , among other sites. And if you need more, you can download their iPhone app , where you can find nearby homes for sale or rent and open houses. The app also promotes their Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages. If you dig a little deeper, you can also find Corcoran on Tumblr , Blip.tv and Vimeo . Simply put, Corcoran has found a way to be everywhere for its clients. This is the first step to converting fans and followers into buyers and sellers.\nMatthew Shadbolt, Director of Internet Marketing at The Corcoran Group, filled me in on Corcoran's social media strategy. As a lifestyle brand, Corcoran doesn't simply create a presence, they participate in it. For example, the Corcoran YouTube channel features CEO Pam Liebman answering questions posed by Facebook and Twitter followers regarding the state of the housing market and New York living tips. Furthermore, Shadbolt proactively leaves local neighborhood tips on Foursquare and Gowalla for users to find. He notes,\n\"We have created and implemented a comprehensive mobile marketing strategy of leaving tips around New York based on the huge wealth of local neighborhood knowledge which we specialize in at Corcoran. Our brand premise of communicating what it's like to actually live in a neighborhood and what living in NYC is like 'beyond the four walls of your apartment' is a key driver behind this approach.\"\nShadbolt went on to explain that revenue from social media had been substantial:\n\"The main thing we've seen is that the quality of the referral traffic back into our main website has significantly increased. Not only are we seeing more traffic coming in, but visitors coming in from social media sites are staying longer and looking at more things — something we had also seen with search engines but not in such large numbers. We have generated business through both Facebook and Twitter, primarily on the rentals side. People engaging with us directly on Facebook in particular has been increasing significantly over the past two months.\"\nAnother company that seems to be doing well with attracting customers is ApartmentHomeLiving.com , an apartment lifestyle guide and apartment finder. Their Facebook page is full of requests for apartments, which they promptly respond to with listings and ideas. They even have an admirable YouTube presence, with 1,600 videos, totaling over 113,000 views in the past year.\nSharing Listings, Tours, and Showings\nIn the real estate world, listings, open houses and tours are the main stepping stones towards making a sale, and the digital world has made those steps much easier.\nCorcoran, for example, recently created a Twitter account , strictly for new listings, to accommodate demand. Meanwhile, the main Corcoran Twitter account stays fresh with local and industry news.\nWellcomeMat, the largest community of real estate professionals, brokerages and filmmakers using full-motion real estate video tours to market themselves and properties, has made producing and sharing video property tours easier, as well. With a community of 18,000 real estate professionals, WellcomeMat serves real estate agencies, brokerages and firms of all sizes, and also partners with and powers video for some of the nations top real estate brokerages including Halstead, Weichert and Prudential Douglas Elliman.\nThe service offers over 3,000 local production teams for those who don't have videographers on staff, and also allows for easy integration with your website and YouTube channel. Users can also take advantage of automated link distribution into Facebook, Twitter and Craigslist, and the advanced reporting tools offered.\nPhil Thomas Di Giulio, Co-Founder of WellcomeMat, explained in depth how real estate pros are using the full-service video platform to make an impact on their bottom lines:\n\"The majority of the videos being uploaded to WellcomeMat involve property tours, neighborhood profiles, brokerage information and updates, or agency advertisements. The common identifier with each of the videos is their ability to engage and capture the imagination of the viewer online while delivering quality information about a property, place, person or town.\n\"Video enables agents and brokerages to share this local knowledge and connect with consumers in a whole new way. This is very important because consumers are more likely to work with an agent [or brokerage] who displays superior knowledge about the local area which they represent.\"\nAfter generating a lead, there are many options for scheduling, but one of the newest and easiest-to-use services is Tungle.me , a service that promises to mitigate \"double bookings, time zone mishaps, or email ping pong.\"\nDrew Burks , 2008 San Diego Real Estate Broker of the Year, uses Tungle.me to schedule company meetings with his agents, new Realtor recruitment meetings, and to schedule showings on his listings. Burks elaborated on how his brokerage is continuing to experiment with the service:\n\"I believe [Tungle.me] will increase our agent showings, because there won't be the missed calls and confusion over showing times, especially when the seller doesn't allow us to use a lockbox on their property [where a spare key may be stored]. This technology is proving to be much more effective than scheduling appointments and showings via the telephone.\"\nLending Expert Advice\nWhile an occasional listing may be appreciated by your social media community, many experts advocate engaging your audience with industry knowledge and an expert perspective, rather than alienating users with useless information. Because there are so many factors that must align to make a listing pertinent to a single customer, such as pricing, location and size, there is a high probability that most listings do not pertain to most people in a given social media audience.\nJames Kimmons, real estate business expert on About.com, advises real estate pros to refrain from overwhelming their followers and connections with real estate listings. He advises ,\n\"Promote you, your business, and your expertise in your local area real estate market. Do it with market commentary, education and statistics. Link out to your IDX search page, because a lot of your visitors will want to look at listings at some point, just not your listing du jour.\"\nThere are many sites with specialized sections for real estate professionals to lend their expertise, such as Trulia Voices and Zillow Advice . Both sites are frequented by prospective home buyers, on the search for answer about topics ranging from pricing and relocating to financing and closing. A typical question on either site will yield quite a few answers from agents or brokers specializing in a specific geographic region or area of real estate. This type of interaction with folks on the market is a great way to build a credible reputation and build brand recognition for future consideration.\nYouTube also presents a valid platform for sharing real estate tips. For example, Keller Williams Realty International , a real estate franchise company, maintains a YouTube channel full of videos on monthly real estate reports, real estate advice and current company events. Keller Williams boasts nearly 400,000 video views, 100,000 channel views and 2,000 subscribers. Those are numbers worth celebrating.\nIf you are a real estate professional, keep an eye out ways you to showcase your expertise and local knowledge. You should start to see an increase in interaction, as you provide useful, relevant information to others.\nConnecting with Other Real Estate Professionals\nIn order to improve upon their skills and network in the industry, real estate professionals are using social networks specific to their industry. Some of these networks include ActiveRain and The Flipping Pad .\nAlthough it is in beta testing, Architizer is the largest crowd-sourced database of architecture online, with over 10,000 finished and proposed projects posted from fans, owners and architects that are easily searchable. The site provides a networking space for real estate developers and architects, where developers can search for architects and architects can upload their projects. This type of social network is allowing developers to get a better grasp of the talent options on the market, while also giving architects a better chance at being discovered.\nCEO and Co-Founder Marc Kushner, also an architect, explains that, \"The old model revolved around magazines, in which architects had to make it into certain issues. So, say that that a developer picks up the November issue of a certain architecture magazine. The only way that the architect would have the chance of being discovered by the developer was if he happened to be in that November issue.\" Architizer simplifies the connecting process by bringing architects and developers together in one place.\nMore well-known social networks, including Meetup, Flickr and LinkedIn are provided spaces for real estates pros to connect and learn from one another. Some examples of active Meetup groups include Chicago Real Estate Group and New Jersey Real Estate Social Network . Both Meetups are ranked highly and have received favorable feedback from attendees. For example, Loan Officer Lorna Roberts , said that the New Jersey Real Estate Social Network Meetup, is an \"excellent way to network and learn more about what is affecting the community and businesses.\" For more information on how to get a real estate Meetup started in your community, check out our tips on organizing a successful Meetup .\nOther group settings on social networks, such as the National Association of REALTORS on LinkedIn , or the Photography for Real Estate group on Flickr , are great places to connect with specialized professionals in the real estate industry.\nFrom connecting with buyers and sellers to networking with industry peers and lending expert advice, there are many ways to utilize social media as a real estate professional.

Our source says that neither is a media company but could be a large consumer electronics company or a big internet brand.\nHere is the relevent part from the 8-K:\n“Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including, among others, (i) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (ii) all consents, approvals, permits and authorizations having been obtained, and (iii) Viggle receiving gross proceeds from a convertible debt financing equal to or greater than $60 million.  Viggle has received indications of interest and commitments from various strategic investors with respect to its convertible debt financing.  In addition, Viggle’s and AdaptiveBlue’s respective obligations to consummate the Merger are subject to certain other conditions, including, among others, (i) subject to the standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) compliance of the other party with its covenants in all material respects, (iii) no event, change, effect or circumstance occurring that would constitute a material adverse effect on the other party.”\nViggle is now a public company, and in its time, the company has raised $67 million, with the chairman/CEO Robert Sillerman funding half of that himself, and  Adage Capital and Baron Funds  among other big shareholders.\nThis $60 million, however, would be the first time that the company picked up strategic investors. Who they are is still unknown, but we’ve seen a number of consumer electronics companies, such as Samsung, making investments in and putting big bets on connected TV, and the services running on connected TV, in order to sweeten the device deal, and also to do better battle against the likes of Apple.\nSimilarly, companies like Google have also been upping their game in TV, and its newest division, Motorola, has also had an extensive history making strategic investments into businesses that closely align with its own products. Connected TV is one of those.\nViggle’s 8-K form also details the break fee if the acquisition of GetGlue does not go ahead: it’s on the small side, $500,000.\nLeading up to this acquisition, our source noted that there wasn’t any kind of bidding war on GetGlue, which has picked up 3 million users to date, but it was still something that was probably inevitable as the industry continues to mature and look for critical mass in interactive and second-screen TV services.\n“Both parties see benefits of this deal,” our source said. “And where else were they going to go? Together, they have roughly 80-85% of the second screen TV base. The market is not big enough for them to try different tacks yet. Coming together brings the concept to the forefront, to advertisers and media partners, and jumpstarts the industry. It makes a lot of sense.”\nThe $60 million financing, we understand, is due to close in the next 30 days.\n", "deleted" : false }

Mobile video ad spend in the U.S. more than doubled from 2013 ($720 million) to 2014 ($1.5 billion) and will reach $6 billion in 2018, representing about half of the total online video ad spend.\nThe growth in mobile devices, broadband coverage and 4G services, device screen size and video consumption on mobile devices are the first obvious drivers. Other, less obvious drivers relate to the way users consume video on mobile. More and more of users’ time on mobile is spent in applications (86 percent of users’ time in mobile in 2014).\nSince in-app video inventory is usually more engaging and can be coupled with more data, it is usually valued higher than mobile web video inventory. More users are watching video on tablets than on smartphones , which is another contributor to the bottom line since we are seeing that tablet video ad inventory is usually 30-50 percent more expensive than smartphone video inventory.\nAnother interesting driver is the democratization of video production and distribution. Some of the most beautiful, professionally produced videos I have seen lately were created with smartphone video cameras. Talented individuals are creating niche category mobile video hubs, “unbundling” YouTube and other large, more general video hubs. Mobile sharing is easy and intuitive and has immediate, powerful distribution potential across multiple, viral channels.\nThis significantly increases the rate of growth of video “inventory” – potential ad slots for the more expensive video ad units – pre/mid/post-rolls. I say “potential” because most user-generated content is not ripe for ad monetization. Video ads are usually a brand awareness play and the big brands behind the ads prefer to have their brand associated with premium content.\nThe democratization trend does produce a lot more cat-walking-on-piano videos, but it also generates more professionally produced video content, at scale, contributing more inventory that is relevant for pre/mid/post-roll demand.\nMulti-channel networks such as Maker Studios (acquired by Disney) and Fullscreen also assist in the production and distribution of quality video content for brands. As these entities seek to branch out of YouTube, they also look to significantly increase their mobile footprint. Competing new environments, like the up-and-coming Vessel platform, are built primarily for smartphones and tablets. In time, these tectonic shifts will translate into a spiked surge in mobile video inventory.\nLarge, classic publishers such as Yahoo and AOL also understand the potential of video and are investing significantly in producing, partnering and syndicating video content ( Yahoo’s Brightroll acquisition and various video content partnerships) and building video infrastructure ( AOL’s acquisition of Adap.TV , Facebook’ acquisition of LiveRail and RTL’s investment in SpotXchange). They also understand that users’ attention is shifting to mobile, especially to applications. However, while their traffic shifts from desktop to mobile – it mostly shifts to mobile web, and apps still account for a small portion of their mobile inventory.\nAnd so publishers are trying to compete on users’ attention by reimagining themselves in mobile environments. This will no doubt be including a mobile-specific video consumption experience. Better mobile-specific content and environment, along with first-party data that these large publishers can apply for targeting in their properties and beyond will contribute to increasing CPM rates.\nFacebook and Twitter are already there, at least in terms of in-app user experience and native display ad monetization. Video advertising is definitely next. Social and communication apps such as Snapchat and Tango are generating tons of video content and have figured out creative, relatively user-friendly ways to monetize it.\nIncreased standardization around this medium, better measurement capabilities (mostly around completion rates and viewable impressions but also TV-specific metrics such as GRP that provide a familiar benchmark for TV buyers) and increased targeting capabilities beyond device ID and lat/long (and with more video inventory, more refined targeting executions will be possible at scale) will go a long way in helping brands and agencies identify the right KPIs and quantify value. These understandings will lead them to allocate more dollars to a standalone mobile video budget item.\nMore sophisticated, video-specific pricing models will make it even easier for advertisers to not only better calculate their ROI but also shift the risk to the publisher side, making them even more open to this medium. Cost per thousand views (CPMV) will enable brands to only pay if their video ad was actually viewed by a user. Cost per Completed View (CPCV) takes it even further in minimizing the risk for advertisers who are only required to pay for an ad that was viewed in its entirety by a user.\nViews and especially completion rates are arguably indicators of engagement, but they are not easy to implement and require some market education. However, based on what we are seeing, these metrics and related pricing models assist to allay concerns among advertisers still new to the mobile video medium and, in my mind, will become the norm in the not-so-distant future.\nFinally, the way mobile video ads are sold also affects the evolution of this medium. Online video is still mostly sold through direct channels, as publishers prefer to secure the high CPM rates that they can command for such premium, in-demand inventory.\nThe largest brands and agencies work with video exchanges, but these marketplaces are considered less premium channels. Publishers are concerned about Real-Time Bidding (RTB)-based buying triggering a race to the bottom, resulting in low prices and sales-channel conflicts. This is especially true for mobile video, leading to a reality in which mobile video exchanges are having a difficult time getting their hands on premium inventory.\nThis will still be the case this year. However, with the development of more premium programmatic platforms such as private marketplaces (a private, more premium version of the current open exchange model) and programmatic direct (the automation of the current direct sale process), we are seeing that publishers are feeling more comfortable directing more of their premium ad inventory, including video, into those automated platforms. This change of perception is key to unlocking the true potential of online video in general and mobile video in particular.\nThe combination of increase in (premium) inventory, higher prices, clear KPIs for advertisers and publishers and the rise of more efficient, automated marketplaces to facilitate trade is guaranteed to take mobile video advertising to the next level.\n", "deleted" : false }

The simple, utilitarian site is a shining example of how the p2p Web can work, and one of the secrets to its success is the anonymization of its users by email forwarding and masking. Many people who wouldn’t want their real email addresses published can use an anonymous, temporary @cragislist.org address to keep things private while maintaining email as a valid form of commercial communication.\nGumiyo.com is working on a very similar concept, but for phone usage. Using its oh-so-Web 2.0 classified site to buy or sell items, a seller or buyer can be hooked up via telephone by using “disposable” phone numbers. If you find something you like, you enter your phone number and a verification code and hit “Send!”. Your number is auto-magically paired with a Gumiyo number and this number is sent to the seller. When he or she calls it, it basically forwards to yours. It even works with text messaging, a neat feature.\nIt’s free for sellers and buyers, and compliments Gumiyo’s other advanced features, like txtmsg notifications and threaded sale discussions.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5725fb6b21fb730001cde7f5" }, "companyIDs" : [ "ooma" ], "title" : "Get an Ooma Telo home phone system for $79.99 - CNET", "date" : { "$date" : "2014-04-10T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "content" : "Get an Ooma Telo home phone system for $79.99\nGet an Ooma Telo home phone system for $79.99\nThe time has come to bid goodbye to your landline. Install an Ooma and you're looking at nearly free home phone service for life.\nThis is an update of a deal I've written about a few times before. But it was a really popular one, and now it's even cheaper.\nOoma\nIt's time to cut the cord, landline-wise. In my house, phone service arrives over the interwebs, and has for as long as I can remember. The delivery mechanism? Ooma. Total cost for my home phone? Zero. (Well, very close to zero. Read on.)\nIf you're ready to tell your telco buh-bye, here's a replacement that should pay for itself in about two months: Today only, and while supplies last, Woot has the refurbished Ooma Telo home phone system for $79.99 , plus $5 for shipping. That's the lowest price I've seen yet.\nThe Telo is a touch-operated, answering machine-style black box that plugs into your router. (You'll need broadband Internet service for this, natch.) You then plug your existing cordless-phone base unit into the Telo. Presto: you've got dial tone, same as if you were still using a POTS line .\nOnce you own this hardware (which sells new for $149.99), you're looking at nearly free local and long-distance phone service -- forever. Your only bill will be for taxes and fees, which in my area come to around $3.50 per month.\nThat said, you might want to consider paying a little more. The included Ooma Basic service affords a handful of phone features : caller ID, voice mail, and so on. If you want extras like free calling to Canada, a second line, three-way calling, call forwarding (in the event of an Internet outage), and voice mail delivered via email, you'll need Ooma Premier , which runs $9.99 per month. (Best feature by far: call blacklisting, meaning you can block telemarketers and other unwanted callers.)\nAlso, porting your existing number costs $39.99 -- unless you prepay for a year of Premier ($119.99), in which case it's free.\nSo, yeah, Ooma does nickel-and-dime you a bit, but most of the extras are optional. And if you're currently paying, say, $35 per month for basic landline service, $120 for a full year of goodies is a great deal.\nAs for quality, I've been an Ooma user for about four years and couldn't be more satisfied. Even with the Telo installed \"behind\" my router (rather than in front, which is the recommended setup), call quality is much better than I ever got from Vonage. As for Ooma's customer service, I can't really comment because I've never had cause to use it. Everything just works.\nI realize lots of folks are abandoning their landlines altogether in favor of cell phones, but it's still a lot more convenient to have traditional cordless phones scattered around the house. Safer, too, as there's more likely to be a phone within reach in case of emergency. At just $80, this is hard to pass up.\nTanga\nBonus deal: Another of the more popular deals in Cheapskate history is back: Today only, Tanga is offering the Urge Basics Soundbrick portable Bluetooth speaker for $31.99 shipped when you apply coupon code BRICKSAVE at checkout.

Network    administrators should use this reminder to prepare their networks for    even greater demands in the coming months.\nResidents in the southern states of Louisiana and Mississippi – as well    as Arkansas, Tennessee and Alabama – were subjected to rain and flooding    of historic levels. Some 10 to 15 inches of rain set off flash floods in    parts of southwest Louisiana. President Obama has declared Louisiana a    “major disaster” area. Officials estimate that as many as 1,000 homes    could be flooded by the rising Leaf River in Hattiesburg, Petal and    surrounding areas in Mississippi.\nFor residents in those areas, immediate response from emergency    personnel is critical, as is open communication with insurance companies    to assess damage. Unfortunately, some computer networks serving that    area may see a slowdown due to unusually high demand.\nUnified Communications (UC), which combines messaging, email, voice and    video services, is increasingly being used by the insurance industry, as    well as emergency and volunteer workers, to coordinate among those    dispatched to stricken areas for disaster relief. When network demand    shows signs of exceeding acceptable thresholds, service providers must    react quickly or risk service slowdowns, call failures, or complete    outages.\n“It’s essential that network administrators who serve the affected area    be prepared for significant spikes in demand on their IT    infrastructure,” said Marcus MacNeill, Vice President of Product    Management at Zenoss, a provider of unified monitoring and service    analytics software. “When UC systems experience Quality of Services    issues or outages after a natural disaster, it can impact the speed at    which those affected can return their lives to normal.”\nMacNeill recommended that insurance agencies, emergency services, and    volunteer organizations employ IT infrastructure monitoring and    automated notification systems. By monitoring demand on their IT    networks, these organizations will ensure better uptime, and identify    possible risks to the performance of their UC capabilities before    services are compromised.\nThrough a partnership with LayerX Technologies, Zenoss recently expanded    its Unified Communications monitoring capabilities to allow customers to    view and analyze overall access, quality and performance. Zenoss has    launched UC Insight and Log Analytics, to provide end-to-end    monitoring across Unified Communications systems as well as physical,    virtual, and cloud-based IT infrastructures. The new offering provides    Quality of Service analysis for all UC devices and tools.\n“The best approach to take for critical systems is always a proactive    one,” said Zenoss’ MacNeill. “IT organizations that are responsible for    systems that by their very nature are subject to spikes in demand, need    to be extra vigilant to ensure that demand doesn’t hamper lifesaving    services.”\nAbout Zenoss:\nZenoss’ patented, agentless, and hyperscalable IT monitoring technology    is trusted by more than 35,000 organizations worldwide, including    Accenture, AT&T, BBC, CenturyLink, Cisco, Cognizant, HBO, Oracle,    Rackspace, Salesforce.com, Verizon, VMware, and US Army.

Well, that’s not stopping Aaron Crayford, who convinced a bunch of his supercomputer engineer buddies to put together Rippol , a video discovery site that blends hardcore machine learning with social streams. Rippol (not to be confused with rrripple , the media sharing site ) is coming out of stealth today into private beta. Be one of the first 1,000 people to try it by signing up here . (If you don’t get an invite, the site will be launching publicly in a month at our next Realtime Crunchup ).\nRippol is still in raw form (the UI needs more polish, not all the buttons work the way they should), but it is experimenting with some powerful ideas in online video. You can sign in with Facebook Connect, or create your own account (it will also support Twitter and Gmail sign-ins soon). Once you have friends on the system, it lets you discover new videos through your friends. The homepage is an activity stream of the videos you and your friends have watched, favorited, rated, and reviewed. And a global stream in the left column shows what the broader Rippol community is watching. Links to any video can also be shared on Facebook or Tweeted out.\nYou can click on any video mentioned in the stream to watch it, and chat with friends via Facebook Chat, which pops up from the bottom left of the browser window. Displaying videos as a realtime stream of information is a discovery mechanism that we are beginning to see in cutting-edge video sites like Magma (our review ). And I suspect it will become adopted more broadly.\nHowever, Rippol doesn’t rely solely on your friends’ activities to help you find interesting videos. The site is also a standalone video discovery engine in its own right. You can watch about 500,000 videos right now in the Rippol player, which can be detached like a chat box and moved around in front of the screen, while you search for more videos, check out your stream or chat with friends.\nRippol ingests videos from other sites like Hulu and YouTube and then it runs them through its “Butterfly Network” (see diagram at right, click for larger image). Here is where the machine learning comes in. The Butterfly Network looks at all of your video-related activities in the site, those of your friends, and those of people in your demographic. All of the videos on the site have particularly good metadata (titles, genres, actors, descriptions), which lets Rippol take advantage of data-mining techniques to recommend videos for you. It creates a genre cloud for different categories of videos (TV Shows, Movies, Sports, News),and then generates a list of videos for each genre tag you click on.\nDepending on what genre of videos you are looking for, Rippol’s realtime ranking servers shows you videos associated with ones you’ve watched or liked in the past, your friends have watched or liked, and people in your demographic have watched or liked. If you click on comedies and martial arts videos, those will rank higher for you in the future.\nSince Rippol has all the realtime stream data as well, the video results are skewed towards what people are watching right now. Your own actions impact the rankings the most, followed by those of your friends, followed by those of people in your age and gender group. And if you are a 45-year-old male who tends to watch videos more like a 25-year-old male, it adjusts the demo it associates with your actual watching habits.\nThe system is supposed to get smarter the more you use it, and the more your friends use it. So it’s hard to evaluate how effective it will be right now with only a handful of users, but it is a promising approach. Soon users will be able to suggest videos to add to the site. (Crayford says he’s come up with a novel way to filter out inappropriate videos from the broader community by taking into account what is acceptable to different social groups).\nCrayford’s last company, Vusion , specialized in high-definition video streaming over the Web. It’s patents, intellectual property, and other assets were acquired by the Clarendon Foundation in June, 2009. Craydon learned from that experience that advanced technology can only take you so far, and this time around he is trying to create a complete consumer experience rather than just an enabling technology. Rippol is completely bootstrapped so far.\nScreenshots:\n", "deleted" : false }

We encourage our members to review results of their tests and identify with those they had relationships with in the past, so they can get an idea of who would be a good match for them in the future.  Also, wouldn't it be nice, while users are waiting for their matches, for them to be able to search the database freely?  On PerfectMatch.com that’s a highly prized option.  On eHarmony, you just wait for someone else to decide your future.\nWhat are your thoughts on the progression of matching technology?\nIt's still very, very early days in the business.  I think the business has grown so quickly,  the technology hasn't been able to keep up.  As the space evolves, it's going to become more specialized...more member centric.  We make sure every single one of our members has the ability to have their profile reviewed on the site.  There are millions of members who don't quite get it and they need assistance.  So, we have a comprehensive 10 point review, from photo selection to the content in their profiles.  This review is available with our standard membership.  It's very important to make sure the membership is educated and someone takes the time to teach them what works and doesn't work.  We've developed our own leading-edge technology to have our member services team review all profiles.  We're constantly reinforcing to our membership 'they're not alone here.'  A few years back we saw a Jupiter report and most online personals members were on three or four sites.  The reason?  They don't really know how to use online dating.  They're just going to three  or four 'bars' at different times of the week.  We're making sure our members can leverage the vast experience we have, and greatly increase their odds of success.\nDo you really think you can trounce eHarmony?\nI have no doubt.  For us, my team got back into the space so we can compete and win.  We are actively seeking out partners.  Every time we compete with eHarmony on a proposed deal, we win.  Sitting back and looking at it, why are we winning?  We're not spending more money.  We are, however, willing to go beyond traditional ads and be creative.  Major brands will not work with eHarmony in this regard.  If I can be in situations head-to-head for business development, I love that.  Christian content is just not mainstream.  We look forward to crushing eHarmony.\neHarmony doesn't favor webcams?   Does PerfectMatch favor them?\nA few years ago we thought webcam usage would ramp pretty quickly.  One of the difficulties is the inability to audit what is going on in a community.  This is why many sites have struggled.  The same goes with recorded video.  We just don't have time to review it all.  Also, when we work so hard to build a brand, the last thing we want is a someone uploading inappropriate content. \neHarmony excludes homosexuals.  What’s PerfectMatch’s position on homosexuals?\nWe never have and never will judge our members.  We built a community to allow people to find sincere relationships, so of course, we allow individuals to pursue same sex relationships.  I find eHarmony's exclusion of homosexuals almost as appalling as the notion of them excluding people who've been married a couple of times...because the assumption is they never will be happy in a relationship.  To me, it’s absolutely laughable for some 70-year-old guy, who is sitting on the king’s throne in Pasadena, to judge men and women in this culture in such a way.  Relationships go bad.  But, that doesn't mean these people are not worthy of ultimately finding love.  It's really ridiculous. \nWhat does the future hold?\nWe're very excited for the online relationship and dating spaces.  Some exciting things are happening at both sites.  Dating sites like Yahoo Personals and Match, but we're still troubled with True's approach, though. We would like them to get away from the business of having to use suggestive female photos to drive members.  I think that hurts both the dating and relationships space.  We remain very committed and excited about the future.  We’re there to compete and win.  And, when we win, our members will win, by finding that special person. \nMark Brooks : After the interview Duane gave me a heads up on the following upcoming Dr Phil show...\n\"Finding Your PerfectMatch , June 3rd on Dr. Phil Dr. Phil wants to help make some love connections! Along with PerfectMatch.com, he's setting the entire studio audience up with their \"perfect match!\" Then, he kicks off \"The Dating Game\" ... Dr. Phil style! See what happens when Bree, who's been unlucky in love, quizzes three bachelors who are supposedly right for her and then chooses her man.

Manhunt recently acquired DList.com, a social networking site for the gay community. We have interviewed the founder of Manhunt, Jonathan Crutchley, and Online Buddies CEO Adam Segel about the merge and their marketing plans for DList.\n \nListen to the interview\nFor those not familiar with DList, can you describe the site?\nJonathan: DList is a social networking site for younger gay men. Users post videos and music clips and hang out chatting with friends, who could be anywhere, unlike with Manhunt , which was intended for guys to meet each other locally. DList was founded in 2006, and Online Buddies recently acquired it.\nHow did the idea to acquire DList come about?\nAdam: We had been friends with the owners of DList for quite some time, and we were watching the development of the social networking space. Manhunt is more a dating and connections website, while DList is a place for people to meet friends, explore art, music, etc. It was a different offering, and we wanted to make that available to men.\nOur ultimate goal is to be the largest and best place for men to meet men on the Internet. If they want to meet each other through a site like Manhunt, then that’s terrific. If they want to meet each other by sharing art, photos and things like that on DList, then that’s fantastic as well. We want to give all the mediums possible for men to be able to interact and meet each other.\nHow many members does Manhunt and DList have right now, respectively?\nJonathan: Manhunt has at least 2 million member subscriptions. Just under half of those are in the United States, and the rest are international. DList has about 180,000 subscribers at the start, and the idea is to grow it beyond that.\nAdam: We have already started marketing DList just this week, and we’ve already quintupled the number of people joining each day.\nJonathan: We’re doing more marketing under the new ownership than the previous owners of DList were able to do.\nHow are you marketing DList?\nJonathan: It was a couple of years ago, but we advertised Manhunt on MySpace one weekend. On the Friday night the ad appeared, the responses crashed our website. The place to advertise an Internet product is on the Internet.\nAdam: We started off by marketing DList through the Manhunt website and to the younger Manhunt members. We’re also marketing DList through events and promotions and through Facebook, MySpace and Google. We also advertise on some adult interest websites. The adult ’tube sites seem to do well for us.\nTell me more about these DList promotional events.\nAdam: We work with the gay and lesbian organizations at a lot of different colleges. We’re coming up with some different contests and promotions, like traveling DList parties. We just did our first party at Harvard. It was a joint with MIT, and we had tons of guys come. We want to continue to host these parties at other campuses across the country.\nWhat is the advertising budget for DList?\nAdam: Marketing for DList is part of the overall marketing budget for Online Buddies, which is between $3 and $4 million per year.\nWho would you consider DList’s competition to be?\nAdam: One of them is called Connexion. Another one is called JustGuys.net. But they’re much smaller. Plus, they don’t seem to have the traction that DList has, especially now with the power of Online Buddies behind it and the marketing might we’re able to give it.\nHow does DList currently make money?\nAdam: There are a few people who pay for some premium features. But the vast majority of the site is free, and the revenue is generated through advertising.\nDo you plan to make any changes to the revenue model?\nAdam: We aim to keep the website free so that more and more guys will use it, and thus we will be able to fund the website with advertising dollars.\nWe have a steady stream of advertisers now. We actually have advertisers waiting for us to make even more inventory available.\nAny changes to current DList content offerings?\nJonathan: I don’t know if we plan any immediate changes in content. I think the first problem will be marketing and increasing the number of subscribers.\nWho are some of your advertisers?\nAdam: Most of them are through ad networks. In the past, we have worked with American Express, BMW, some of the clothing companies, some movies, etc. Lady GaGa is someone who advertises on our site.\nDoes Online Buddies offer any packaged advertising deal across all its sites?\nAdam: Not yet, but it’s something we’re planning.\n", "deleted" : false }

He’s done very well with OnlineBootyCall and has turned some of his attention towards developing an interesting new site called HerWay.com . I interviewed Mo back in August 2007. (Full Disclosure: Mo is a client of Courtland Brooks )\nWhat did you do before you started OnlineBootyCall ?\nI was a software engineer. I worked as a database administrator and one of my side projects was an online dating site. That is how OnlineBootyCall started.\nWhy did you choose OnlineBootyCall? What other names did you consider?\nThere was really no name consideration. I just registered the domain so I could use it to do some web development and I had no idea the site was going to take off. I was the first member and now we’re close to 5 million members now.\nCongratulations. You’re working on a new site, HerWay.com . How does this site work and how is it different from other dating sites?\nHerWay, as the name implies, works a little differently. We set it up so it works similar to the Sadie Hawkins dance, a high school dance in which female students invite male students to dance. So on HerWay we allow the females to make the first move.\nIsn’t this a distinctly American concept?\nI would say 95% of the people I’ve asked heard of the concept. The dance idea started in the US but I’m not sure how many people internationally know about it.\nIt sounds like you’re empowering women but do women really want to be empowered in this particular respect or do the guys really want to lead?\nI wouldn’t necessarily call it empowering women. It is more about saving them from being inundated with emails from guys who they aren’t interested in. So giving them the opportunity to search for someone they really want versus fielding messages and responding to winks and stuff or responding to guys telling them they’re not interested, is a lot more efficient. One of the things we’ve noticed is women are often inundated and guys are often ignored on dating sites.\nSo it sounds like you’re trying to readdress the boundaries with HerWay.com?\nYeah I think so. I’ve talked to a lot of women who have joined the site and they appreciate it. It’s like a breath of fresh air. It’s not for everybody, of course. Some women like to be chased and they like the traditional dating experience.\nWhat inspired you to start HerWay.com?\nWhile operating OBC, I started noticing that whenever a female would reach out to a guy, the response rate was sometimes up to 10 times better than the other way around. So it led me to believe that it’s really up to the female to decide who she’s going to meet regardless of who initiates the contact.\nHow is the site growing? How are you getting the word out?\nRight now it’s mostly word of mouth. We’re growing at nearly 1000 members a day with little to no marketing efforts, which is going to change pretty soon.\nDo you have any other projects in the pipeline?\nWe do but it is a little too early to discuss right now. There are a couple of projects we’re excited about to get started. So when that comes up we’ll definitely let you know about that.\n", "deleted" : false }

I interviewed Lawrence Cervantes, Anastasia’s Chief Communications Officer, to understand more about Anastasia and what they’re about.\nWho are the founders of Anastasia, and what's their story?\nAnastasia was founded in 1993 by a Russian woman who immigrated to the U.S. and married an American. They named the company after Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia who was reportedly quite a young lady and a role model for young Russian women. The company actually began as a specialized tour operator once the Wall collapsed. The owners originally took groups of American men to Moscow and St. Petersburg on organized excursions to meet single Russian women. The company soon became a success and expanded operations to include more and more cities throughout Russia and Ukraine. Then in 2003 Anastasia went online and has achieved amazing growth year on year. Since then we’ve gone worldwide with 4 main sites: AnastasiaDate.com , AmoLatina.com , AsianBeauties.com , and AfricaBeauties.com .\nWhat business is AnastasiaDate in?\nAnastasia is in the business of international dating. We mix the concepts of international romance and modern love, and I’m happy to say that we have the lion’s share of the market. More and more it’s not just about domestic dating. As the net and travel break down barriers to business and society, more people are aware of the possibilities and ease of finding romance throughout the world. We enable that.\nHow many members does AnastasiaDate have now?\nOur family of sites connects over 4,000,000 members in over 110 countries, and we have regularly organized social activities throughout the year on 3 continents.\nWhere is AnastasiaDate based?\nWe have principle offices in New York and Moscow, with regional offices in Odessa, Ukraine, in Chongqing and Foshan, China, in Cebu the Philippines, and in Medellin, Colombia.\nDo you have a mobile app?\nAny day now…we’ll have more on a mobile application for Apple and Android within a few weeks and we’re very excited about that.\nHow is AnastasiaDate different from other Internet dating services?\nI like to say that we’re the next generation of dating. While the vast majority of dating sites have forever focused on domestic connections primarily with sometimes a smattering of foreign members, we concern ourselves with international relationships almost exclusively. As expanding facets of travel and tech enables the average person to discover and learn more about the world outside their own country, they discover new cultures, people, and realize the possibility for romance on another level. We help them connect. This concept is growing in scope and awareness, and is the reason we exist. It’s night and day a different direction and focus than most dating sites.\nHow do you make money?\nLike everyone we’re always looking for ways to create new revenue streams through technology, new services, improving what we have, better customer service which we’re very proud of by the way. I think like anyone will tell you, bringing home bacon is a cumulative effect, so we need to keep our finger on a lot of pulses. Whereas Chat hasn’t gone as far as we think it can in the U.S., internationally it’s done very well by us.\nWho are the users typically?\nOur demo is the 30 to 60 age group who are interested in romance and finding a mate from a number of countries. The U.S. contains the usual suspects, followed by UK, Germany, France and Italy. We’re big in Latin America especially Colombia, and China.\nWhat is AnastasiaDate focused on for 2013-2014?\nMobile is a big directional push as it’s growing on all internet user fronts. We’ve recently added considerable muscle to our senior management team, so there should be strong acceleration in growth. We’re looking afresh at acquisitions and ventures, and we’re growing more charity participation. I’m publishing a book, so stay tuned.\n", "deleted" : false }

A video of the full conversation will be added to this post shortly.\nTo kick off the conversation, Arrington asked Hoffman what he would do were he to take over Yahoo, which recently ousted CEO Carol Bartz. Hoffman said that he thinks a key thing for all tech companies to have is a solid strategy for where they’re going to build their product and innovate in the next 2-3 years, which Yahoo hasn’t done. He points out there are still business models we have yet to invent (Zynga’s success with virtual goods is one great example), and says that he’d try to focus Yahoo’s engineering talent on creating something new. He adds that the company has brand recognition, raw traffic, and valuable assets that could help such projects get traction.\nBut there are a few issues: it’s hard to get good talent to work at Yahoo, because it hasn’t been focused on creating new products, and there’s a concern that Yahoo’s cashflow — which much of which comes from its display ads business — might fall off more quickly than they expect.\nAnother interesting topic that came up during the conversation is Hoffman’s backing of QuestBridge , a company that works to find underprivileged, all-star students who probably wouldn’t even apply for college, and help connect them with top institutions (these students often receive significant offers of financial aide that would enable them to attend).\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

The goal of the new project is simple – “To effect positive change in the K-12 education space.”\nEveryone thinks they know exactly what schools need to do to start actually educating the youth of America well enough that they’ll have a fighting chance in the world. I, for example, think all we need is to bring good, old fashioned corporal punishment back into our school system. Right after we fire all the teachers, of course.\nI kid. But opinons really are all over the place. But one thing we all agree on – education could be and needs to be a lot better. Movies like Waiting For Superman help focus the attention on a possible solution. And people like Mark Zuckerberg are trying grande and noble experiments to see if they can make a difference.\nWhat if you’re a successful entrepreneur that wants to make real change in education? You find a way to bring technology, capitalism and entrepreneurism into the party, that’s what.\nRalston, who was last seen selling his music startup LaLa to Apple in 2009 , told me last week over coffee all about the new project. “We don’t have $100 million to give to a foundation like Mark Zuckerberg did, so we’re going to do something different,” he said.\nThe company is called Imagine K12. Like Y Combinator it will hunt for very early stage startups, give them enough funding to get through a few months of coding, and mentor them along the way. Each startup will receive $15,000 – $20,000 and give up an average of 6% of its equity. It’s a model that continues to work very well for Y Combinator. Ralston (pictured right) is joined by cofounders Tim Brady (left), previously CEO of education startup QuestBridge, and Alan Louie (center), who helped create Google.org.\nThe first class will work over the summer. Applications are being accepted until May 1 on their website, and they hope to accept 8 – 10 new companies. Y Combinator, by comparison, accepted more than 40 startups in their most recent batch, and have two separate “classes” per year.\nIs Y Combinator threatened, or even annoyed, by a niche focused clone? Absolutely not, says cofounder Paul Graham . By email, Paul said:\nWe’re big supporters of this project and have been talking to them about it since the beginning. We’ve told them everything about how YC works and brought them in to observe what we do. After they launch we’re going to publish a blog post encouraging startups working on software for schools to apply to them instead of us.\nI’m pretty excited to be able to do anything to help schools, even indirectly. After I watched Waiting for Superman I felt a bit bummed that I was spending all my time working on startups instead of trying to help schools. So I was delighted when an opportunity to help schools by working on startups dropped into my lap.\nOne of the ways Imagine K12 will help startups is by forging relationships with charter schools, public schools and education platform companies that can provide testing and distribution. “We will be able to test new products very quickly via these partnerships,” Ralston told me. It will certainly help these new startups avoid lengthy and overlapping business development cycles.\nImagine K12 is self funded by the three founders, who hope to quickly expand to two classes a year. The company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, in the new AOL building .\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

By January, Post will trumpet the site to consumers at large. The enterprise is a test of whether virtual worlds have a place in the modern landscape of gaming, where most of the excitement revolves around social games such as FarmVille, mobile games such as Angry Birds, or traditional console games and PC online titles such as World of Warcraft.\nA handful of virtual worlds that raised tens of millions of dollars have failed this year. The victims include There.com, Vivaty, and Metaplace. But that doesn’t deter Post, who says, “I haven’t seen anything that measures up to the quality of what I wanted to do. We are creating the first 3D virtual world for the mass market.”\nAs we wrote before , Next Island is a sci-fi adventure paradise built on top of infrastructure created by MindArk , which has created the massively multiplayer online virtual universe, Entropia Universe . The universe consists of a number of planets such as Planet Calypso . Next Island is a new planet in the universe. Unlike other worlds, the time travel theme gives Next Island a chance to have a wide diversity of imagery. The first major section that visitors can travel to is ancient Greece. Within that sub-world, players can go on a variety of missions. Other sections will come online over time.\nNext Island will be run as a free-to-play game, where users can create, purchase and trade virtual goods within the world. What’s distinct about Next Island is that users will be able to cash out, converting virtual money into real world money. That’s possible since Entropia runs its own virtual bank, which has been recognized as a real bank by Sweden (Entropia Universe is based in Sweden.) Over time, users will be able to travel from era to era and from planet to planet.\nPost founded Next Island in 2008. He was a serial entrepreneur who founded and sold both pager company Page America and Cellular Systems. So he funded Next Island himself in the hopes of reviving a childhood fantasy. Each day for a brief time when he was young, starting at the age of nine, he wrote the story about the parallel universe of Next Island, where it seems like paradise, but where danger lurks under the surface.\nThe back story is that the rich people of the world buy a set of islands and then create an isolated paradise hidden from the rest of the world. One of the islands has a portal into time that can be used to visit places such as ancient Greece. Players will teleport from age to age. If players acquire weapons in a modern age, they won’t be able to take them back to an earlier age. They’ll have to earn new weapons and use them to hunt monsters. You’ll also mine for valuable resources and use them to make things that can be sold for virtual currency.\nPost (pictured right) said he waited a decade to put together this business. About three years ago, he got serious about doing a virtual world. He met the MindArk people and decided to leverage all of the planet-building resources they had already developed. He recruited   John Jacobs, who goes by the avatar Neverdie in Calpyso , to help head his development studio. Jacobs became famous in 2005 because he mortgaged his house and spent $100,000 in real money on a virtual asteroid in the Entropia Universe. He opened a place called Club Neverdie and turned it into a real business. Post also recruited other luminaries in the game industry. Post has three employees and has hired 18 Neverdie developers to build his world.\nAt first, Post expect fans of Second Life and other virtual worlds to be interested in his world. Post wants to target people who appreciate the quality of something like World of Warcraft yet don’t have the time to devote to it. Post believes that “power casual” users, who play casual games such as FarmVille yet are looking for a step up, will be a key audience.\nSo far, Post’s outside investors include Loeb Partners, former Merrill Lynch media analyst Hal Vogel, Katlean de Monchy, Jon Jacobs and an unnamed banker from Citi.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

IMVU will offer 75 games from three partners to its community of more than 50 million registered users.\nIMVU is partnering with game companies Viximo (whose Top Modelz game is pictured above), Heyzap and OMGPOP. IMVU offers its users small virtual scenes, rather than big continuous virtual worlds. In those scenes, such as rooms or gardens, users can customize the look as they want. They can decorate their 3D avatars (or characters), design and buy their own attire, and chat with friends.\nNow, those users will be able to play social games with each other and thereby extend the length of time they play inside IMVU, said Cary Rosenzweig, chief executive of the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company. Eventually, the game experience will be more entertaining inside IMVU because users will be able to use their own avatars inside the games.\n“It’s a broader pivot for us into social entertainment,” Rosenzweig said. “Online entertainment, especially gaming, has grown up.”\nMeanwhile, virtual worlds are waning. Linden Labs’ Second Life had demonstrated some growth this year, but a variety of other virtual worlds, from Vivaty to Metaplace, have shut down . Rosenzweig says the pivot is important, but it’s not a drastic switch born of desperation.\nHe said the company has been steadily growing and that the addition of games will help it grow to a new level. IMVU already has strong social network and virtual goods elements, since users buy virtual currency in order to buy virtual items in IMVU. Now, the social games will take the company to the next level, Rosenzweig said.\nIMVU members can now log into the IMVU 3D chat or web site play 75 casual and social games, where the point is to meet new people and engage with friends. You can purchase in-game virtual goods while playing games such as Top Modelz, which is the IMVU-branded version of Viximo’s Photo Market game. You can also customize OMGPOP games with IMVU-specific virtual goods. And you can integrate IMVU avatar profiles and add friends from within OMGPOP games. Over time, users will be able to create more of their own games.\nIMVU was founded in 2004, has more than 10 million unique visitors a month, and is generated revenue on a $40 million-per-year run rate. In 2009, the company hit $25 million in revenue . The company’s virtual goods catalog has more than 4 million items, most of them created by its own members. The number of virtual items grows by 5,000 items every day. In the last 30 days, 30,000 users sold something to other members. About 85 percent of revenue comes directly from consumers, who pay for virtual currency.\n“We look forward to the integration of our enormous catalog of virtual items into our games,” Rosenzweig said.\nIn time, IMVU plans to extend beyond its own walled garden web site. It already has 1.35 million fans on Facebook, but hasn’t yet launched any Facebook apps.\nBackers include Menlo Ventures, Allegis Capital, Bridgescale Partners and Best Buy Capital. Rivals range from Second Life in the virtual world business to Zynga and hi5 in social games. The company has 100 employees.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

The network has already made $37 million and sold all of its ad revenue for March Madness On Demand, AdAge is reporting . However, other sites could also profit from the NCAA Men’s College Basketball Tournament, as almost half of its audience will follow games and scores online, according to a new report from Unicast .\nAs it turns out, March Madness is very much a two-screen experience for many viewers, with live streaming only being one of many parts to the puzzle. Eighty-three percent of its audience will watch it on TV, 44 percent will follow the tournament online and 10 percent will use a mobile device. Sports sites like ESPN.com (s DIS) and Yahoo Sports (s YHOO) should see a lot of traffic from fans trying to keep track of the scores, but the official CBS live stream at NCAA.com will see its fair share of users as well: 54 percent of the March Madness online and mobile audience actually wants to watch games in real time.\nAdvertisement\nUnicast’s new 2010 NCAA Basketball Tournament Fever Report reveals that 58 percent of the March Madness online audience want to use the medium to keep track of scores while 49 percent want to watch game highlights online. Catching up on complete games after they air is something that only 19 percent are interested in. Most users said they will flock to ESPN.com (69 percent), followed by Yahoo Sports (42 percent), FoxSports.com (s NWS) (34 percent) and CBSSports.com (29 percent). The official CBS-powered NCAA.com site was on the mind of 26 percent of the respondents.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n51 percent of the respondents don’t care about and won’t follow March Madness at all, which still leaves 49 percent ready to take work a little less seriously in the weeks to come. Out of those, 44 percent will go online. Put those pieces of pie into context, and you end up with the estimate that around 11.6 percent of U.S. adults are planing to tune into March Madness online. That’s a lot of eyeballs, even if not everyone follows through. Last year’s March Madness online coverage was seen by 7.52 million people, which generated a total of 8.6 million hours of live streaming video, according to CBS.\nAdvertisement\nAdAge reported yesterday that CBS has sold as many ads online as on TV this year. Of course, TV ad revenue still outweighs online, which was estimated to be around $619 million for last year’s March Madness. Still, online revenue is up 20 percent, which validates CBS’s strategy to stream the games in real time without any of the restrictions NBC (s GE) imposed on its Olympic coverage this year.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Mark Riffee Business\nDate of Publication: 11.04.11.\nTime of Publication: 11:43 am.\n11:43 am\nNYSE Tries to Get on Same Social Media Page as #OWS\nWhile hundreds of protesters in Zuccotti Park were still asleep inside tents and improvised tarpaulin shelters early Friday morning, corporations were learning about hashtags and “following” at the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) first-ever social media day .\nNew Media Strategies , a social-media-marketing consultant with a résumé that includes work for Disney and the NFL Players Union, hosted the event. Their goal: teach the members of NYSE-traded corporations how to effectively interact with the web community.\nThe time and place seem appropriate — the New York Stock Exchange is just two and a half blocks from the epicenter of Occupy Wall Street , a movement that is perhaps better identified as #OWS .\n#OWS is essentially a worldwide metaphorical loogie in the face of the same big corporations that were invited to participate in the NYSE event today, and social media is providing the saliva .\nPete Snyder, founder and CEO of New Media Strategies, tells Wired.com that though the event has been in the works for months, the relevance to Occupy isn’t lost on anyone. “What Occupy Wall Street is saying is, ‘Hey Wall Street, you need to listen more to consumers and activists,'” says Snyder. “That’s step number one.”\nThe second step is to actively engage in the conversation that #OWS protesters have started. From there, corporations can learn how to please their customers, monitor the quality of their employees’ experiences, and observe the competition.\nSeems like a simple — and logical — enough undertaking, but corporations are often image-conscious and obdurate. They tend to create what they believe is a prestigious identity and then indiscriminately sell it to the public. The problem is, if there is no forum for communication, the marketing strategists for these corporations won’t know whether their methods strike customers and investors as pretentious or off-putting until sales dip. Snyder says NYSE-traded companies have to remember that the public owns them and the best way to ensure success is to interact as intimately as possible with the people footing the bills.\nA panel of social media experts, which included representatives from Morton’s Restaurant Group and Verizon, suggested ways to get in-touch with the web audience. Verizon’s goals, for instance, are to communicate with consumers through video and mobile networking, tweet rather than e-mail press releases, frame products and services in narratives that customers can relate to, and create cross-platform integration.\nPlenty of corporations, especially those in the entertainment and news industries, have already mastered these techniques. But many haven’t, whether because they lack tech-savvy personnel or because they’re afraid to jump into a well-established — and often critical — conversation. What they need to realize, Synder says, is that the conversation is going to happen with or without them. “Ninety-nine percent of people aren’t always going to love you,” he says. “But you can take control by participating in the give and take.”\nSnyder is hopeful that social media can be the middle ground on which #OWS protesters and their foes, out-of-touch “ major banks and multinational corporations ,” find compromise.\nIt’s a tall order, but if politicians and corporations fail to join the conversation, said keynote speaker Christine Varney, an antitrust lawyer who has worked in the Clinton and Obama administrations, “the people who are occupying Wall Street may take matters into their own hands.”\nPhoto: Mark Riffee\n", "deleted" : false }

If you see something or think of something while outside away from your computer, you can text to 59479 (K-W-I-R-Y) and it will waiting for you at Kwiry.com and in your email.\nHooja , a secretive company, has just launched a similar texting service, though it is in testing mode, and apparently does not offer the same social components featured by Kwiry. Hooja is more focused on letting you publish the text messages on the Web. Hooja received funding from investor and former PayPal chief executive Peter Thiel. It was founded by Na’ama Moran, formerly at Greylock. Moran said he wants to wait a bit before talking more about the service.\nWhile these text-reminder services are not earth-shatteringly new, Kwiry says its service is different from existing offerings such as OTAir or Primiro because it brings a social element to the process, and is focused on regular people, not on serving businesses. It works within services such as Facebook, MyYahoo, NetVibes, Twitter and Jot, letting your friends also track your reminders. It works like the mini-feed of Facebook, broadcasting your reminders to them if you want your friends to see them.\nKwiry has partnered with companies like GamePro Magazine and HGTV to test marketing with Kwiry. Those media groups can advertise products with a short code. Then users can text the code to Kwiry’s 59479, and Kwiry sends the users an email with a link providing more information about the products. This is similar to what a competitor Mozes already does for bands ( see our coverage ). HGTV is testing Kwiry for the show “Don’t Sweat It”.\nWe covered Kwiry earlier this year when it raised $1 million from Hummer Winblad Venture Partners .\nupdate: We now hear Hooja has closed a $1.3 million seed round led by Peter Thiel. Angel investors Mike Maples, Yuval Shahar and Pascal Levensohn also participated.\nIn other announcements, Internet telephone company Jangl yesterday announded a service for Bebo users that lets them send and receive SMS messages from your mobile phone or PC without having to share their numbers.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPress Releases\n", "deleted" : false }

Pictures\nSpike Jonze’s film “ Her ” — which won the Academy Award for Original Screenplay on Sunday — has sparked a flurry of discourse about the forms intelligent assistants of the future will take. As CEO of Expect Labs, which is building a platform to power a new generation of intelligent assistants, here are the top five assistant-related myths I’ve heard — and the reality of what we can expect in the future.\nMyth 1: Intelligent assistants have emotions\nIf you’ve ever seen “Star Trek,” “2001: A Space Odyssey” or “Her,” it might appear that Hollywood is brainwashing us to believe that the pinnacle of machine intelligence is a computer’s ability to emotionally connect with humans. This idea, while it does serve as a captivating plotline, is not necessarily true. Anyone who has seen someone fall for a “ synthetic partner ,” or witnessed their child falling in love with a doll, knows that intelligence and emotion aren’t necessarily linked. Inanimate objects are not smarter because they can capture the heart of a flesh-and-blood person. Intelligence is not a two-dimensional experience; your intelligent assistant can still be smart, even if you don’t fall head over heels for it. As long as software can accomplish a given task, it should be deemed effective. We need to put an end to personifying our assistants just because we want another thing to pin our emotions onto. Technology is intended to dissolve the difficulties in our lives — not as a means to acquire adorable little sidekicks. Sure, we can like our assistants, but love should never be part of the equation.\nMyth 2: The first place we’ll use them is on our phones\nA smart smartphone assistant is not the gold standard. If you’ve ever waited for eons on a customer-support line just to ask a simple question, you’d probably give up all of your limbs for the most unintelligent assistant to come to your rescue. We can do better than this. Intelligent assistants will really come into their own when they’re used in narrow domains. This trend is already happening with the inception of in-car digital assistants: Mercedes-Benz unveiled its Prediction Engine at this year’s CES, and Hyundai recently announced that it is baking an assistant into its new Genesis car. It’s far more practical to have an intelligent assistant that can accurately anticipate and answer your questions about health policies and road conditions than having one on your phone that cannot even muster enough knowledge to do one thing right. Specific realms are where we’ll truly see intelligent assistants become most assistive.\nMyth 3: They have to talk back to you\nAnybody who has ever worked with an overly gregarious co-worker knows that sometimes the best trait is to be seen and not heard. It can be unnatural for objects to engage in two-way conversations with us. At their most basic level, assistants are meant to assist us. If digital assistants are busy devoting their precious computer brainpower to being good conversationalists, it detracts from what they were set out to accomplish. In “Iron Man,” Tony Stark’s assistant, J.A.R.V.I.S., which stands for “just a rather very intelligent assistant,” is both a helpful aide and best friend. But J.A.R.V.I.S.’s constant babble takes up a lot of its master’s time. If an intelligent assistant doesn’t understand a question, the best scenario would be if it presented users with a list of choices that they could then whittle down in a few simple steps. Conversation does not always equal intelligence. Who wants objects talking back to them, anyway? You have your kids for that.\nMyth 4: We will all have our own omniscient personal assistant\nWhile it is the stuff movies are made of, having one piece of software that is responsible for everything under the sun is not sustainable. In the coming years, there won’t be a universal personal assistant that can flit between each job in your life. Instead, each service we use, from an app to a website, will have an expert concierge housed inside. I do think it was really sweet that Samantha was able to submit Theodore Twombly’s manuscript to a publishing house and compose brilliant soundtracks all in the same breath — but that’s not realistic. In the future, we’ll be interacting with hundreds of personal assistants that are specifically optimized for each task that needs to be accomplished. For example, a symphony’s personal assistant that has an expert understanding of musical composition would assist with writing that next masterpiece — not a Samantha. When you go to the hospital, triage won’t be done by a doctor or the individual assistant on your phone, but by the hospital’s own hyperintelligent assistant. Armies of different intelligent assistants that operate with precision and finesse will trump master assistants that can barely do one thing right.\nMyth 5: Intelligent assistants will make us stupid\nImagine a future where intelligent assistants siphon us away from the mundane details that cloud our attention and direct us toward the most thought-provoking issues at hand: A cure for cancer, how to design the strongest bridge span, etc. Banal tasks, like making restaurant reservations, calculating tips, or conducting background research, will be a thing of the past. Back in 2007, Wired’s Clive Thompson wrote that “the perfect recall of silicon memory can be an enormous boon to thinking … the machine helps me rediscover things I’d forgotten I knew.” Could using intelligent assistants actually intensify our knowledge? Some assistants even go beyond simple “silicon memory” recall and can predict the information we need before we realize it ourselves. This ability to outsource menial tasks and proactively discover relevant content will free us up to live better. Intelligent assistants will — dare I say it — make us more intelligent.\nTimothy Tuttle is the founder and CEO of Expect Labs , a technology company that is building a platform to power a new generation of intelligent assistants. His first company, Bang Networks, built the Internet’s first large-scale CDN for real-time data; his second company, Truveo, built the Web’s second-largest video search platform, reaching more than 70 million monthly visitors, and was acquired by AOL.

Our ambitious plan was to run highly interactive game shows in which everyone was a contestant. Players could watch our hosts, answer questions, win prizes, form teams, call our studio, live chat, and run their own games. It was a huge undertaking, but despite great engagement — users watched for 87 minutes per session and 40 percent returned within a week — we didn’t reach enough users. We may revive it in the future, but for now, we’ve placed the site in hibernation and returned remaining funds to our investors.\nWhat follows is a post-mortem of what we did right and wrong and how we will improve next time. I feel too many entrepreneurs are afraid to discuss their failures, locking up important lessons. I hope you find some of this useful.\n1. Find quick money first. We were fortunate to know several top investors but we spun our wheels pitching too early and trying to optimize terms. Many entrepreneurs seek A-list investors first; quick (but not dumb) money is more valuable. There are only about 30 high-profile investors in the Valley, they all know each other , and they generally have enough deal flow to wait until risk is minimized.  Money is more valuable than advice or connections since there are easier sources for the latter.\nNext time, we’ll focus on strengthening our network of investors who are comfortable at the earliest stage and invest quickly, even if they don’t have a high profile (as long as there aren’t red flags). More than three meetings is too long and indicates your network isn’t broad enough or your pitch is poor.\nLesser-known investors also often have more time to give you. David Shen , previously unknown to us, initiated multiple deals and a site-wide design evaluation for us; it took one meeting for David to commit. You want to find 10 David Shens. Once you have traction, the Reid Hoffmans and Ron Conways will find you anyway.\n2. Content businesses suck (or: do it for love and expect to lose money). Producing quality content every day is a herculean task, especially live. The idea of creating both the content and technology for PlayCafe seemed achievable, but TV networks focus on distribution and studios on production for good reason: both are hard. Dev and I knew we were production novices but we thought live-filming a pretty girl delivering trivia with one camera guy was simple enough. We were wrong; the business was beyond our pay grade.\nWatch American Idol, the country’s most popular show, and you’ll see how often they screw up despite massive resources: sound and video fail, hosts and contestants stammer, camera angles are wrong, stretches get boring, and it happens despite a reality format that is simpler than live sports or news. They also don’t have to deal with DOS attacks, server downtime, scalability, or customer support like we did.\nI would advise any entrepreneur or investor considering content to think twice, as Howard Lindzon from Wallstrip warned us. Content is an order of magnitude harder than technology with an order less upside; no YouTube producer will earn within a hundredth of  $1.65 billion . This will only become more true as DVRs and media-sharing reduce revenues and pay-for-performance ads eliminate inefficient ad spend, of which there is a lot. The main and perhaps only reason to do content should be the love of creating it .\n3. Know when to value speed vs. stability. Another reason PlayCafe’s complexity hurt us is that developing good content and technology simultaneously required too much time. We tried to make each deep and stable — important, we thought, given our live nature — but we were too slow to iterate in a novelty- and entertainment-based business.\nA metaphor I like is that a chess novice can defeat a master if moving twice each round. This generally increases bugs and offends perfectionists, but I agree with Reid Hoffman that if you review your first site version and don’t feel embarrassment, you spent too much time on it.\nAn exception is when your product is mission-critical for users. An eBay outage is a catastrophe while a Twitter one is a joke . eBay iterates slowly partly because 1.3 million businesses depend on it. It has to get it right.\n4. Set a dollar value on your time. I agree with Paul Graham that good entrepreneurs are relentlessly resourceful , but I have a bad habit of bargain-hunting for sport. I spent three hours negotiating our wireless bill down $100, which was a poor use of time given our funding. The mantra to pinch pennies ignores the value of time.\nTime is arguably more valuable than money because you can’t raise more time. Dev suggested pricing our hours. You can divide your available work hours by salary, remaining funding, or total company costs. Ours was around $50/hour. If I was going to spend 5 hours negotiating, I’d have to save at least $250. This value should increase as you gain funding and traction. For anything greater than $500 at any stage, I’d still strive for NPR: Never Pay Retail.\n5. Marketing requires constant expertise. The main failure of PlayCafe was marketing. Dev and I came from PayPal, a strongly viral product at a company almost hostile to marketing . Our efforts in SEO, SEM, virality, platforms, PR, and partnerships weren’t terrible, but drawing users to a live event requires constant, skillful work.\nLike creating content, I no longer think marketing is something smart novices can figure out part-time. As the web gets super-saturated, marketing is the difference-maker , and it’s too deep a skill to leave to amateurs.\nAn exception is inherently viral ideas, especially one-to-many virality , where normal use of your product reaches new users, not “word-of-mouth” viral that requires users to advocate you. With inherent virality, a barely adequate product might suffice, though even then marketing should accelerate growth. Next time we’ll raise enough to hire a marketing expert early.\n6. Control and calculate your user acquisition costs. We initially conceived of marketing as a wildly creative exercise: filming viral videos , launching clever campaigns , pitching media players . That’s partly true, but the best marketing is controlled and calculated. If you know exactly how much it costs to acquire a user and you control the entire process, you then know how much capital and revenue you need, reducing your marketing plan from fuzzy guesswork to a clean formula.\nUntil you find a marketing expert , a place to start is the AdWords keyword tool , which shows you how many people Google for certain words, and the Traffic Estimator , which shows the rough cost of buying keyword ads on Google.com. Yahoo has similar tools . The ideal terms have a decent number of monthly searches (10,000+), low number of competing advertisers (3 or less), and strong relevance to your site.\nFor example, “game TV shows” has 12,100 monthly searches with 7 currently competing ads, while “2008 game show” has 14,800 monthly searches with only 1 ad. The relevance of these searchers is roughly the same so the latter is a better chance to acquire users cheaply. Your first users are the most expensive and can cost $10-20/user, but the cost should decline as your brand and word-of-mouth grows. The promised land is when you convert and monetize well enough to literally buy users .\nOther tactics to control and calculate include A/B testing, tracking sign-up and purchase conversion, and creating landing pages to drive SEO and track different campaigns; look at the bottom of Mint.com for a good example. For fuzzier marketing tactics like blogs and press, knowing the time you spend on each, the value of your time, and your break-even acquisition cost will help you calculate efforts that aren’t cost-effective. A data-driven culture is a well-oiled machine.\nI would also avoid money pits like PR firms, CPM ads, billboards, and TV/radio spots. We wasted $5,000 on a promoter who produced almost no buzz then said it takes a few $5,000 sprees to see results. Unless you control and calculate, these methods are mainly for marketers bad at math .\n7. Form partner relationships early, even if informal. Two downsides of partnerships are that they’re slow and you lack control, but they do have advantages beyond driving users and revenues. Partners can make connections, teach you the market, flag potential competitors, and become potential acquirers. Believing we had little leverage, we de-prioritized several partners who later said they might have bought us if we had built a stronger relationship and proven our value.\nWe learned that you can build informal relationships with little time. Meeting decision-makers early, keeping them in the loop, and being genuinely helpful builds familiarity and goodwill, which reaps some of the above benefits without the pain of hashing out a deal . It takes foresight and maintenance, but dating before getting married also makes it more likely the partnership will be healthy.\n8. Plan costs conservatively and err on the side of raising too much. While I’m doubtful more funding would have made the difference in our case, it would have let us try more tactics. We did a detailed financial plan, but I underestimated costs to fully expand. Next time we’ll better know real costs and likely bite the dilution bullet to raise a bit more than needed. This also prevents spending a lot of time raising extra rounds.\nGlenn Kelman from Redfin has some nice common costs . To refine, ask a successful entrepreneur for a previous financial plan to vet yours. I disagree with folks who think financial plans are a waste. They are indeed wrong the moment you start, but they help you estimate headcount, fundraising, break-even, and whether your business model is insane .\n9. The key to negotiating is having options. The single most useful piece of advice I got was from Bill Trenchard , founder of LiveOps: “Always have options.”\nAlmost everything you do as a founder/CEO involves negotiation: closing investors, hiring employees, signing partners, paying vendors, even advocating features internally. The best way to persuade your counter-parties is signaling — implicitly or explicitly — that you have viable options (also called BATNAs ). Just two can be enough. Being at the mercy of a lone option is a recipe for getting screwed .\nThe more humans are involved, the more negotiable the system. If you hear a human say “ that’s our policy ” without much reason, bells should go off that you have room to negotiate if you reach the right decision-maker. Be nice, ask to speak with a manager, and politely signal that your endurance will outpace their patience. Higher-ups know the value of time and make exceptions accordingly. Sales managers are especially persuadable because they’re social and work on commission.\nThat so much of a founder’s job involves negotiation also means work can get adversarial and lonely . It really helps to have a group of friends you don’t have to haggle with.\n10. Knowing isn’t enough. Most frustrating is that Dev and I knew much of the above going in. We’ve been doing this for 10 years each across three startups (though this is our first significant one at the helm). I could have sent this to myself two years ago and probably would have thought what many of you are thinking: this is nothing new .\nWhat’s new for me is painfully experiencing the gap between knowing and doing. Advice is thrown liberally around the Valley, but like a surgeon who has studied but never practiced, I think it takes a lot of hands-on experience to learn intricacies and exceptions. I think advisers should more often say, “You probably won’t get what I’m saying until you screw it up.” Expertise takes time , and pithiness comes with a cost.\nPlenty of useful advice conflicts for this reason: Know Your Customer vs. Build For Yourself, Don’t Raise Too Much vs. Don’t Raise Too Little . The better answer to these questions is It Depends. Advice isn’t like code that’s easily executed, but like map coordinates that require skill and context. My hope is that our experience brings us (and you) a little closer to that .\nMark Goldenson lives in Palo Alto, Calif.

As of this article, the only way to load CWMod is in the directions described above\nLoad TnT Lite from the ROM Manager\nWait for TnT to load.  This should bring you to 3.1\nReboot into recovery and run the update contained in 3.1.2\nWait, what is up with the Market?\nWell, by default, the G Tablet does not come with the Android Market, which should be no surprise to most tablet owners, as that is slated for the Honeycomb release. TnT Lite automatically loads the new Market for you in the ROM. The only issue is that it needs a small push to detect most of the apps. Here is what has to be done:\nDownload Titanium Backup ( our mirror ) and copy it to your device's SD card. Find the APK using ES File Explorer and run the installation\nGo into Settings – Applications – Manage Applications - and Force Stop both the Market and Google Services Framework apps\nOpen up Titanium Backup, go to Backup/Restore and look for Google Services Framework, select it, then select “Wipe Data”\nGo back to your home screen and open up the Market. You should get an error. If not, redo steps 2 and 3 until you do\nReboot your device. After it starts back up let it sit for a minute or two to let things in the operating system normalize. Open the Market. Reboot your device\nOpen the Market again and enjoy\nNow this gives you access to most of the Market. The process to give you access to the whole Market is a little bit more complicated and can be found here , but I was fine with 99% of the Market working.\nOverall, the Market worked well, but as you see from these screenshots, there are a few glitches:\n \nOK, I got it set up, what's next?\nI will focus on the apps that I wanted to use and have tested out, and you will see my results.\nEmail & News\nI use the stock Gmail application to retrieve my emails, and it works very well. All of the feature updates I saw on my EVO were applied here as well. Here is a snapshot of what Gmail looks like on the G Tablet:\nFor news, I love USA Today. It is not my primary news source, but for a quick review on what is going on, it works very well. Here is a snapshot of how the app looks on the tablet:\nMusic\nFor music playback, I typically use Pandora and Sirius/XM Android Radio. Pandora worked very well, but Sirius/XM got stuck on the “Checking for Updates” screen. Winamp also performed well.\nHere are some screenshots of Sirius/Pandora/Winamp:\n \n", "deleted" : false }

Millennials and others want instant access to their financial data and the ability to manage their money. Financial services firms know that's where their clients are going, so they are rushing to incorporate these new technologies before their customers move on.\nThe newest apps range from offering investment advice and enabling stock purchases to crowd funding, online payments and exchanging money (think PayPal or Square). Many involve a \"social\" aspect, allowing a connected generation to see what others are doing or to share advice and woes.\nQuicken, the still-great program that sits on your desktop computer, is so passe! Now, free apps like Mint and Mint Bills have more immediate appeal. Apple Pay makes it easy to purchase goods by touching your smartphone or Apple Watch. Even Walmart is adding smart bill payment to its mobile app!\nIt takes a conscious effort to keep up with financial technology that can make your life easier. Here are a few examples, most of which I've written about over the past year:\n--Mint and Mint Bills: These are two separate free apps. Mint came first, offering budgeting advice and categories, along with a convenient dashboard for seeing where all your money is -- and where it went! It's free because it allows advertisers to ping you with offers of lower rate cards and so forth. But the app also sends you immediate notification when you are about to overspend your own budgeted limits for entertainment or dining out!\nThe one thing that Mint doesn't do -- pay your bills -- has been remedied by the Mint Bills app, which I first wrote about in early 2015. It's simple, allowing you to view all your bills, schedule payments and make sure you have enough money to cover them! It gets my vote for App of the Year!\n--Acorns: Everyone agrees that there is never \"enough\" money to set aside for investments. So this free app makes it easy to find the cash, automatically rounding up all your checking and credit card purchases for accounts you enroll, then sweeping those extra pennies into a stock fund every time you accumulate $5 in extra pennies! You can always add more cash -- and you can get your money back if you need it. But the whole idea is that this almost imperceptible process will help you build a long-term, growing investment account. It's the modern-day version of a penny jar!\nSimilarly, Stockpile.com allows parents and grandparents to give a giftcard ranging in value from #25 to $100 for the purchase of any stock chosen by the recipient. They're available at many retails stores -- or at the company website, where you can gift up to $1,000 of stock. Low fees, and ease for the recipient to activate the gift card and open the account make this a real innovation.\n-- BUDGT and Wally: Throw out the old budget book, paper receipts and pencil sharpener. Two apps, BUDGT (not a misspelling!) and Wally, will help you track expenses so at least you know where the money went -- and in what categories. This easy technology is especially helpful if you file an expense report, want to track deductible expenses or simply want to gain control over your spending habits.\n--SoFi.com: Refinancing student loans at lower rates for college grads that have good credit and good jobs is the specialty of this new service. SoFi has already funded over $6 billion in loans, now adding personal loans and mortgages to its portfolio of student loans. SoFi stands for \"social finance\" -- a key ingredient in the \"do well by doing good\" aspect of their mission. Save a fortune in interest if you qualify to refi your college or grad student loans.\n--Robo investing: There are so many good apps and programs, it's hard to choose the best. But check out Betterment, Wealthfront, and Personal Capital. All offer diversification, simplicity, organization and free or very inexpensive advice and investment alternatives. The brokerage industry is worried you won't need them anymore -- and millennials seem to agree!\nThere will be more new apps and innovations to review in the year ahead to help you gain control over your finances and make the most of your money. Now it's up to you to try them. And that's The Savage Truth.\nFollow Terry Savage on Twitter: www.twitter.com/TerryTalksMoney\n", "deleted" : false }

Not because they ran out of money, but because Hercules Technology Growth Capital , one of their backers, had seized the company and was shutting it down.\nCEO Scott Cahill confirmed the shutdown yesterday in an email to investors, saying that Hercules had “foreclosed on its collateral and has sold the company’s intellectual property to a third party”:\nFrom: “Cahill, Scott”\nDate: Wed, 3 Jun 2009 16:42:29 -0400\nTo:\nSubject: Final Kadoink Update\nDear Angel Investor:\nThis is the final update on Kadoink. On Friday, May 30th, Kadoink completed the sale of its assets. As the attached letter indicates, the company contacted over 600 parties to determine interest in an acquisition of the company’s assets. Of those, 22 expressed interest. Following a due diligence period, the Company received 6 bids for the acquisition of the Company’s intellectual property. Unfortunately, the highest offer was insufficient to pay the company’s secured lender in full. The company’s secured lender, Hercules Technology II, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. has foreclosed on its collateral and has sold the company’s intellectual property to a third party. While the details of the transaction between Hercules and the buyer are subject to a confidentiality provision, the company can assure investors that the purchaser is not an insider and the transaction was arms-length.\nThe Company’s inability to pay its secured creditor in full means that that the Company, with certainty, is unable to make any payments on the general unsecured claims against it. Additionally, investors will receive no return on their investment. The company will be dissolved under state law. Please consult with your tax advisor regarding how you, or your organization, should handle losses arising from the closure of the company.\nOn a final note, I regret that we were unable to return at least some portion of your investment to you.  While we were optimistic at the start of the process that this might be achievable and we were ultimately satisfied with the size of the top bidders given what we learned over time regarding sales such as ours, it is disappointing nonetheless.\nI wish you all the best in your future endeavors and investments.\nBest Regards,\nScott\nVenture debt looks extremely attractive when things are going well for a startup. The dilution to shareholders is minimal, usually just some warrants attached to the debt. It can make a lot of sense to raise debt when building out infrastructure, particularly since the debt can be secured against hardware being purchased.\nBut the terms of the debt are key, particularly under what circumstances the creditor can come in and shut down the company. Many creditors look for triggers in the financial statements that give them the right to seize assets. That’s likely what happened with Kadoink, and it’s a sad way to end a company that may still have a shot at doing something interesting. Smart entrepreneurs only accept debt agreements that require nothing but payments to be made on time. As long as those payments come in, the creditor has to stay away. Terms are usually less attractive, but in the end it may save you from the deadpool .\n", "deleted" : false }

From million dollar packages for engineers to secretive soft landings, these peculiarly Silicon Valley transactions are shape-shifters, changing to the tastes of various parties at different market conditions. Like a political issue that draws passionate debate, acquihires are represented by icons that stand in for larger issues, even if the icons aren’t always accurate—such as engineers getting million dollar packages or young 20-somethings driving fancy sports cars.\nThis article analyzes the history and context of acquihires as a way to explain technology mergers & acquisitions and Silicon Valley’s startup ecosystem. By doing this, we’ll also explain where acquihires are today. Acquihires haven’t gone away, contrary to some reports, and still happen. But their purpose and prices have changed significantly, as the market and industry have changed. While they were once hyped in the media, now they are largely out of sight.\nFar Reaching\nAcquihires can best be understood as a function of Silicon Valley’s tech startup and angel and venture capital system. They touch many parts of Silicon Valley: big name tech companies and small startups, venture capitalists, wealth creation, entrepreneurs’ reputation, public relations, and deal making.\nSince 2005 and especially since 2008, the growth of seed funding has generated a massive ecosystem of seed funded startups.[1] Today, the growth of sites such as AngelList has made raising seed funding more accessible than ever. There were 976 companies seed funded in 2014 , per CB Insights, compared with 309 seed deals in 2010 (Seed funding dropped in 2015 , but remains much higher than in earlier years). Meanwhile, there has been much less growth in Series A and B funding, which has left a gap for seed startups. Even without the growth in seed funding, there is a whittling of seed-funded companies as venture capitalists pick off the cream of the crop for larger funding rounds as they bet on the next “unicorns.” While seed startups search for funding, there is simultaneously a shortage of top engineering talent in Silicon Valley. As a result, large companies are in search of top talent through acquihires, which gives companies the opportunity to scoop up top talent, for a relatively cheap price.\nBenefits\nThe benefits of acquihires for sellers is that startup founders and some portion of their employees (often not all) can join a larger company and receive some cash or equity compensation, which can be a signing bonus, retention package or other package. Also, importantly, the founders can then say they were “acquired by Google” or some other large company. In addition to potential tax benefits, this is a face saving measure.  It gives them cultural capital, and a leg up in starting a future startup. This is an important marker of success in this entrepreneurial ecosystem, even if a founder’s colleagues know that the startup essentially failed.\nThe benefits for buyers are threefold: first, they can can hire a large number of engineers quickly. This is no small achievement for companies with large product roadmaps, or for their recruiters, who have marching orders to hire dozens if not hundreds in the next several months. While an acquihire is rarely simple, the work that goes into it can be justified by the addition of a top team. Secondly, an acquihire brings a team that already has worked together. So they should be able to work together well and quickly get up to speed on a project. That kind of team can take much longer to build when hiring individually.\nThird, as will be discussed below, prices have fallen dramatically for acquihires and have been down for some time. So, some large companies have realized that, if executed right, an acquihire can bring in top talent at a relatively cheap price. These teams can be acquired at prices that are not much more than what the individual hires would have cost through a traditional hiring or recruiting process.\nHiring Problems and Perception Issues\nSo what are the potential problems with acquihires? The main arguments: First, they’re bad for buyers: Acquihires don’t solve the talent problem for a buyer, particularly in the long term. Top entrepreneurial talent will leave as soon as they can, some argue. While it’s true that entrepreneurial talent may leave, there are many that have been acquired and stayed under the right circumstances. Facebook and Twitter, for example, have been successful in keeping some of their top acquired talent.\nSecondly, according to some, existing employees at a buying company get resentful of acquired startup employees making tons of money to do essentially the same job. This can incentivize existing employees to leave to work at a startup. This scenario is possible. But not acquiring any companies seems unrealistic for most fast growing companies. Instead companies can have strong incentive programs for existing employees. A company doesn’t have to choose between these options.\nThird, acquihires perpetuate the lack of talent by making failure too easy by providing “soft landings,” the argument goes. But few of the thousands of entrepreneurs starting companies each year are doing so with a soft landing in mind. They start companies because 1) they have an entrepreneurial itch or work better in a startup environment; 2) they’re willing to take risk; and 3) they’re interested in a larger financial payoff. Soft landings do make it easier to take risk and start a company. But on the list of reasons people start companies, soft landings are low, if there at all. And even if this is a fallback option that entrepreneurs keep in their mind, is that a bad thing? Is it bad that entrepreneurs are incentivized to take risk to create and innovate?\nFinally, some say acquihires are bad for the market and are just fake . Entrepreneurs shouldn’t be able to claim a victory by listing “acquired by Google” on their resume, when they were acquihired in a last ditch effort to save face before shutting down a company. This isn’t little league, where all sides of a  game get trophies, the argument goes.\nThis is about perception, which is important to founders, VCs and many others in the industry. Whether you agree with them or not, to eliminate the face-saving and resume-building and “branding” effects of acquihires (putting aside the other tangible benefits listed above) seems difficult without dispensing with the entire system of media, reputation and “branding” in Silicon Valley. That is, the tech industry’s many companies’ and venture firms’ generation of press coverage with the help of many public relations firms. To be “acquihired” is part—a relatively small part—of this much larger system. This isn’t a judgment for or against.\nEach group is affected differently in acquihires: Venture capitalists, for example, are often loath to accept an acquihire. While investors get to claim their startup was “acquired by Google,” this can also mean they lose money. Sometimes VCs get pennies on the dollar for their investment or nothing at all, while an entrepreneur walks away with a nice employment package at an acquirer. Today, these kinds of situations are less common (and VCs can at least get their money back), but they still happen. Many buyers, even those who are known for offering these deals that cut VCs out, know that they should consider VC interests if they ever want to do a deal with those VCs again. Still, many VCs, who want to be known as “founder friendly,” will ultimately support an acquihire if it’s the best outcome available for the founders and team.\nA related reason VCs dislike acquihires: they’re associated with entrepreneurs who just want a “quick flip” and are not building a company for the long term. In other words, founders just give up and don’t stick it out, but instead just opt for the easy acquihire. VCs are right to be concerned about this. But at the same time, founders can be trying to build a massive business and still come across a strong offer early in a company’s existence. There are often good reasons to sell at this point.\n11 Years Later\nThe first use of the word “acqhire” (online at least) was on May 11, 2005 on  Rex Hammock’s Rexblog , which coined the term to describe Google’s acquisition of the tiny two-person New York City social location startup Dodgeball. Hammock noted that a $62 billion company buying a two person company and asked, “isn’t that more like a ‘hire’ with a signing bonus?” The startup was otherwise notable because Dennis Crowley was one of the two founders who, after leaving Google in 2007, later went on to found Foursquare. (Language expert Ben Zimmer analyzed the origin of the term “ acqhire” here. )\nGoogle was known for acquihires in this period of rapid growth. (It’s notable that a number of Google corporate development executives have gone on to work at other fast growing Silicon Valley companies such as Square, Pinterest and Facebook, taking similar methods with them.) Not all of these early Google deals shut down the acquired product immediately, though many were shut down later .\nThe rise of Facebook brought the next large wave of acquihires. The New York Times in May 2011  chronicled the phenomenon of “acqhires,” the largest of which was Facebook’s  $47 million 2009 deal for startup FriendFeed, which was the equivalent of costing about $4 million per engineer. Bret Taylor, cofounder of FriendFeed, became CTO of Facebook, while Paul Buchheit, another cofounder and a key former Google employee, also joined Facebook. The story also cited Facebook’s 2010 acquisition of drop.io  mostly just for its founder Sam Lessin, who went on to hold key roles at Facebook. Facebook’s head of corporate development pegged the price of acquihires at $500,000 to $1 million per engineer. Later, another notable deal was in March 2012, when Google acquired Milk , a small startup cofounded by Kevin Rose of Digg fame, and its team of designers at a substantial price.\nThis pre-IPO Facebook period was a key moment. The listing took place on May 18, 2012. In the lead up to it, Facebook was hungrily snapping up startups. At the time in early 2011, Facebook’s private market valuation was a staggering $50 billion , so the company had equity to acquire top talent.\nAcquihires during this pre-Facebook IPO time were a high-end commodity, a product of an overheated market and highly capitalized buyers. While Facebook’s use of acquihires followed and continued Google’s approach, Facebook became more well known, whether true or not, for splashy deals paying high prices for acquihires—and made acquihires a more common term in the industry. Facebook needed top talent, particularly in the mobile sector as it transitioned to mobile. Meanwhile, others such as Google, Yahoo and Twitter were also trying to keep pace—by acquihiring top talent as well.\nA Change in Use–and Perception\nToday, some, have declared the “end of the acquihire,” citing a slowdown in these deals among Google, Yahoo and Facebook, three of the most active in this space from 2005 to 2012. But acquihires actually haven’t disappeared, they’ve just changed. Several things are going on:\nFirst, acquihire prices have dropped—since the Facebook IPO, prices have come way down. Facebook’s appetite for acquihires has dropped since its IPO, as is common with companies after an IPO and after a period of rapid growth. Since its IPO, there have been few media stories about Facebook or anyone else doing acquihires with $1 million-per-head deals. The truth is, these high-priced acquihire deals were always fairly rare. Since 2012, they have become even more rare. So really, prices on acquihires have been lower since 2012. The “end of acquihires” if that means lower prices, has been here since 2012. Another reason prices have dropped? Besides, Facebook’s IPO, there is:\nSecond, buyers have become much more savvy about acquihires. They generally don’t see acquihires as Facebook saw them in 2011. Large buyers want to buy very specific teams with specific product skills. They don’t want to pay high prices and they know that there are enough startups looking for acquihires that they don’t have to overpay for them.\nThird, as the same CB Insights report noted, large private companies like Dropbox, Pinterest and Airbnb have taken up some of the slack that previous pre-IPO companies filled with acquihires. There are a number of other large private tech companies that have used their valuable stock to snap up startups. This is an increasingly common tactic for a company seeking to grow quickly or consolidate a sector or market. If valuations of unicorns continue to drop as the market weakens, this may change, but up until now these companies have been quite active.\nFourth, as noted above, venture capitalists generally dislike if not outright oppose acquihires. They particularly oppose them if the founders and/or team walk away with cash and investors lose money. Investors will go along if all other options have been explored and/or the deal pays investors back at least some of if not all their investment dollars. As a result many founders are much more careful about taking an acquihire deal unless investors get substantial considerations.\nFifth, perception is still a major factor in acquihires. As a result, many acquihires are not identified as acquihires in news coverage—they’re often simply reported as $10 million or $25 million or $50 million acquisitions. Prices that are reported are often wildly inaccurate. So to accurately and precisely measure acquihires (which Exitround has been doing) is quite difficult. To say they’re gone, when the majority are not reported publicly in the media or anywhere else, is hard to believe.\nFinally, as mentioned earlier, large buyers are still very active in looking at and consummating acquihire deals. Virtually every major tech company in Silicon Valley is still open to, if not actively doing, acquihires–with varying levels of interest depending on the sector and type of team. Very few will hear about a talented team on the market and say, “No, I won’t look at that.” There are so many startups that large companies know that there are many options for these deals.\nAcquihires are a unique and revealing product of the Silicon Valley startup and venture funding system. Until another solution comes along, they’re a pragmatic part of the startup lifecycle, as entrepreneurs cycle through founding, building, selling and often, later, starting a new company. And perception is a key part of this system. Whether you think they’re good or bad, they show how much perception and reputation matters to every entrepreneur and venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, be it on social media, press or among colleagues. Silicon Valley is a place where “personal branding” is a thing discussed without irony. In this wider context, acquihires are considered a relatively modest and pragmatic measure that many take.\nMeanwhile prices of these deals have dropped as their usage has changed over the years, from what were glamorous in earlier years to much more mundane and pragmatic in recent years. Interestingly, acquihires are a legal and transactional device, while also accomplishing a social goal, in a way that few other types of deals are in Silicon Valley. While successful venture rounds, M&A deals or IPOs evoke simple “success stories,” and “down rounds” or company job cuts or “shut down” stories are also relatively simple failure stories, acquihires are much more opaque and complicated. They have multiple, often conflicting parties (even among the same venture firm or startup or board), which is perhaps why they are so little understood, despite how often they happen everyday in Silicon Valley.\n[1] What “small” is has changed over the years from a few hundred thousand dollars to now sometimes up to $2 million or more.\nSign up as a a buyer or seller on Exitround.

You plug them in, watch them spin, and then replace them when they die. Hopefully somewhere in there you back them up and maybe reformat them, just to switch things up a little, but you’re pretty much dealing with a bucket of metal platters that store information.\nEnter the SimpleTech [re]Drive . I’d wager that this drive is probably one of the best external devices I’ve seen. It does what drives are supposed to do – it reads and writes data at USB 2.0 speeds – and is surprisingly cool and silent.\nThe drive is clad in aluminum and bamboo. The top and bottom look like they’re made of balsa wood while the side panels have an odd texture that suggests a clever heat-sink. Even though this is a 500 gigabyte hard drive, it spins up silently and makes nary a whisper during operation. A similar drive, also 500GB sitting next to it, sounds like a jet taking off.\nThe drive includes a power supply and standard USB cable. It also has backup software stored on the drive along with support for Fabrik , an online sharing system we’ve reviewed before. Fabrik support offers online storage of your images, documents, and media. A link to Joggle.com is also included, which is another service aimed at sharing pictures and video with friends and family.\nThe drive is formatted in NTFS out of the box and requires a reformat for OS X support. It includes a Turbo USB driver for faster disk access – about 20% over standard rates – offering 480-500 Mbps on a good day. Best of all, the drive turns off when the PC or Mac is turned off, ensuring that the drive’s green pedigree isn’t all just lip service.\nDrives can’t really be revolutionary, but the $159.99 [re]Drive comes pretty close.\nFABRIK LAUNCHES WORLD’S MOST ECO-FRIENDLY EXTERNAL DRIVE\nNew SimpleTech [re]drive with Turbo USB 2.0 Provides Consumers with an Energy-Efficient, Fast, Reliable and More Sustainable Alternative for Storing and Protecting Digital Files\nSan Mateo and Santa Ana, Calif, July 28, 2008 – Bump up your green meter with Fabrik’s (www.fabrik.com) new SimpleTech [re]drive™, the world’s most energy-efficient, resource-conscious, Turbo USB 2.0 external storage and backup drive. From its sustainable bamboo and recyclable aluminum enclosure, to its packaging and Energy Star® power adaptor, the SimpleTech [re]drive helps make the world a little greener while storing and protecting your data. With Turbo USB 2.0, which delivers up to 25 percent faster performance than USB 2.0, the [re]drive is speedy and reliable with plug n’ play simplicity for both Mac and PC users. To help you steer clear of life’s little digital disasters, the SimpleTech [re]drive’s automated backup software saves copies of your stuff on the drive, and on encrypted, secure servers using Fabrik Ultimate Backup (www.FabrikUltimateBackup.com) for ultimate online backup protection.\n“Many consumers are concerned with helping solve the most important environmental issue of our time – protecting our planet from the threats of climate change,” said Matt McRae, vice president of marketing at Fabrik. “At Fabrik, we’re making an effort to support the environment, while adapting our products to better meet consumer needs and interests. We know we have a lot more work to do across the board as a company, but we’re committed to change and hope we’ll make a small dent in improving the environment – through our products, services, partner choices and company best practices.”\n[re]think\nBlazing a path of innovation in making the products more sustainable, the new SimpleTech [re]drive is the most eco-friendly alternative on the market when compared to standard external hard drives. Renewable and recyclable materials are used in every aspect of the product where plausible and economically possible. For instance, it’s designed using bamboo, which is incredibly strong (16 percent harder than maple) and is one the earth’s most sustainable, environmentally-friendly natural resources. The bamboo is naturally grown local to Fabrik’s manufacturing facility so the material is not transported over long distances.\nA thick aluminum casing is used not only for durability, but because it’s the most recycled metal on the planet. It also acts as a heat sink, cooling the drive without the use of a fan, saving additional energy and noise. Add to that a low-power internal hard drive, an Energy Star power adapter, and a feature that automatically powers the drive on and off with your computer, and you’ve got a storage and backup solution that keeps your grid demands to a minimum. Total power savings could equal up to 90 percent when compared to traditional external drives* or the equivalent of reducing approximately 475 lbs of carbon dioxide emissions over the life of the drive**.\nIn addition, the [re]drive’s simplified, 100 percent recyclable package contains just the bare essentials to reduce waste – there’s no extra bags or inserts, and the backup software and user guide are saved digitally on the drive. For added convenience, the quick set up guide is printed on the inside of the box.\nAs standard industry practice, Fabrik ensures that all of its products adhere to stringent, regulatory compliance standards such as Grunpunkt, RoHS and WEEE.\n[re]store\nThe SimpleTech [re]drive is a reliable alternative for protecting precious data on a Mac or PC. A simple-to-use wizard guides you through a one-time set up process, where you can easily select what day, time, or specific files or folders you want protected. For PC users, virus protection is included to help prevent the transfer of infected files before the backup occurs. Free updates are continually made available to provide ongoing protection from the latest viruses. The backup software also lets you create a disaster recovery CD that can be used to boot your system in case of system failure, which could save hours of reinstalling the OS and various applications.\nWhile backing up your digital files to the [re]drive is important, Fabrik Ultimate Backup provides the ultimate online backup data protection, so no matter what sort of disaster strikes your external drive or computer – a spilled drink, theft, fire, or other natural disaster – your pics, flicks and tunes are safe. Each SimpleTech [re]drive comes with 2GB of free online backup space, or for less than $5 per month you get unlimited capacity to securely backup all of your important files and media collections offsite. All online backups are secure, encrypted and most importantly are unobtrusive; performing incremental backups, so only the smallest amount of content that has been changed or modified within your files will be updated. Fabrik Ultimate Backup is also available as a standalone online backup service.\nFabrik’s new SimpleTech [re]drives Turbo USB 2.0 external drives are available today at many U.S. retail store and online sites. Manufacturer’s suggested retail pricing (MSRP) is $159.99 for 500GB.\nAlong with the [re]drive, Fabrik also announced today the availability of the new SimpleTech SimpleDrive and a new 500GB Signature Mini Portable USB 2.0 Drive.

The startup ran a platform that allowed developers to build and distribute small software applications called widgets that could be dropped into consumer or enterprise websites. But the three-year-old San Francisco firm was nearly done in by the triple whammy of the recession (which meant there were few paying customers for widgets), Facebook (which had created its own massive market for embedded Web applications, sucking away software development talent), and Apple (which did the same on mobile devices). The company laid off half its staff, and spent the better part of a year searching for a new business model. “To be totally transparent, we had no idea what to do,” says CEO Will Price.\nThen, on July 21, 2009—coincidentally, the 40th anniversary of Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon—“I got an e-mail that changed the company,” Price says. The note was from Ryan Roslansky, the director of product management at LinkedIn. Roslansky explained that LinkedIn was planning to start showing display ads alongside its social-networking profiles. But it didn’t want to show standard banner ads—it wanted to offer advertisers a different type of ad unit, something that would be more customized, interactive, and engaging, and would therefore fetch higher rates. Such ads would need to function like mini-websites, but they’d have to be far faster, easier, and cheaper to create than traditional “rich media” ads. Roslansky’s suggestion: Widgetbox already had the technology to do this.\n“Ryan said, ‘If you don’t call these things widgets but call them banner ads, you guys are on the cutting edge of what ads are,'” says Price. “So we found ourselves in the display ad market.”\nFlite CEO Will Price\nIt was an epic pivot, and it saved the company. Today the startup is called Flite (it abandoned the Widgetbox name in March), and it’s got a long list of publishers, ad agencies, and brands, including LinkedIn, paying for what it calls its “cloud-based” advertising platform. The “cloud” part is really just the fashionable term these days for what Flite has been doing all along—that is, connecting a gallery of small applications with a back end of data and services. If you see a Web ad for HP, FedEx, or Toyota that has lots of clickable tabs, videos, forms, sliding images, and social sharing links, chances are the ad was authored on, and served up by, Flite’s platform.\nWidgetbox ran through $14 million in Series A and B funding before its stall. But with 65 employees and $12 million in new cash from General Catalyst, Sequoia Capital, and Hummer Winblad, Flite is airborne again. Its main challenge now, Price says, is the “behavior change issue.” Big brands that want nifty interactive ads are accustomed to paying big money to big advertising agencies, who put big creative teams on the case and take six weeks to build one ad. None of that is necessary with Flite’s ad-authoring platform, which makes assembling and staging a new ad as easy as clicking a few buttons. Indeed, the system is designed to be so easy to use that brands themselves can change the content of their ads every day, if they feel like it. “Any technology change that requires a behavior change has a risk,” as Price puts it. “But somebody is going to win this ability for brands to do their own programming.”\nOh, and Ryan Roslansky? His 2009 note and Price’s response was the purest possible example of a startup listening to a customer, even if it was driven by desperation. “I wanted to give him stock, but his general counsel wouldn’t let me,” says Price. Instead, Roslansky serves today on Flite’s “Customer Council,” a group of advisors from top publishers, agencies, and brands.\nFlite’s story starts even before widgets.

Is Peyton Manning going to play like he’s 25 years old again? Can Johnny Football live up to the hype?\nYou’ll also notice lots of new technology on the field this season, as the NFL highlighted on Wednesday in Seattle . Thanks to a  partnership it inked with Microsoft in May 2013, NFL players and coaches will be using Microsoft’s Surface tablet on the sidelines in between possessions. Meant to replace the traditional black-and-white printed papers, the device will provide photos of recent plays that help players and coaches figure out what was going on in previous possessions.\nSome players will also wear shoulder pads with RFID tags inside their shoulder pads, which will allow the NFL to record real-time position data and information related to acceleration, speed, routes, and total distance run.\nThere’s also neat technology off the field that fans can take advantage of, from apps to streaming game feeds to Twitter. We’ve rounded up some football-related tech tools and apps that may help bolster your NFL viewing experience this season.\nApps\nThe NFL Mobile app.\nThere are a number of NFL-related apps in the marketplace, and some are really worth pointing out. One is a new app from the NFL called  NFL Now , which is largely a video hub for all things NFL. Available as a free or paid app, NFL Now features instant highlights, behind-the-scenes content, historic NFL Films footage, and much more.\n“There’s never been a deeper opportunity for you to get into our content and to our video, and to experience it the way you want to experience it, the way you want to do it, when you want to do it, and on whatever platform you’re on,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said at an event in Seattle on Wednesday. “We’re excited about that.”\nThe NFL also has NFL Mobile , which is great for catching up on the latest highlights, news, statistics, and standings. ESPN ScoreCenter is also another good one for keeping up with scores and news. In addition, Microsoft has a nice NFL App for the Xbox One and Windows 8. Other favorites include Bleacher Report’s Team Stream , Fanzo , Yahoo Sports , and Fox Sports Mobile .\nFor the fantasy football players,  ESPN ,  Yahoo ,  NFL.com , and CBSSports.com offer solid apps that allow users to fine-tine their rosters and check the latest stats.\nStreaming games\nNFL Sunday TIcket.\nIf you don’t have access to a TV but can get online, there are a handful of ways to watch NFL games.\nIf you’re willing to pony up some dollars, NFL Sunday Ticket is your best option. For $330, the DirectTV program lets you stream every out-of-market game to your mobile devices.\nThen there’s Verizon, which is now allowing its “More Everything” customers to watch live NFL games  from their mobile devices without paying a $5 per month fee that was removed this year. Verizon’s  NFL Mobile  also features access to the NFL Network.\nMeanwhile, FOX announced  on Wednesday that it will stream 101 games — 97 in the regular season, four in the playoffs — this year via its Fox Sports Go app . However, viewers will need a cable subscription to certain cable services and games will also be restricted to those that are in your market. Fans will also not be able to stream games on mobile phones due to league restrictions, but laptops and tablets are good to go.\nNBC livestreams its Sunday Night games.\nEvery Sunday night, NBC will be streaming its weekly game online for free and does not require a cable subscription. You can check out that feed here .\nFor Monday Night Football, fans can view the ESPN stream here , but will need a cable subscription.\nIf you happen to miss a live broadcast, the NFL has a way to stream already-played games with its Game Rewind program. It’ll cost you $70 to stream each game this season — including playoffs and the Super Bowl — or you can pay $30 for access to just one team’s replays.\nThere are a few other options, particularly for those that don’t have cable. You can try something like Aereo , which charges a small fee to stream live TV.\nFinally, there’s NFL Game Pass , which lets viewers from outside the U.S. and Canada stream every game in exchange for a subscription fee. Although a bit risky, you can try using a VPN  to make it appear like you’re not in the U.S. or Canada. Some popular VPNs include  Hola ,  TunnelBear , or Cloak  to get around the block. But if you’re going to pay for a streaming service, I’d recommend just going with Sunday Ticket.\nTwitter lists\nTwitter lists are a great way to follow a pre-selected group of Twitter accounts, and may become more popular with Twitter possibly curating user timelines in the near future.\nFor example, ESPN has a decent NFL-specific list here . If you’re interested in the Seahawks, I put together this list here  that should keep you up-to-date with everything related to the defending Super Bowl champs. You can also create your own Twitter lists tailored to your specific NFL interests. Head to your Lists page to create a new group.\nEarlier this week, Sporting News compiled a nice “must-follow on Twitter” group here , and Mashable did something similar here . Bleacher Report also has a good round-up of NFL sportswriters to follow here .\nBuying tickets\nThere’s nothing like actually being at an NFL game and fans have a number of resources online to find good deals on tickets — particularly if you’re willing to wait until the last second to purchase. There are the popular ones — NFL Ticket Exchange , StubHub, Craigslist — but lesser-known options include  SeatGeek ,  Vivid Seats , Cheap Tickets , RazorGator , and TickPick .\nIn addition, there are newer apps like Rukkus and Gametime  where you may find a sweet deal.\nLove tech and sports?  Sign up for our GeekWire Sports email newsletter for ongoing coverage of the innovations transforming the world of sports. And make sure to join us on July 12-13 for the inaugural GeekWire Sports Tech Summit .

With Publicator, you start with a PDF and you end up with a richer, more engaging version of that PDF online. It still looks like the printed version.\nSramana Mitra: Where would we find a good example of this. Does Ethan Allen have live examples?\nBrian Rigney: It does. Let me find one for you. Go to the Ethan Allen website and you’ll see catalogs at the bottom of the page.\nSramana Mitra: Catalogs, okay.\nBrian Rigney: Artworks and Mirrors is our product.\nSramana Mitra: I see.\nBrian Rigney: They use this to showcase their products online as well as inside the store. Inside their store, they have touchscreens that allow visitors to explore. It’s great for engagement.\nSramana Mitra: What does the competitive landscape look like for what you do in terms of enriching the content for retailers? Who else is in this business?\nBrian Rigney: You’ve got larger organisations like Adobe. We frankly have not run into anyone who directly competes with us. We fill a gap between e-commerce systems and content management systems. I’ll give you an example. If you go to the New York & Company website, and in the Trends section on the top left, go to the All About Eva section.\nCreator has allowed them to create this initial image of Eva Mendes with a plus sign to the right of her hand, which means that you can shop for that look. Creator allows New York and Company to very quickly and easily create these very rich and engaging experiences. It’s shoppable content.\nSramana Mitra: You’re saying that the catalog vendors are not providing this level of richness in the content experience.\nBrian Rigney: The e-commerce players do not, nor do the content management systems. Here’s why. If we were to go to the Neiman Marcus website and click on the Designers tab on the top left. Now, click on Alice + Olivia, and then click on Apparel on the left-hand side. You will see  a slider with different looks .\nHere’s the gap. There are large enterprise systems like Adobe, Oracle, or SAP that have flaws. In the case of Creator, we’re taking advantage of one of those flaws. Neiman Marcus, where you now see a slider, used to have only one image. That image could only have one link to it. If you click on the link, it took you to a product page or it took you down to a grid. The effort is beautiful of course, but it’s not a very engaging shopping experience.\nNow if in the slider on the third slide, you’ll see woman in red sleeveless top and white bell bottom pants. Click on that plus sign and you can shop the look. It’s very easy to do. We’ve created this solution for both large retailers as well as small ones.\n", "deleted" : false }

RNTS Media will pay $20 million in cash upfront, with an additional $25 million in cash and shares available down the line if Heyzap hits performance targets by 2017.\nThe move comes roughly nine months after Fyber spent around $11 million on German SSP and ad server Falk Realtime in April.\nRNTS, a publicly traded company on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, first signaled its intention to acquire Heyzap on behalf of Fyber in late December. Fyber became an independent subsidiary of RNTS in October 2014 as part of a $190 million deal.\nUntil this point, Fyber and Heyzap were direct competitors in the fight to win publisher contracts for mobile ad monetization.\nThat wasn’t always the case. Heyzap started life in 2009 focused more on social app discovery than monetization. Back then, Heyzap and Fyber (before it rebranded from SponsorPay ), were partners. More recently, Heyzap got into the mobile advertising space and the two started butting heads.\n“We’d been competing with Fyber very seriously for the last year or so,” said Heyzap co-founder Jude Gomila.\nBut it soon became apparent that they could be better together, said Janis Zech, COO and co-founder of Fyber.\n“Sometimes when you compete, you realize that you actually have a shared mission, and for both of us that means helping publishers integrate, manage and optimize their ad revenue in one solution,” Zech said.\nThe Heyzap acquisition is part of Fyber’s larger plan to improve its “stickiness with existing publisher clients,” said RNTS CEO and Fyber co-founder Andreas Bodczek.\nBut the remaining competition is fierce. The mobile monetization landscape is populated by the likes of MoPub, Smaato, AdMob and Rubicon, to name a few.\nWhich is a large part of the reason why RNTS raised a 100 million euro bond (around US$112 million) in August, earmarked mainly for acquisitions.\n“We’re interested in serving all sorts of different publishers with a single unified point of integration to service their various advertising needs,” Zech said.\nFyber’s stack already includes ad network mediation, access to rewarded and nonrewarded ad units, user segmentation, analytics and optimization. The Falk buy was about programmatic and RTB – the Falk ad server is being integrated directly into Fyber’s RTB exchange, a process Bodczek expects to be complete within the next six months – while Heyzap will help bolster mediation, cross-promotion and user acquisition.\nAnother factor behind the Heyzap acquisition: scale. Heyzap’s 130 million monthly active users boosts Fyber’s to 541 million. Heyzap also brings along relationships with approximately 5,000 publishers, app developers and brands, including CBS, King, Gameloft, Machine Zone, Mattel and Hipster Whale, maker of Crossy Road.\nAll of Heyzap’s 21 employees are expected to join the Fyber team, swelling the company’s ranks to just over 300 – and they don’t have to travel far to their new digs. Heyzap’s office is located down the street from Fyber’s San Francisco outpost. Heyzap’s co-founder Gomila will stay on board to head up sales.\nPrior to the acquisition, Heyzap had raised $8 million in five rounds, the most recent of which was a $4.3 million Series B in December 2012, led by Qualcomm Ventures and Union Square Ventures.\n", "deleted" : false }

So far in November, online sales are 4 percent less than last year. Online retailers Amazon and eBay will be fighting for every last Christmas dollar.\nThe two look more and more alike these days, as eBay seeks growth beyond the mom-and-pop auction sellers that everyone associates with the site. The company has been emphasizing fixed-price listings for a while now. But earlier this week it took another step towards wooing the types of merchants that you are still more likely to find on Amazon. On Monday, eBay quietly announced a new program in beta that will allow large merchants to list thousands of fixed-price items at once on the site.\nThis will no doubt give eBay’s core mom-and-pop auction sellers one more thing to complain about (like they need more competition from larger outfits). But what else can eBay do? Its main source of growth comes from its non-retail businesses like Skype. Its $945 million Bill Me Later acquisition is now looking suspect . And its overall ability to attract consumers has stagnated. According to comScore, eBay had 70.7 million unique U.S. visitors in October, down 11 percent from the year before. In contrast, Amazon had 60.1 million unique U.S. visitors in October, up 6 percent (see chart above).\nThe reality is that any merchant selling online will list their items for sale in multiple locations—on Amazon, eBay, their own Websites, etc. (Multi-channel e-commerce management service Mercent, for example, is already supporting eBay’s API for its online retail customers).\nNow, with this new API we might see some interesting mixing and matching. An online retailer, for instance, can now list her items on eBay and use Amazon’s fulfillment API to ship the orders from an Amazon warehouse.\nDon’t underestimate the importance of these APIs in the battle to dominate e-commerce. Whoever controls the flow of transaction information, will control the flow of goods online.\n", "deleted" : false }

Presenters included Act-On Software , Magento , Mumboe , and NetBooks . While all presenters emphasized their company's ability to offer software as a service, Magento and NetBooks especially focused on tools for small business.\nThe Cisco-funded Act-On Software combines Salesforce.com's leads database with WebEx's large-scale conferencing to add invitation and follow-up services and pull data between the two. For example, Act-On runs as a tab within Salesfoce, WebEx, and Microsoft applications, and can show Salesforce data after a WebEx conference. Act-on will manage the invitation to promote a webinar, track attendance, and offer follow-up analysis on a given WebEx webinar.\nMagento, an open source eCommerce application, lets clients build online stores to their specifications and even manage multiple stores and retail types from a single administrative interface. Magento also offers promotional tools in addition to SEO support and catalog management. What's different in the market is the open-source aspect, so far unique to Magento.\nMagento plans to introduce several more product tiers, including enterprise products for small and medium businesses, professional services, and Magento on-demand, positioned as a software service. It will launch within the next 10 days for users in 20 languages.\nMumboe's on-demand software helps small and medium businesses create, store, manage, and track sensitive legal documents--leases, NDAs, contracts, and so on securely on Mumboe's site. Collaboration is the main feature here, allowing users to download templates, edit documents, and share. Mumboe, which launched on Monday, also integrates iCal feeds and Microsoft Outlook, harnessing its reminder notification system. A Microsoft Word plug-in is planned to release in two weeks.\nMumboe aims its light-to-midweight Web application at corporate consumers, and starts at the reasonable fee of $24 per user per month. CEO Bill Kane tackled the question of competitors as collaborators and complements, including Zoho and Microsoft Live services.\nFounded by Ridgely Evers, the person who defined specifications for Intuit's QuickBooks, and a compelling speaker, NetBooks is positioned as a tool for the small business owner. The Web application draws marketing, sales, operations, and finance management tools into a single, simple system designed to be accessible to everyday users. Keeping the tools in the cloud lets users access data remotely.\nTheir plan of success going forward fiercely relies on big-name partnerships, which NetBooks expects to announce in the near future. Judges questioned the $200 pricing model and how NetBooks would compete with QuickBooks, which will not be integrated into the product.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

In addition to supporting more contemporary features right now, and getting updated with even newer gadgets more frequently than Microsoft can muster, these products, being completely Web-based, offer much more robust collaboration tools.\nFirst up: Liquid Planner . We saw this product at Demo 2008 but it will be on stage again at the Under the Radar conference that I'm moderating on Thursday. This tool's special sauce is its embrace of uncertainty. Users can put in best-case and worst-case estimates for their tasks, and the product combines all the estimates to tell you how likely you are to make deadlines, and also which sub-tasks are the most critical to achieving project goals.\nThen there's Clarizen , the 2.0 version of which comes out this week. This product has a very nice, very Web 2.0 user interface, but what I like best about it that most users will never see the UI: managers can set up projects on the Clarizen site, but people responsible for delivering on those projects never have to use it. The product sends e-mail queries that users can update directly, bypassing the main site and the $50 monthly per-user fee as well.\nFinally, there's the specialized Mumboe , which we'll also see at Under the Radar. This is a Web-based \"CLM\" (contract lifecycle management) app, but it's apparently one of the first to have a completely free subscription tier. The tool tracks the documents that go into a business agreement, and lets you specify start and end dates, deliverables, commitments, and tracking metrics. You can delegate tasks, of course, and also see your entire list of deliverables and commitments on one dashboard screen. Mumboe will also be at Under the Radar.\nJoin me at Under the Radar!\nI stink at project management and can't offer an expert opinion on these products, but I do think that if you are a project management software user, you might want to try one of these Web-based tools. Of course, don't forget to also check out Basecamp .\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

It's in the heads of the community.\"\nFor the new release, version 2.0, Jitterbit placed particular emphasis on the user interface, creating a new visual, drag-and-drop workflow designer for creating and testing integrations.\nThe release also introduces parallel processing for moving larger amounts of data. For example, an IT shop might want to load 100,000 leads into Salesforce.com from a campaign management system, but Salesforce places a limit on the number of records that can be delivered in a single transmission, according to CTO Ilan Sehayek.\nJitterbit can now \"chunk\" the data into multiple concurrent calls. \"Salesforce can handle many calls, it just doesn't want them to be large,\" Sehayek said.\nRelated\n1200+ IT Security Pros Share Cloud Strategy\nOther open-source data integration vendors include Talend , XAware and SnapLogic , which also has a community site and is building a library of completed connectors and pipelines.\n\"The integration problem is a really terrific candidate for open source, not only from the development side but the business perspective,\" said SnapLogic CEO Chris Marino. That's because data integration today requires connectivity with a wide range of sources, and it is too expensive to rely on a vendor or integrator to provide every connection, he said.\nSnapLogic offers a free community edition under the GPL v2 open-source license, as well as commercial versions. But it is not attempting to compete with major proprietary players like Informatica, which was co-founded by SnapLogic's chairman Gaurav Dhillon, he said.\nInformatica makes software that has \"been tuned mightily to move vast amounts of data, to do all the things people need to do to build data warehouses for [business intelligence],\" Marino said. SnapLogic has instead \"focused on the problem of integrating on the web.\"\nTo that end, these vendors don't necessarily pose an immediate threat to established players, but are finding a niche, according to one industry observer.\n\"I see a lot more open source data integration vendors than customers today, but do believe these tools can offer add value for certain types of customers,\" said Rob Karel, an analyst with Forrester Research, via e-mail.\nThe tools are best suited for \"midmarket companies with less complex requirements and smaller budgets, or departmental or project-based initiatives within larger enterprises,\" he said.\nNASA's Integrated Services Environment (NISE) is using Jitterbit to handle data integration needs in its identity management infrastructure, pushing information from sources like human resources systems to enterprise directories, said project manager Sharon Ing. \"It's all about ID management and provisioning of credentials.\"\nIng's group manages about 150,000 identities. Officials tested systems from large vendors before settling on Jitterbit, she said.\nThe tool is easy to use - albeit for technically savvy people - and its \"cost was certainly attractive to us,\" she said.\n", "deleted" : false }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5725f9c3cbaf4c0001a6e919" }, "companyIDs" : [ "x-aware" ], "title" : "The Long Tail of Services", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-04-28T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "URL" : "http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-long-tail-of-services/", "content" : "| Topic: Enterprise Software\nCommentary--The \"Long Tail\" moniker has been used extensively (some would say overused) in marketing and mass media over the last couple years. Now, as different use cases for SOA evolve, the metaphor seems appropriate to explain the growing use of services outside of the core domains of SOA, business process implementation and integration.\nFirst, let’s take a step back. The term “long tail,” coined by Wired Editor Chris Anderson, is used to describe how companies like Amazon, iTunes, and Netflix have monetized the huge number of low-volume products they carry in inventory. While traditional retailers make most of their money selling only the blockbusters, these companies have discovered how to make significant money from the products that sell in very small quantities. In “The Long Tail” diagram below, the green area (the head) represents the “blockbusters”, a small number of high volumes sales items.\nThe yellow area is the tail, representing a large number of items selling at very low volume. You can imagine that if the tail is long enough, its revenue is significant, and can even exceed that of the head.\nThe Long Tail\nThe Long Tail of Services\nThe phenomenon of minimalist services created for singular purposes won’t subside anytime soon. In fact, single-use and low reuse services, common in Web 2.0 applications, may outnumber those designed for reuse. Does that make minimalist services less valuable than those that may be reused? Not at all.\nAs Web 2.0 and SOA evolve, the Long Tail metaphor is appropriate because it helps justify the phenomenon of minimalist services created for singular purposes. While the SOA mantra is to create services for reuse, the rise of Web 2.0 technologies like AJAX and Flex has created a different niche for the development of services, resulting in a style of service that is not very service oriented.\nIn “The Long Tail of Services” diagram, the horizontal axis represents individual services, and the vertical axis shows “instances of use”. The head area represents services that are reused many times. The tail area shows services with ever decreasing reuse, culminating with services used only a single time (single-use services).\nThe Long Tail of Services. Single-use and low reuse services may outnumber those designed for reuse.\nServices for Web 2.0 Applications\nBuilding services for consumption in a user-facing application (Web 2.0) is quite different than building services to feed core business processes (SOA). If you download and use any of the AJAX-like environments, or Adobe’s Flex, and build a sample display fed from XML data, you’ll likely notice the XML structure tends to follow a simple, almost table-like structure. This is very simplistic compared to the information-rich XML structure you might expect in real-world business objects like a purchase order, invoice, or insurance policy. The latter are the domain of SOA proper, the subjects manipulated by services while moving through business processes.\nAt first glance, I would say the Web 2.0 style services are high-quantity, commoditized, point services fulfilling a specific, singular purpose. Don’t expect reuse from these, as they were not designed with reuse as design criteria. But thinking further about this, I now feel that a small service like this may actually be a good candidate for reuse. The reason: its visualization is the main manifestation of its existence. In fact, a user who sees the visualization of the information is probably going to be the one to recognize that it can be used in other situations. Isn’t this a much more powerful reuse driver than a UDDI query, or worse, a WSDL file sitting on a web server or file system somewhere? Even with a nice WSDL viewer, it takes imagination to envision the data reused in another application. If this visualization aspect does turn out to be a big factor in reuse, perhaps that will drive a movement to publish services with default visualization components. It sure makes sense to be able to visualize a data structure in a display composition, rather than simply viewing an XML structure.\nOther Aspects of The Long Tail of Services\nThe Long Tail of Services diagram is also a good context to help rationalize other aspects of service oriented design. I can envision where on the graph you would expect to apply the most governance energy (services whose intent is high reuse), and where you might expect to use light-weight REST or POX rather than SOAP as a delivery mechanism (in the long tail). Debates such as REST versus WS-* are still simmering, but The Long Tail of Services may at least provide a different dimension on the discussion, providing a context where one point of view makes more sense relative to one section of the curve.\nCredits: The Long Tail picture was created by Hay Kranen/PD, and annotated by me.\nbiography\nKirstan Vandersluis founded XAware, Inc. in 1999.

Yes, that'll work.\nPosted\nWeekend Project: Turn all your fruit into shot glasses with the ShotCarver\nLast year yet another ‘build your own social network’ appeared. SocialGO was a white-label social networking site creator spun out of UK company Bright Things . SocialGO lets you create an online community website which is either stand-alone or inside an existing website. All the usual features like IM, content-sharing for photos and videos, blogging tools etc are there.\nClearly things may not have gone to plan though. There are any number of these companies. Let me see now (deep breath) Ning, PeopleAggregator, SocialSpring, OneSite, GoingOn, CrowdVine, Mzinga, Haystack, CollectiveX, Moli, KickApps, DZOIC, Pringo, SmallWorldLabs and in the UK, WebJam and Kwiqq. And all of them arrived well before SocialGO. Ning of course has Marc Andreessen as Chairman and well over 100 million dollars in funding.\nSo what’s the answer? What can be user-generated virtually for free, is in high demand and creates a lot of traffic? Yes! Porn!\nThus, Zocku.com , a white label social networking platform dedicated to adult networks which has SocialGO as its underlying platform, has been money-shot into existence.\nApparently there are already plenty of customers with one “generating in excess of $5,000 a month in ad revenue and membership fees.” One client says Zocku.com “has created a more complete and satisfying experience for Ruffkin’s members.” I’m sure it has.\nIn other words, it may well be the case that SocialGO launched and then found itself inundated with porn merchants, as happened to Ning – something which nearly destroyed the company until it banned them.\nThe question only remains. How Bright did Bright Things have to be to dream this move up? The words “not” and “very” spring to mind.\n0\nTechCrunch Daily Our top headlines Delivered daily\nTC Week-in-Review Top stories of the week Delivered weekly\nCrunchBase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Delivered daily\nTC Europe The top European tech stories Delivered weekly\nTC Gadgets Top stories about gadgets Delivered weekly\nTC Mobile & Apps Top stories about apps Delivered weekly\nTC Startups Top stories about startups Delivered weekly\nTC Social Media Top stories about social Delivered weekly\nTC Asia The top Asian tech stories Delivered weekly\nCrunch Network The best from our contributors Delivered weekly\n| Natasha Lomas\nhttp://blog.taragana.com/ Angsuman Chakraborty\nWhy is it so surprising that social networking has come to porn.

Ning provided a free service and this company is charging for it, I’m sure there are plenty of adult performers who would pay for a hosted solution like this to serve their fans and collect membership fees from them.\nhttp://uk.techcrunch.com Mike Butcher\nI’m saying that any dumbo can create a platform for porn and make money. What clearly almost certainly happened was that SocialGo was a flop so they’ve switch the platform into the adult market. Fine. They’ll make money and so will their users. But it’s still a climbdown.\nDuh\nWhat are you on about?\nPorn is a highly professional, competitive business. Most porn sites are way more advanced than the average start-up. It’s a valid, multi-million dollar/euro/pound business, with a very wide audience. How the f*** is this a climbdown?\nI’ve seen this kind of moralistic crap before from Techcrunch “omg, hookers!” US. Wasn’t expecting it from you, but apparently Techcrunch systematically selects it’s bloggers on puritanical prejudices.\nCarl M\nMike – You say “What clearly almost certainly happened was that SocialGo was a flop so they’ve switch the platform into the adult market. Fine. They’ll make money and so will their users. But it’s still a climbdown.”\nOk – I guess you have some insight that I do not. I guess that you know how many networks they have, what % are paying for the SocialGO premium services and if you have a handle on their cash burn that would be great too…\nIf not, please don’t be so forceful in your comments because people less perceptive than I may take your comments more seriously than they should!\nI think that what clearly almost certainly happened is that you did not know how SocialGO were getting on, you saw the zocku product and were short of something to wright about…the rest is history…\nI’m being serious about that insight by the way, if you know thier costs and can have an informed stab at their income then I will concede that you are able to talk about what has and hasn’t flopped…\nSpeaking of flops, I read that Ning is now worth $750M…Hang on an minute….\nNetworks – 1M+ …. Check\nPremium subscribers – 12k (down from 15k…hmmm) …. Check\nRevenue – circa $1M per month … Check\nCosts – circa $3M per month … hmmm, ok, check\nValuation – $750M … wtf, are you tacking the p..s?! lol\nObjective Observer\nSo, let me check my understanding of your logic Mike:\nIn today’s difficult economic climate, a publicly traded company comes along and delivers a solution “out of the blue” that solves the problem held by literally thousands of adult site owners who were turned away by Ning, and allows them to make roughly $60k a year or more doing so. In the process, this company is able to generate premium membership fees from these customers who previously were giving their money to a VC funded company, Ning.\nDid I get your story correct?\nIf so, then I ask you to puhleaaaase explain to me why we should not all be flocking to SocialGO and the guys who helped them develop a solution so quickly. Because, unlike Twitter and all the rest of the non-profitable companies you gush over daily on TechCrunch, it seems that SocialGO/Zocku has made it possible for people to make more money running their own personal porn site than you do as a “writer” for TechCrunch?\nAs far as I understand, SocialGO is not only doing just as well with mainstream Network Creators, but is now better off than ever because Ning has screwed over their Network Creators (once again) and virtually ensured that everyone is flocking to SocialGO.\nhttp://www.chartingstocks.net/2009/03/ning-exposed-tech-company-ning-scams-its-clients/\nIt seems that this little bit of news was purposefully not covered by TechCrunch because Mr. Arrington has made it his personal job to defend all things Ning. The tone of your article, in the face of the objective facts, is further proof of his “agenda”.\nWould the appearance of Mr. Andreessen at TC50, or Mr. Arrington’s frequent calls and lunches with Ms. Bianchini have anything to do with such biased reporting on your part?\nhttp://uk.techcrunch.com Mike Butcher\nYeah and there was no moon landing either, right? Your conspiracy theory might work if TechCrunch Europe was run by Mike Arrington, but it’s not. TC Europe is part of the network of TC sites. I don’t even know who this Bianchini person is.\nLook – Ning pissed of pornsters. Pornsters are flocking to Zocku? Is that what you think? Then fine, have it your way. All I’m saying is that Zocku is evidence that SocialGO failed as a concept ad made *so much* money for Bright Things they simply had to go and create a porn platform because that’s the only way they were going to get any return. That’s a fail in my book.\nObjective Observer\nWow, so what you’re saying Mike is that a company is a “fail” because at some point in time (that you select arbitrarily) they are making money for a significant group of customers who have cash to spend?\nIs this true even if SocialGO is not only growing, but growing exponentially? Will this brilliant bit of logic on your part be true if SocialGO is found to be generating net profit at the same time as Bright Things is also making money on Zocku?\nUsing your logic Mike, a company is a “fail” because they actually satisfy the needs of their customers and make a profit in the process. This is actually appropriate for someone who writes for Tech Crunch (Europe or otherwise) because it demonstrates why the Venture Capital game is completely in the toilet.\nSo called “journalists” such as yourself pump up the value of companies that take millions in VC money to accomplish what could be done using regular old-fashioned business sense. Remember the idea of a business Mike? It’s called making something that your customers want to pay you to have.\nOh yeah, you’re the Tech Crunch “journalist” who supposedly claims to not even know who Gina Bianchini is. Give me a break. How about Prince Charles, ever hear of him?\nhttp://uk.techcrunch.com Mike Butcher\nYour personal attacks are very dull and show scant wit. I’d be more impressed if you put your real name to your views but no. Bon chance mon amis.\nEd Johnson\n” All I’m saying is that Zocku is evidence that SocialGO failed as a concept ad made *so much* money for Bright Things they simply had to go and create a porn platform because that’s the only way they were going to get any return. That’s a fail in my book.”\nOh come now.. If SocialGO changed their focus to a differnet topic.. say, Video Games, Science/Technology, Home and Gardening, Cooking, etc.. would it still be a fail?\nIt seems to me that they were trying to be over-arching with their “Sell ANY kind of Social Network!” platform, which wasn’t working (with free social networks coming out of the wazooo) so they responded to the will of the market. Good for them!\nhttp://jackthorogood.com Jack\nGood for SocialGo. Looks like they’ve got a strong revenue stream that’ll probably help them become profitable quite quickly.\nSocNets are a good way for adult performers to build and maintain a following and – regardless of your moral qualms – the actual performer building value as a brand has got to put them in a stronger position vis-a-vis the proverbial pimps, which must be a good thing?\nEX_NINGER\nLOL TC WONT COVER A STORY UNLESS ITS DIRECTLY OUT OF THE CORPORATIONS PRESS RELEASE.\nNING IS BLOWING UP AND TC HAS BEEN CURIOUSLY ABSENT IN REPORTING IT\nEX_NINGER\nin case you’d like to find a story worth writing about\nninging\ntech crunch, no disrespect but here are a few links from ning.com’s own site to help you guys out\n", "deleted" : false }

In case you’re tired of waiting for an invite and desperately need to start using Inbox, there’s a way to force Inbox access on your mobile device, as discovered by WonderHowTo .\nFROM EARLIER: This free app is a fantastic alternative to Google’s game-changing email app ‘Inbox’\nIn order for it to work, you still need access to a friend who has an Inbox account. Sure, in such a case said friend could send you an Inbox invite to make things even easier, but if he or she is out of invites, that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck.\nWhat you have to do is have you friend sign into his or her Google account on a smartphone after installing Inbox for iOS or Android on it. Then, you’ll also have to sign into your Google account on the same device.\nThen, your friend has to log into the Inbox app where he or she can associate your Google account to his or her account. Once that’s done, you’ll be able to log into Inbox on your own smartphone, and your friend can remove your Google account from his or her smartphone. However, even though you’re now able to use the new email service, you won’t be able to use the same trick to sneak more of your friends into Inbox.\nThe full instructions are available at the source link.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

The acquisition, which is expected to be announced soon, marks a bit of an inglorious exit for GetGlue, which had raised $24 million since being founded and had an earlier deal worth $70 million fall through earlier this year.\nGetGlue, of course, was one of the early social TV pioneers, promising to help drive mobile and tablet users to tune in to more TV shows and get them more engaged with the content through its app. The idea was that people were already on their phones while they watched TV, so why not try to hook them on a new, TV-based social network?\nLeveraging Foursquare-like check-ins to TV shows, the app helped users share what they were watching, hopefully driving others to watch that same thing as well. Later, as the hype around TV check-ins began to wane, GetGlue pivoted to be more of a TV discovery platform .\nLast year, GetGlue had agree to be acquired by social TV competitor Viggle , a company buoyed by billionaire investor and chairman Robert Sillerman . But that deal hinged on Viggle being able to secure additional funding from outside investors , and when that funding failed to materialize, the deal was called off .\nSince then, GetGlue has apparently continued shopping itself around. It’s also shuffled management while looking for a buyer — over the summer it brought on digital media veteran Evan Krauss as president . And sometime between then and now founder and CEO Alex Iskold stepped down. He still remains chairman of the company, but sources say he’s not involved in day-to-day operations.\nYou probably know less about i.TV, a company which has also been around for about five years and was also founded with the hope of connecting mobile and tablet users with TV and streaming content they might find interesting.\nAfter launching in 2008 to give video viewers with a mobile platform for finding and discovering interesting content , i.TV has been relatively quiet over the last several years. It had launched a few versions of an app that provided ways to browse and get more info about streaming video options, as well as a remote control to power navigating traditional TV offerings.\nBut behind the scenes, it seems to be working with various content providers — including Entertainment Weekly, as well as AOL-owned properties like Huffington Post TV and AOL TV — to power navigation and discovery of videos on their apps. A little more than a year ago, it got its biggest deal yet, as it powered video discovery for Nintendo’s Wii U (a device I don’t think anyone actually bought).\nThe company also has quietly raised some capital. In August, i.TV closed a $9.2 million round of funding, according to an SEC filing . But that funding isn’t going toward the purchase of GetGlue, as we’ve heard that the acquisition was an all-stock deal.\nIt’s not clear how the newly funded i.TV will use the GetGlue assets, or who will end up joining the company — if anyone. But this isn’t the first bit of consolidation among social TV, second-screen, or TV check-in apps. In January, Dijit Media, the company behind the NextGuide TV discovery app,  acquired the assets of social TV startup Miso .\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

I’ve seen a ton of TV check-in apps in the last few months, so I asked founder and chief executive Alex Iskold how GetGlue (that’s the name of the app) will stand out.\nThe key, Iskold said, is that GetGlue is a platform. Yes, there’s a check-in app that users can download for their iPhone and iPad, but media companies can also add GetGlue’s check-in technology to their own apps, and they can add GetGlue widgets to their websites and Facebook Pages. A network could add a widget to a TV show website, and fans could then use a widget to say, “I’m watching Doctor Who,” which could then be shared on Facebook, Twitter, and within the GetGlue app itself.\nIskold added:\nThe fact is that every major media company already has iPhone and iPad apps — this is because these apps offer unique way to engage with fans, bring them unique content and rewards. Adding check-ins to these apps makes a lot of sense, because you want to know that they user is engaged and watching.\nThe API goes beyond widgets and exposes full control of GetGlue stack. Partners can tap into specific stickers, for example, displaying all rewards from their show inside their apps or web site. Also, partners can tap into personalized suggestions and user profile (all permission based using OAuth).\nThat’s a different approach than competitors like Miso and Philo , which seem more focused on their own apps.\nThe platform has already been used by USA, Showtime, and Discovery, Iskold said, and he plans to expand its usage among GetGlue’s other partners, which include more than “three dozen top entertainment brands.”\nGetGlue isn’t limited to TV check ins either — Iskold said TV is the biggest part of the app, but users can also check in to content like movies, music, and books. When I talked to Philo chief executive David Levy in July, he touted the company’s focus on TV, but Iskold argued that it’s important to be more complete.\n“Without other bits, the experience is too narrow,” he said. “TV check-ins are evening only, but during the day people listen to music, on the weekends people head to movies, play video games and read books.”\nAI.

GetGlue is walking away with a $500,000 break-up check.\n@jbruin\nOblivious Dude/Flickr\nThere could be some trouble in social TV land. Viggle and GetGlue, two competing companion mobile applications for television viewers, announced they have terminated their agreement to merge.\nViggle, a TV loyalty platform that automatically identifies the shows people are watching, said in November that it would acquire TV guide and manual checkin app GetGlue for $25 million and 48.3 million shares. The split is being described as cordial by both sides.\n\"During the time we started talking to GetGlue about an acquisition and since the merger agreement was signed in November, we have seen impressive growth in our business,\" Viggle Chief Executive Robert F.X. Sillerman said in a statement today. \"We wish GetGlue and [founder] Alex [Iskold] all the best.\"\nViggle said it verified nearly 870,000 audio check-ins on January 13, marking its single busiest day to date.\nSillerman's statement and the interestingly timed checkin announcement imply that Viggle's 1-year-old business, which rewards television viewers with points for watching shows, will do just fine without the help of its bigger, older one-time friend. GetGlue has more than 3.5 million registered users. Viggle has 1.62 million members, up 400,000 from the time the deal was announced.\nWhen reached for comment, GetGlue's Iskold declined to provide a statement on the dissolution of the deal to CNET. \"We are moving forward as an independent company, and all of us at GetGlue are excited about growing our social network and the leadership position on the second screen,\" he wrote in a blog post .\nOne possible explanation for the cessation could have to do with money troubles at Viggle. The company said in November that it was raising up to $60 million in convertible debt financing to fund the GetGlue buy, but that doesn't appear to have taken place. Instead, on January 10, Viggle's board approved an increase to the company's line of credit to $20 million from $15 million, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The line of credit had already been raised to $15 million from $12 million in the previous month.\nGetGlue, the product of AdaptiveBlue, will be getting a small break-up fee of $500,000, CNET has confirmed. The termination fee was a condition of the deal, as documented in Viggle's filing with the SEC:\nThe Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both Viggle and AdaptiveBlue and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including Viggle's failure to obtain financing as described above, Viggle will be obligated to reimburse AdaptiveBlue up to $500,000 for its costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of and performance of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

Their widget, like Jangl’s , provides users with an anonymous number to call each other with the added bonus of cheaper long distance calling.\nUp until now, Jaxtr users found each other more or less randomly on social networks of email signatures that listed links to the service. Jaxtr Cafe, however, is a social network of sorts where some 10 million users (50-60% active) of the service can find each other and carry on conversations about whatever they want. It also gives Jaxtr the opportunity to start monetizing their free service through advertising on the site. Jangl, on the other hand, has monetized on a case by case basis (rev share on Match.com, ads on PlentyOfFish).\nEvery user of Jaxtr is grandfathered in to Jaxtr Cafe’s profile database. You can search amongst these profiles based on interests and geography. For instance, if you want to talk to someone who’s an Australian and interested in food, you can easily do a search through the directory for just the right person. You can then call or text them using Jaxtr’s widget.\nI was surprised no to see an offering closer to Ingenio’s Ether, but that may be an additional feature in the coming months. Rather the service seems a lot like Skype Live. However there’s the added advantage that while people aren’t always on Skype, but pretty much always have their phones. It does come at the cost of your local calling minutes, but you’ll wind up with a cheaper long distance chat.\n", "deleted" : false }

Previously, it had been out in\nlimited beta since\nlast October . It remains unclear whether using the tool would be considered\ncloaking , which is against Google’s webmaster guidelines. The\nCloaking & Detection article from Stephan Spencer here on Search Engine Land\nlooked at this issue last month. Threadwatch has a\ngoing. I’ll explain more about the situation below, and I’m checking with Google\nfor the official word.\nFair to say, Google’s probably going to say that using the tool is NOT\ncloaking. Otherwise, you’ve got one part of Google putting out a tool that will\ncause anyone using it to potentially be banned by another part of Google. This\nalso means questions that have hung over other page testing tools such as\nOffermatica should go away.\nIt won’t make the\ncloaking debate necessarily easier, however. Consider the\nJamie Roche (CEO of Offermatica) makes to the traditional wisdom that if a page\nis ranking well, you don’t want to alter it much.\nRand argues the major factors controlling rank are mostly off-the-page\n(importance of your domain, links to your pages) and thus not impacted by change\nto the page itself. I’m largely with him. If a page is doing well, altering it\nreally shouldn’t have that much of an impact, unless you’re doing something\nreally drastic such as replacing all the text for images. And yet — I’d still\nbe cautious, despite knowing that’s not likely something to fear.\nThis leads back to Roche’s\nis clearly reacting to clients that are concerned that his product, Offermatica,\nmight suggest changes that could cause them to lose rankings. So, there’s an\nelement of self-interest in his writing. But I still find many of his points\nvalid:\nUnfortunately, even if you don’t mess with your page, your rank could\nchange. That’s because the rules that the search engines use to rank sites\nchange as they discover newer, and presumably better, ways to rank results. A\npage that ranked well one day might drop to the third or fourth page the next,\nor get removed altogether.\nThe result is that we live in a state of fear about changing well-ranked\npages, while knowing that even if we don’t change them we could lose rank\nanyway.\nSo when we realize that we want to change our natural search landing pages\nbecause they don’t provide the best user experience, we wonder whether it\nmight make sense to experiment with changes despite our fears.\nHe then also gets into three tactics, warning that potentially, they could\nget you delisted or cause a rank drop:\nTest various pages, and keep showing spiders the original one during\ntesting. Anyone not seeing what the spider sees is technically getting a\ncloaked page. Yes, as he notes, that’s what Google Website Optimizer does —\nso Google itself seems to be giving tacit approval to cloaking.\n \nChange just some of the page. He seems to think this is a bigger\nrisk. I think it’s minor. The main risk is that if you change some of the page\nusing JavaScript, potentially that could be seen as cloaking. But that’s part\nof the page testing opt-out already covered above.\n \nTarget pages to second-time visitors. Search engines don’t read\ncookies. So if you cookie a first time visitor, you can then show them a\ndifferent page when they return, even if they go to the same original URL.\nSearch engines will continue to see the same page every time, since they won’t\nhave a cookie.\nNow here’s an even more complicated issue. Many who do good old-fashioned\ncloaking have long argued that it doesn’t matter how they get ranking, as long\nas they are relevant. So what if they use gibberish text or put out some\nhighly-optimized textual content? As long as they show the visitor a relevant\npage, what’s the harm? Indeed, if you buy into the argument that what you do on\nthe page largely doesn’t matter — that it’s really down to domain authority and\nlinks — then it becomes even harder to understand why cloaking is such an\nissue.\nMoreover, what prevents someone from eternally testing a page? If you gain a\nranking with some butt-ugly page, you might then keep feeding that to spiders\nbut constantly test it with a page testing tool. Potentially, that keeps you out\nof the cloaking hot seat yet it does the same exact thing that cloaking does.\nOverall, Google in particular has dodged its outdated guidelines on cloaking\ntime-and-time again over the past few years. My\nDebate About Cloaking Happens Again article from last month provides the\nbackground here. They can’t keep dodging it in the case of page testing tools\nnow, not when they themselves are offering one. So I’m pinging them for the\nofficial word.\nAs for the tool, here’s more from the formal announcement:\nAs part of our continued commitment to help advertisers make smart business\ndecisions, we are happy to announce that the Google Website Optimizer™\napplication is now available to AdWords advertisers worldwide. Google Website\nOptimizer is designed to help website owners increase conversions such as\nsales, sign-ups or downloads. This multivariate landing page optimization tool\nenables marketers to test different ideas for web page content such as\ndifferent headlines, promotional copy, or images. The application provides\neasy-to-read reports that enable advertisers to see which variation resonated\nbest with their site visitor. It is a self-service application that enables\nwebsite owners to set-up and run multivariate landing page experiments.\nGoogle Website Optimizer is a beta application that is integrated with the\nGoogle AdWords™ program and free to AdWords advertisers. Advertisers can sign\nup immediately at www.google.com/websiteoptimizer. Over the coming weeks, the\nGoogle Website Optimizer application will become available automatically in\nall advertisers’ accounts. Website owners can now determine what content was\nmost effective as indicated by the highest conversion rate.\nBy giving website owners the tools they need to improve their website\ncontent, Google is helping improve the user experience on the internet as a\nwhole. Since the beta launch of the application in October 2006, many\nadvertisers who used Google Website Optimizer have achieved major results.\n\"Using Website Optimizer enables us to approach our website like a living\nlab, where we can test and play and constantly figure out how to improve the\nsite,\" says Deborah Krier, Marketing Manager, Dale and Thomas Popcorn,\n\"Website Optimizer is a powerful tool that allows us to understand our users\nbetter, leading to increased conversions and increased business success.\"\nIn addition, we are announcing the formation of a new partner program,\nGoogle Website Optimizer Authorized Consultants. As of today, Optimost,\nEpikOne, Future Now, ROI Revolution, and SiteTuners.com have signed on as\ncharter members.\n“We’re delighted that Google is now offering Website Optimizer. In the\npast, not everyone had the tools to test regularly,” said Bryan Eisenberg,\nco-founder, Future Now, Inc. and author of the New York Times bestseller Call\nto Action, “Google Analytics had a major effect on the accessibility of data\nand on how website owners valued analytics; Website Optimizer will take the\nbenefits of testing to a much broader audience and help them increase online\nconversion rates.”\nFor more information or to sign up to use Website Optimizer, please visit:\nwww.google.com/websiteoptimizer\nDanny Sullivan\nDanny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

Well, that’s not stopping Aaron Crayford, who convinced a bunch of his supercomputer engineer buddies to put together Rippol , a video discovery site that blends hardcore machine learning with social streams. Rippol (not to be confused with rrripple , the media sharing site ) is coming out of stealth today into private beta. Be one of the first 1,000 people to try it by signing up here . (If you don’t get an invite, the site will be launching publicly in a month at our next Realtime Crunchup ).\nRippol is still in raw form (the UI needs more polish, not all the buttons work the way they should), but it is experimenting with some powerful ideas in online video. You can sign in with Facebook Connect, or create your own account (it will also support Twitter and Gmail sign-ins soon). Once you have friends on the system, it lets you discover new videos through your friends. The homepage is an activity stream of the videos you and your friends have watched, favorited, rated, and reviewed. And a global stream in the left column shows what the broader Rippol community is watching. Links to any video can also be shared on Facebook or Tweeted out.\nYou can click on any video mentioned in the stream to watch it, and chat with friends via Facebook Chat, which pops up from the bottom left of the browser window. Displaying videos as a realtime stream of information is a discovery mechanism that we are beginning to see in cutting-edge video sites like Magma (our review ). And I suspect it will become adopted more broadly.\nHowever, Rippol doesn’t rely solely on your friends’ activities to help you find interesting videos. The site is also a standalone video discovery engine in its own right. You can watch about 500,000 videos right now in the Rippol player, which can be detached like a chat box and moved around in front of the screen, while you search for more videos, check out your stream or chat with friends.\nRippol ingests videos from other sites like Hulu and YouTube and then it runs them through its “Butterfly Network” (see diagram at right, click for larger image). Here is where the machine learning comes in. The Butterfly Network looks at all of your video-related activities in the site, those of your friends, and those of people in your demographic. All of the videos on the site have particularly good metadata (titles, genres, actors, descriptions), which lets Rippol take advantage of data-mining techniques to recommend videos for you. It creates a genre cloud for different categories of videos (TV Shows, Movies, Sports, News),and then generates a list of videos for each genre tag you click on.\nDepending on what genre of videos you are looking for, Rippol’s realtime ranking servers shows you videos associated with ones you’ve watched or liked in the past, your friends have watched or liked, and people in your demographic have watched or liked. If you click on comedies and martial arts videos, those will rank higher for you in the future.\nSince Rippol has all the realtime stream data as well, the video results are skewed towards what people are watching right now. Your own actions impact the rankings the most, followed by those of your friends, followed by those of people in your age and gender group. And if you are a 45-year-old male who tends to watch videos more like a 25-year-old male, it adjusts the demo it associates with your actual watching habits.\nThe system is supposed to get smarter the more you use it, and the more your friends use it. So it’s hard to evaluate how effective it will be right now with only a handful of users, but it is a promising approach. Soon users will be able to suggest videos to add to the site. (Crayford says he’s come up with a novel way to filter out inappropriate videos from the broader community by taking into account what is acceptable to different social groups).\nCrayford’s last company, Vusion , specialized in high-definition video streaming over the Web. It’s patents, intellectual property, and other assets were acquired by the Clarendon Foundation in June, 2009. Craydon learned from that experience that advanced technology can only take you so far, and this time around he is trying to create a complete consumer experience rather than just an enabling technology. Rippol is completely bootstrapped so far.\nScreenshots:\n", "deleted" : false }

Mastercard, Visa, Discovery, Amex... and Trustcash is another to consider. Tens of millions of potential internet daters don't have credit cards in the U.S.A. Many more don't really want a dating site showing up on their credit cards. So, you really, really should offer some kind of prepaid card cash payment method. Trustcash has internet dating industry experience. Here's my interview with Greg Moss. - Mark Brooks\nWhat is Trustcash’s founding story?\nE-commerce has had strong consistent growth year in and year out since inception. With growth like this in any industry come various risks. In this specific case it happens to be increased concerns with privacy and security After recognizing this an opportunity presented itself to create a stored value transaction system that would allow anyone with Internet access – even those without credit cards – to buy anonymously and safely online just as they would at a traditional retailer today with cash.\nI can walk into a store today and buy a magazine with cash and no one will ever know I made that purchase. And it’s secure. That’s what we’ve built here at Trustcash .\nWhat does the service do?\nBasically, the service allows people to take a $50 bill and insert it into their computer. People can go to one of 60,000 Trustcash designated retail outlets throughout the country, hand the clerk cash and in exchange receive a Trustcash number that is similar to a credit card number, but without their personal data tied to it. It’s a unique 12-digit alphanumeric number worth the dollar amount paid and you can take that number and use it to make online purchases at merchants that accept Trustcash as a form of payment. This includes hard goods, services and subscription based businesses. By using Trustcash for their online transactions people can keep their transactions private and, since there is no personal information tied to their Trustcash number it is secure from hackers and their private life is kept private. This type of transaction has also given a whole new opportunity to people who are unbanked or under banked. Over 50 million people in the U.S. alone don’t possess credit cards or don’t have the credit available to make purchases online. Trustcash gives these consumers the opportunity to get better product availability and pricing via the internet.\nWhere precisely can people buy Trustcash?\nToday, it’s currently available in about 60,000 locations across the U.S.. We expect that by the first quarter of next year, we’ll take the service to an additional 60,000 locations internationally, beginning with Canada and then moving into Europe. Trustcash can also be purchased online using a credit card. This service is for customers who do not wish to give the end merchant their personal data or worry about their personal data being stored in an unknown database online. When buying Trustcash with a credit card, it is a one time purchase and all of your data is purged following the transaction. Beyond these forms of distribution, there are several more relationships in the works with both financial institutions and prepaid companies that will continue to increase our availability around the country.\nWho are your signature internet dating clients?\nFor the last six months, we’ve been working closely with a leading dating company called IWANTU. They have been great to work with and extremely patient while we spent the time understanding who the target customer is and how we can help generate incremental revenue for their program. It is important to understand the space before you roll out in any real magnitude.\nWe have signed several more leading dating programs which are now in integration and currently have verbal commitments from another six while they review our merchant agreement.\nHow can you help internet dating companies make more money?\nThat’s the question and this is where it gets exciting. Social networks and dating sites have essentially become the modern day personals. The internet has opened this world up and plenty of people are coming to the dating sites. And although many will sign up for a free account, there’s a sizable amount that just won’t convert to paying customers. They get to a point where they feel their personal data will be compromised or they won’t be able to keep their private life private (perhaps someone in their life, like a spouse or significant other, will discover what they’re doing through a credit card or checking account statement). We give these people a sense of security. By keeping their private lives private and secure, we’re able to convert more free subscribers for these dating programs. We’re bringing them an entirely new market of customers who previously wouldn’t use their services out of privacy and security fears.\nWho are your competitors?\nRight now, we’re considered an alternative payment system. As far as competition, it’s tough to say that we have a direct competitor. There are a lot of companies – the PayBy Phone, ACH companies, Dialers, ChargeMeLater, PayPal, Google Buy,  all competing for the alternative biller spot with merchants. But, fortunately, these companies cannot offer complete privacy and most have swayed from certain verticals and markets. This has given us an opportunity to come in and demonstrate our value proposition to both the customer and merchant.\nWhat are your goals for 2007 through 2008 for Trustcash?\nI think we’ve discovered a market that has a big need for a service like Trustcash . Dating has proven that there is a large portion of free subscribers that truly need and want what Trustcash has to offer. Our priority right now is to hone in on the dating market and make sure we do a first class job with both the customer and the merchant experiences. In tandem we will continue to build our brand with traditional and non-traditional marketing campaigns. As for 2008 and beyond we will enter into mainstream verticals that make the most sense for the company based on the current demographic of our customer.\nSep 26, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

He was among a small number of “Googlaires” who had lots of money, great connections, and the ability to see many web startups before traditional VCs.\nIn fact, many in the industry viewed Senkut and his ilk as arrivistes, and Senkut has been on his unwavering mission since, first to first impress them, then to surpass them. His execution has been pretty spot on, too. Felicis Ventures , the San Francisco-based firm that he founded 10 years ago and he now manages with three other investors, just closed its fifth fund with $200 million. That’s nearly double the amount Felicis gathered up for its fourth fund less than two years ago.\nInstitutions are writing out big checks left and right these days. But it’s easy to understand why Felicis’s limited partners were particularly open to providing the firm with more capital. Felicis has invested in 180 startups to date. Three of those companies have gone public, including Fitbit and Shopify. At least three others — Credit Karma , Planet Labs , and Adyen — appear positioned to go public.\nMeanwhile, another 60 companies in Felicis’s portfolio have enjoyed what Senkut calls “meaningful exits.” Most meaningful, seemingly, Felicis was an early investor in Cruise Automation, which is being acquired by General Motors for more than $1 billion; it backed the cloud infrastructure startup Meraki, acquired by Cisco for $1.2 billion in cash; it invested in Twitch, acquired by Amazon for $970 million in cash; and it backed Climate Corp., which Monsanto bought for roughly $930 million.\nIf you’re wondering about the number of companies that have flamed out after receiving a check from Felicis, Senkut says it’s is in the “very low digits; it’s in the teens percentage on a dollar-adjusted basis.”\nWhen we talked earlier this week, Senkut suggested Felicis’s success so far owes to what he characterizes as a unique strategy.\n", "deleted" : false }

wireless traffic\nNetwork analytics startup provides insight into wireline and wireless traffic\nSaaS service shows “the correlation between all the moving parts,” says satisfied early user\nJohn Dix (Network World) 18 April, 2016 14:00\n-\nComments\nStartup Nyansa Inc. today launched a SaaS-based IT network analytics service that can inspect, analyze and correlate wireline and wireless data to help large campus IT shops speed network problem resolution and create performance baselines that can be used for network tuning, gauging the impact of network changes, and justifying new network investments.\nThe CEO and co-founder of the company, which has raised $12 million in venture backing, is Abe Ankumah, onetime Senior Director of Products and Business Operations at Aruba Networks, who went on to become Director of Client Products and Alliances at Meraki.  When Meraki was acquired by Cisco in 2012 Ankumah became Director of Cisco’s Cloud Networking Group, but left in late 2013 to cofound Nyansa with CTO Anand Srinivas and VP of Engineering Daniel Kan.\nNyansa (pronounced “ni-ans-sah”) prides itself on being able to gather and inspect wireline AND wireless data -- and even wireless metrics -- for use in performance analysis, and stresses that it doesn’t require agents on end user client devices and that it can correlate and summarize, in plain English, “data for every client network transaction from initial connection to application access.”\nThe meshing of the wired and wireless worlds is a good leg up for Nyansa, says Zeus Kerrvala, founder and principal analyst with ZK Research.  “We’re living in a world where everything is connected, and in many organizations wireless is the primary connection, so being able to incorporate the two is critical,” he says. “Wired and wireless visibility is typically done separately and you end up having to correlate this stuff manually.  There are probably some engineers out there that can do that, but most companies probably don’t have that level person.  I think there is a real opening here.”\nHow it works\nWhile the company’s Voyance service does not require installation of hardware appliances or client agents, customers will need to install one or more of Nyansa’s virtual machine-based “crawlers” that “extract and inspect all wired traffic from a mirrored span or tap port as traffic passes through network switches,” the company says.  “This information is fused with wireless metrics gathered from WLAN controllers.  Voyance currently supports Cisco, Aruba and Ruckus WLAN controlled environments.”\nThe crawlers look at all data but only forward performance metrics to the cloud for correlation by the Voyance cloud analytics engine, which is hosted in AWS.  CTO Srinivas says that every gigabit of traffic results in about 500K bit/sec of information that is forwarded to the cloud for analysis.  “Some of our largest customers are moving 3G to 4Gbps, so they’re seeing 2.5M-3Mbps going up to the cloud.”\nThe ability to see, collect and analyze both wireline and wireless data is key because Wi-Fi is “causing the biggest pain for the network ops guys because it has become the primary way people connect and it’s harder to troubleshoot those problems,” says VP of Marketing David Callisch, formerly of Ruckus.\n“Within Wi-Fi we can see eight or ten metrics, everything from channel width, feature set, what access points are deployed and whether band steering is being used,” he says.  “So if someone calls in complaining about a Wi-Fi problem, we can look at everything from the time they connect and every network service they go through to hit an application.  It might not be a Wi-Fi problem after all.  Maybe they’re not getting an IP address, or not authenticating to a server or the application is performing poorly.  We can help guide IT ops.”\nEarly user Mike Fitzgerald, Network Architect and Senior Network Engineer at Brandeis University, says that kind of insight is valuable.  Voyance “sees the conversations between the wireless clients and the underlying support -- the DNS servers, the DHCP servers -- so it will call out that, ‘This person seems to be having a bad experience, but it isn’t your wireless, its their DHCP didn’t work or your DNS lookups are slow or latency is off.’  So it is a great tool because you can go to one place and get a lot of root cause analysis.”\nThose types of problems, Fitzgerald says, “would be hard to see unless you have a tool like this that can show you the correlation between all the moving parts.  It has also helped us identify behaviors on our network that we didn’t know existed because they weren’t hard faults. Stuff just gets slow every once in a while and you’d like to know why.  And now its like, ‘Oh look, when that stuff seems slow it is because this thing is happening over here,’ so it is great tool that way.”\nBaselining benefits\nBut root cause analysis is only one thing Voyance was designed to address, Srinivas says. \nOnce installed, Voyance starts building a baseline of the environment, a profile that enables the company to address a range of other needs, including analyzing how network changes effect performance and end user experience.\n“That’s one thing IT struggles with,” Callisch says.  “They put in a new DNS server, and they don’t know if that change was good or bad.  With Voyance, they can show what actually happened.”\nCritical to that analysis is keeping the load the same so you’re comparing apples to apples, Srinivas says: “Let’s take DHCP as an example.  You added another DHCP server and you expect it to reduce latency by X.  You have to keep the load the same to see if it actually made a difference.  Because we collect all this data, we can find periods of time when the load was the same for the before-and-after analysis.” \nBecause Nyansa collects all this data in the cloud, it also makes it possible to compare and contrast anonymized customer network analytics so companies can see how their environments stack up to those of similar sized operations in their industry, Srinivas says. \nSticking with a DHCP example, Voyance makes it possible for a customer considering DHCP configuration changes to see what happened when other customers tried a similar change.  “We don’t make a recommendation as to whether you should do it or not,” Srinivas says, “but, without saying who they are, we can show you what happened when other people did it.”\nHaving the ability to compare and contrast also can help you figure out what projects to take on, he says. \n“Let’s say network clients that cannot connect to DNS went from 0.5% to 0.3%,” Srinivas says.  “The question any IT person would need to answer is, ‘Should I work on making that 0% or is 0.3% actually good enough?’”  With Voyance you can see what the norm is for similar institutions and then focus your energy on efforts that matter.\nThat also has implications for network investments.  If, for example, peer operations deliver better end user experiences, you can drill down and possibly use that information to justify, say, an upgrade to gigabit Wi-Fi.\nAsked if any customers are worried about sharing this type of information, Callisch said none of the company’s roughly 25 customers have yet refused. \nThis experience sharing approach is “pretty cool,” says Kerrvala of ZK Research.  “I read all the time about how IT isn’t that proactive.  As a former IT guy I take offense at that.  It isn’t that they aren’t proactive. They haven’t really had the tools to be proactive.  You can’t manage a digital network with tools that were made for a different era, and that was what engineers really have had to do to date.  It is getting more and more important to have management based on analytics because that lets you move to a more predictive model.”\nEarly user Fitzgerald at Brandeis says the university is just starting to work with Voyance’s compare and contrast functions: “We seem to compare pretty well.  There are some places where we might be a little off so we’ll look at that.”\nBut the ability of the service to provide a bigger picture view is already paying dividends, he says.  “We have a couple of buildings that have higher incidents of poorer performance and we didn’t think we had a problem in those buildings.   No one is complaining, but now we have something to go investigate.”\nIn another case he says the service “showed us that one DNS server was getting hammered all the time compared to the rest of them and suggested we look into that.  So we did and we found a firewall was pretty much using the same source port all the time so the load balancer was thinking it was all one conversation and was routing all its requests to one server.  Its that kind of stuff where the value of this kind of product shines.”\nNyansa says it is targeting large campus environments with tens of thousands of devices in vertical markets such as education, manufacturing and healthcare.\nSubscriptions to the SaaS service are available in 1-3 or 5 year contracts for different size buckets -- small, medium, large, x-large and custom.\n", "deleted" : false }

Good luck with that.\nIs that possible? RoundPegg thinks so. So must Access Venture Partners and Croghan Investments, which today announced $1.27 million in funding for the eHarmony of job-search sites .\nBut I don't.\nSurprisingly, it is proving easier to apply science to affairs of the heart than affairs of the workplace. Though far from proven , eHarmony has been successful winning over believers in it's 29-dimensions of compatibility . Using eHarmony's secret-sauce algorithm, dating members who answer the 29-dimensions test honestly have decent shot of being matched with someone who will share common traits, likes, dislikes, etc. They're likely to \"date well together\" and, perhaps, \"marry well together.\"\nThe problem is that in the job-search business, no one has developed a compatibility test or algorithm that matches employees and employers likely to \"work well together.\" At least not as successfully as eHarmony.\nRoundPegg thinks they've done it, according to the report in TechCrunch.\nThe site aims to match employers and potential employees based on personality and culture matches as well as skills and experience. Founder Tim Wolters says that currently the site has thousands of job seekers and hundreds of companies who are looking for employees that fit within their corporate culture.\nRoundPegg is working under the idea that matching common traits, likes, dislikes, etc. should apply to the job search as well, something supported by the research on personality traits and workplace culture of Mark Mallinger, a professor of applied behavioral science at the Graziadio School of Business and Management's at Pepperdine University.\nIt is generally assumed that a successful relationship between an individual and an organization is based on a shared foundation of beliefs and behaviors. Similar beliefs and ways of working usually encourage communication and tend to support the working relationship, allowing synergies to emerge. In contrast, a high level of dissimilarity usually requires a high consumption of adaptive energy.\nRoundPegg, and any site that claims to be the eHarmony of jobs, faces a difficult task if they want to base their matching system on personality and culture profiles. Because, unlike affairs of the heart, when it comes to affairs of the job, most of us lie.\nLie is a strong word. Misrepresent is probably more accurate. Both sides of the engagement --  employees and employers -- misrepresent culture and personality and most do so unintentionally or at least without malice.\nHow many employers describe themselves as \"dynamic,\" \"transparent,\" \"open to new ideas.\" How many are those things?\nHow many would-be employees sell themselves using words like \"self-starter,\" \"energetic leader,\" \"results focused.\" How many are those things?\nIs it intentional? In part. What company would advertise itself as an \"antiquated,\" \"top-down,\" micromanaged\" place to work.\nMore innocently, recruiters say most hiring managers don't know how to define the position , let alone the culture.\n\"Typically, [hiring managers] have a difficult time delineating this because they have a bucket list of what they want,\" [said Regina Angeles, owner of executive search firm Talent2050 ]... So she explains that a list of bullet points is not that useful and then educates them about how the req has to be more marketing-oriented to be truly effective.\nRecently, Angeles completed a search for a new sales strategy position within a large advertising sales group. Some recruiters might have seen this as cut and dried, calling for nothing more than that bullet list. Angeles worked with the manager to define the strategic elements of the position, the interactions within the sales organization and the ongoing mandates the person would be in charge of. In other words, what initiatives would the person be expected to push through? The candidate was also expected to conduct competitive research.\nExecutive recruiters swear up and down that recruiting is an art, not a science -- that there is no way to for any method other than a trained and honed hiring pro to judge and match the compatibility between employee and employer. It is difficult to train even a human to be a fellow recruiter, let alone a machine, argues Glen Cathey on his blog Boolean Blackbelt.\nI believe that the 20% that is \"art\" is not actually tied to the recruiting life cycle or process itself. I believe the \"art\" comes from the person performing the recruiting role - in other words, the \"human factor\" in the equation. As I've previously mentioned - you can't teach someone to be passionate about recruiting, nor can you teach someone to have a solid work ethic, or to be tenacious and driven to produce great win-win recruiting outcomes. Each recruiter is unique, inevitably bringing their own set of intangibles to the application of recruiting best practices.\nIn my experience, even judgment and \"feel\" can be taught to a certain extent - but it won't come from a single training class. It can be accomplished under the guidance of recruiting manager, coach, or mentor (however you define the role) who works with you on a daily basis and provides you with feedback and suggestions for any scenario you encounter.\nUnless they're using a lie detector test or a Myer's-Briggs on BOTH sides of the compatibility questionaire, RoundPegg won't be the eHarmony of the job search, nor will anyone else. Heck, there are plenty of reasons to doubt that eHarmony isn't the eHarmony of dating .\nRelated Content:\n", "deleted" : false }

February 2013 gamigo Inc. has acquired substantial assets from the San Francisco based publisher, Outspark. The license of the successful online game, Fiesta Online, for the USA, Canada, and Mexico is to become a part of gamigo’s extensive online games portfolio. gamigo Inc. is a 100% subsidiary of the fast growing gamigo AG, one of the leading European publishers of online games in the Free-to-Play market. Fiesta Online is already operated and marketed by gamigo in Europe (including Germany, France, Italy, and Spain). The acquisition of the North American license for Fiesta Online with over 1.2 million registered players means a substantial turnover growth as well as improvement in efficiency for marketing and game development. Fiesta Online is a very successful MMORPG and is very popular with its players thanks to its community features and gameplay. The purchase price is not to be released. “It’s an amazing exit to Outspark, one of the earliest and greatest founders of the Free-to-Play MMO space” said Philip Yun, CEO of Outspark. “We’ve had a great time building up Outspark and gamigo will take the combined Fiesta to the next stage and build further onto the pioneer work that has been done by Outspark. We are happy to announce that also a substantial part of the team has joined gamigo, and will work from gamigo’s San Francisco office to manage and support the games.” Due to this acquisition gamigo Inc. will be relocating its US office from New York to San Francisco and the staff will be increased. In parallel to this, gamigo will also increase its marketing efforts for its existing titles in North America. As well as Fiesta, the online games Cultures Online, King of Kings 3, Golfstar and Loong will especially be focused upon. Patrick Streppel, Executive Board Member at gamigo, said: “The acquisition of the North American license of Fiesta Online is a big step for gamigo as part of our increased focus on our strongest titles. This will further strengthen our international position and generate further synergies. In addition, the already excellent co-operation with the Korean game developer Ons On Soft, of which gamigo AG holds a minority stake, will be further intensified.”  \nRelated posts:\n", "deleted" : false }

My world has been turned inside out, as has the world of everyone else I’ve happily shared this vision with via a two-minute video.\nOn January 22, 2015, the world learned that we are one significant step closer to claiming a seat at the table on Mount Olympus. The good people that brought us the Kinect and Xbox have been hard at work in a Herculean effort to redefine how we see the world. Since there are obviously man-centuries of work involved here and we “normals” have only just gotten wind of it, I can only assume they were sequestered in some sort of programmer cave and fed and watered on a regular basis.\nThe vision shown by HoloLens from Microsoft is a game changer. Not because it’s from Microsoft; there are several other companies working towards the same goal. And not because of its present form; it is just a prototype that by most accounts is cumbersome and uncomfortable. The reason that it is so important is because it shows an amazing and achievable new paradigm for the future. It presents a vision; with a video of just a few use cases and two minutes of my life, it changed how I see our world.\nMy every view is now augmented with an overlay, or more accurately with a hologram. HoloLens shows us how we can seamlessly blend the real and the virtual worlds. But more importantly, it shows us a very possible cure for our worsening human-disconnect condition brought on by our increasing connect-to-machine condition. The vision that HoloLens promises is very very different from that of face-based computing predecessors.\nNo matter what I write, it will not come close to painting the picture you get from that two-minute video. If you have not seen it, check it out here and enjoy the red pill. … I’ll wait …\nNow that you have viewed the video, I assume that you are now experiencing what I refer to clinically as the EXPLETIVE moment and realize there is no going back. Don’t worry, the drool is normal.\nThere is an infinite number of directions that this article can now go to wax poetic about the life altering value of this new medium and all of the use cases that are possible. However, as I have already pointed out, my brain is broken. So I will simply suggest three new use cases that involve your home, for your newly broken brains to visualize.\n1. Holograms promise a world where YOU choose what your world looks like by mixing real and virtual any way you see fit. This is massively disruptive, because things you buy for your home, like TVs, paintings, fixtures, pets, etc., can be replaced by virtual dynamic and magical representations. And these things can be virtually shared with real people in your life.\n2. Now, sprinkle in the massive world of information-generating devices collectively known as IoT, a world in which I and my brain have been happily immersed for the last 22 years. Envision a hologram of your house sitting on your desk at work. The house lights up and animates to reflect the stream of data as it originates from your IoT devices and flows into your hologram house. Truly, seeing is believing.\n3. Now add in a simple security camera on the outside of your actual house and things get real. Imagine a hologram created by this camera that extends the outside of your house hologram to reflect everything that is captured within the security camera’s field of view. This means all of the people and cars going by that the camera sees are now walking and driving by your hologram house on your desk. Don’t even get me started about how you can now gamify this into a round of whack-a-mole.\nTo find more exclusive insights from tech industry insiders,\nThe possible variations are truly endless. As Microsoft so elegantly said to wrap the video: “When you change the way you see your world, you can change the world you see.”\nPoints!!\nOf course, this is just what I think. I would love to know what you guys think. What mind-warping hologram goodness can you imagine and see as valuable? Comment as early and often as you like. I will be here gleefully gazing at the world around me and seeing what will be … and drooling.\nI should also point out that I will be tweeting about new and interesting use cases as they come into view, so follow me @theiotguru .\nJim Hunter is chief scientist and technology evangelist at Greenwave Systems .

The technology, which it has been using for about one year, has helped Travel Leaders of Fargo engage more deeply with more potential customers, helping it set the foundation for longer term relationships.\n\"The main driver for adding Workface to our online presence is our need to capture and capitalize on potential online leaders that we knew were out there,\" said Cindy Tyo, owner of Travel Leaders of Fargo . \" 'Virtually' putting our agents in online locations where clients and prospects could immediately connect with us is giving my agents a competitive advantage. Simply put, Workface lets us touch those who are online in ways that other communication platforms can't.\"\nThe organization started with three seats of the Workface software, but doubled it to six after its initial testing.\nThe Workface Customer Engagement Platform enables salespeople, marketing managers and customer service agents to set up personal profiles that can be reached via their Web site. That means the interaction that Web site visitors have with potential customers and general visitors is more \"human\" and more akin to the face-to-face interaction that someone would have with your small business if they were to walk in the front door, said Workface founder and president Lief Larson.\nThe graphic below gives you an idea of what the application looks like on your Web site. When you click chat, instead of a text-only window, the Workface Customer Engagement Platform gives your prospects other options for communicating including video or voice.\n\"Approximately 89 percent of customers are doing due diligence online before they buy. This makes that interaction seem more personal,\" Larson said.\nA Workface profile doesn't just have to live on your company's Web site. It actually can live in other place where a customer might stumble upon information about your company, such as Facebook, or be served up with search engine results. Workface touts these four primary advantage for businesses that use its software:\nIdentity control, meaning that the profile is the same in many different places (and consistent) (It also makes it easier to shut off an account for someone who might have left the company)\nRelationship management, allowing salespeople or customer-service reps to establish a one-on-one interaction\nImagery, meaning that a person's human face is presented, not a disembodied chat agent\nReal time, meaning that whomever is available can respond, so that prospects aren't bounded around in voicemail or circuitous response systems where they can't reach someone \"live\"\nAs the name suggests, Workface scales up into large businesses, but the company is encouraging small and midsize businesses to get involved. As of August 2011, it had raised approximately $2.5 million in venture financing.\nSmall and midsize businesses can actually try three seats of the software at no cost, Larson said. If you choose to go beyond that, you'll pay $25 per user, per month, he said.\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

Since then, I've honed down a process of getting custom parts made in China that are high quality, on spec and on budget.\nHere's a 5-step process that I use to generate high quality parts over the Internet with a Chinese engineer.\nThe Big Picture\nAt a high level - it's really all about communication. Sure there are some suppliers out there that simply cannot reach the quality you need no matter how hard they try, but after sourcing dozens of parts I've only come by this once. Excellent communication is the only way to get parts done right the first time.\nWebsites like MFG.com , which are basically engineer matchmaking systems, have made this process easier than ever; but they are not without their pitfalls. Communication is still a big area of weakness when sourcing parts in China for the first time.\nStep 1: Organize 3D part files and notes\nUnless you speak Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese (btw most engineers are from Hong Kong, so mandarin is mostly useless) then photos and screenshots are your best friend with communication. Imagine that you are trying to explain your drawings in person - you'd probably use a ton of hand gestures, pointing and short phrases right? Annotated screenshots and photos are how you gesture in the digital space.\nDon't believe that simply sending a 3D model will do the job on communication. You see, tight tolerances are very expensive - like getting within 0.003 on every dimension. You don't want or need to go to the tightest tolerance on every dimension of your part. The Chinese manufacturers know this as well, so if you don't tell them anything regarding tolerances then you will end up with either (1) a cheap part without any tight tolerances or (2) a very expensive part with tight tolerances everywhere. You need to fall somewhere in the middle. Most tight tolerances are only needed for press fits or bearing slots. Otherwise, looser and cheaper tolerances work.\nUse arrows and text on photos or screenshots to point out critical areas and tolerances. If you are pressing a bearing or working with an off-the-shelf part - make a note of what part you are using and the engineer will be able to get one and test on the part in China. Your engineer may even be able to build your part on their side if you are using enough off-the-shelf parts.\nApple's native Preview application annotates images very easily and I'm sure there is a PC equivalent out there. Over-communicate your needs and confirm that the engineer understands these requirements. Arrows and text will work wonders with digital communication.\nStep 2: Create bids\nCreating a bid on MFG is simple. All you need is a 3D file of your part (.STP is the most universal file type), material and quantity to submit a bid. Be sure to include your notes so these manufacturers know the tolerance requirements up front. Be ready to make more notes for the candidate suppliers.\nYou will likely have a variety of plastic, metal and electronic parts - so you should have a different supplier for each category. Bundling these parts by manufacturing operation will get better quotes and take advantage of volume pricing.\nDismiss anyone that claims they can do it all. There are manufacturers out there that can do it all - but they aren't on MFG.com and they require thousands of orders to give you their time. The engineers on MFG are small, hungry experts in a specific trade that are willing to do short runs.\nStep 3: Negotiate sample fees & order samples\nBids will start rolling in about 24 hours after you post. Remember that China is exactly 12 hours off the Eastern time zone. Therefore, your main communication will take place from 8pm EST until you pretty much can't open your eyes anymore. If you are in a hurry, then it is a grind.\nMFG organizes bids inside their system. I like to keep all vendor communication inside MFG so that I can easily track down communication or notes when needed the future.\nPayment terms are typically upfront costs for molds (if necessary) and samples. The samples shouldn't cost more than the negotiated part cost in production. You shouldn't have to put a deposit on the production run until you're satisfied with the samples. On top of all that, sample shipping is expensive - so the next step is very important.\nStep 4: Before samples ship, get a 9-photo digital sample\nIt is so frustrating to get your samples in the mail and find a part that is clearly off spec. Now you need to wait weeks for another sample! This can be easily avoided by what I call the 9-photo digital sample. It is easy - just require that your engineer take 9, and no less than 9, photos from different angles.\nI've found that if they take 9 photos of the part then rarely anything will be missed. If you want to be super thorough about it then have them take photos with calipers to prove critical measurements. I've even gone as far as having suppliers make short video clips of specific mechanics to prove their parts can work correctly!\nStep 5: Analyze samples and choose supplier\nFinally the fun part! You've gotten your samples and testing them, but always be sure to mark who provided which sample. In my excitement of un-boxing, I've made this mistake a few times and have had to painfully go back and track down who made what. This can be impossible if the parts are otherwise undistinguishable from each other.\nOverall, MFG is a great place that empowers inventors to make their dreams come true on a budget. Always ask if there is an existing off-the-shelf part that you can use. I have gotten lucky a few times like this and got to skip the entire process for that part. Otherwise, work my system and cut down development time significantly.\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\nPublished on: Dec 15, 2015\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Syndicaster is an online editing and video-clip management service that allows TV stations to any broadcast news clip and repurpose it for the Web by publishing it to their own Websites or through its sister service ClipSyndicate (both Syndicaster and ClipSyndicate are divisions of Critical Media ).\nNow Syndicaster is adding one-click distribution options to the major video sites so that local TV affiliates or station groups can post their videos to AOL Money & Finance or their YouTube channel, and manage it all from one place. One feature that TV customers will appreciate is the ability to set embargo windows for each service, allowing a TV station to publish hot news immediately to its own site, then 24 or 36 hours later to video partner sites where it makes the most money, and then maybe finally to YouTube.\nSyndicaster has also recently added an on-location feature which allows TV reporters and crews to upload clips directly from wherever they are capturing the footage, and making that footage available as Web video clips even if it never gets airtime. Affiliated stations can also go to Syndicaster to find footage and use it either on the Web or on-air, depending on their arrangements with each other. When that airplane crashed in Buffalo, NY recently, a local station put all of its footage on Syndicaster, and other affiliated stations around the country used it to grab video footage for their own on-air reports.\nSyndicaster charges a flat subscription fee of about $850 a month per TV station or news organization. With 60 paying customers, that comes to about $50,000 a month a few months after launch, with a lot of runway for growth. Syndicaster is exploring ways to bring its online editing and video distribution platform to consumers, but so far it is stumped in that area. CEO Sean Morgan admits:\nLook, I don’t know how to make money on the consumer. I’d like to make money on this. We are getting great traction from broadcasters. Bringing it to newspapers is obviously the next path forward.\nIn May, the company plans to expand its reach to newspaper sites with Syndicaster for Newspapers. As news organizations of all stripes make video a bigger component of their online offerings, Syndicaster is hoping to become the industry standard for ingesting, editing, and distributing these videos. Maybe the A.P. should look into it.\n", "deleted" : false }

That comes at the same time many developers are enamored with Google’s technical chops, along with some of the technical capabilities of its platform.\nGartner Vice President Lydia Leong said that Google is a company that has always had a lot of promise as a public cloud provider, but just hasn’t lived up to it. The company typically positions itself as an innovator, but it’s hard to do that when Amazon is already innovating quickly, and the company’s product catalog isn’t as large as that of its competitors.\n\"I’ve never felt that Google has put the level of effort necessary into this market to be a winner,” she said in an interview.\nWhat’s more, Google hasn’t put as much effort as its competitors into building out an enterprise sales and support force, which is compounded by the fact that the ecosystem of partners built up around Google Cloud Platform isn’t as robust as AWS’s or Microsoft Azure’s.\nDave Bartoletti, a principal analyst at Forrester, said in an email that the biggest challenge facing Google in the cloud wars is proving itself to enterprises.\n\"Cloud is already proven as the best place to quickly build exciting new web and mobile applications, but the next wave of cloud spending will be driven by large enterprises moving significant portions of their applications to the cloud,\" he said in an email. \"To reach these enterprise customers, Google needs marketing, sales, and channels designed to reach big companies, not consumers.\"\nThat change is already in progress. Google hired Diane Greene, the co-founder and ex-CEO of VMware, to take over its business-focused products, including the cloud platform, and she has been pushing to improve the company’s standing with enterprises.\nJack Clark at Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the company is working on growing its enterprise sales channels, and that cloud chief Diane Greene took part in a recent customer meeting with partner SADA Systems. SADA’s CEO reportedly said that was the first time a Google executive of her stature has done so in nine years.\nIf Google can better pitch its services to enterprises and build out additional products, it has tremendous potential behind it. Quizlet, a San Francisco-based education startup, moved all of its infrastructure over to GCP.\nThe company’s pricing schemes (which avoid long-term contracts in favor of discounts for continued use) played a role in Quizlet's decision to move from Joyent, but Quizlet Platform Lead Peter Bakkum said that the ultimate decision came down to a belief that Google’s core technology is better than that of the competition.\nBakkum’s confidence is a key sign of what could be in Google’s future. Urs Hölzle, its senior vice president for technical infrastructure, expects the company’s public cloud business to overtake the advertising revenue that makes up the overwhelming majority of the money Google makes.\nWhat remains to be seen is if the company can live up to that prediction.\n", "deleted" : false }

So it's interesting to see Google go in an entirely different direction.\nEmail a friend\nUse commas to separate multiple email addresses\nFrom\nYour message has been sent.\nSorry\nComputerworld | Feb 15, 2016 10:27 AM   PT Like this article? thumbsup +2 thumbsdown\nRELATED TOPICS\nComments\nA quick intro to the cloud. In the beginning, there was no cloud and all software was on-premises and infrastructure sat on physical boxes. Then Jeff Bezos and Marc Benioff (Amazon and Salesforce CEOs, respectively) in their infinite wisdom invented software as a service ( SaaS , in the case of Salesforce) and infrastructure as a service ( IaaS , in the case of Amazon's Amazon Web Services business unit).\nThe world would never be the same. Suddenly, organizations could acquire technology on demand and priced in an \"as you consume\" manner. Excitement abounded.\nBut technology stacks often have three components, and there was a world of people who didn't really benefit from either SaaS or IaaS. I speak of the developers, not the people who want to use actual software nor those who want to manage servers, but those who write code for others to use and yet others to manage. These developers needed platforms that packaged up all of the stuff they normally had to worry about -- scaling, load balancing, etc.\nAnd so the smart folks at Heroku and Engine Yard invented platform as a service ( PaaS ). While it is debatable who invented it (Benioff would likely claim he did as part of Salesforce), the reality is that it doesn't matter. We now live in a world with three -as-a-service layers: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.\nFor a two-minute visual explanation of the stack, enjoy yours truly in the (slightly dated, but still largely accurate) video here .\nFast-forward to today and Cloud Foundry seems to be enjoying the biggest recognition and industry buy-in for PaaS. True, other PaaS offerings exist (Microsoft has PaaS-like offerings in Azure, Heroku still exists within Salesforce, EngineYard is still a player and Oracle goes to great pains to explain that it has PaaS services), but for the most part, Cloud Foundry seems to have stolen much of the thunder of PaaS.\nApart from a pesky open-source project out of Red Hat: OpenShift . OpenShift has managed to overcome the not-insignificant fact that every man and his dog is talking about Cloud Foundry, and has built a small but significant and loyal following for its platform.\nWhich seems to have paid dividends if some news out of Google last week is anything to go by. It seems that Google and Red Hat jointly announced that they're working together to deliver OpenShift to the Google public cloud. Sometime \"in the coming months,\" storage and analytics services currently offered by Google 's Cloud Platform will natively work with OpenShift.\nThe flavor of OpenShift in question, OpenShift Dedicated, is a new offering that Red Hat launched last month. Somewhat confusingly (given its name), it allows organizations to run OpenShift, not on their own on-premises infrastructure as was usually the case, but on public clouds such as Amazon Web Services. And now, Google.\nOn the one hand, we could see this as an unimportant announcement that means little to either party beyond some co-marketing. But Google is smart, and it just hired one of the smartest executives in the business: Diane Greene, co-founder and former (deposed) CEO of VMware.\nGiven that OpenShift supports both Docker and Kubernetes, a Google-backed open-source project, this looks like a good fit. And given Greene's goal to start chipping away at the massive lead that AWS has in the public cloud, it could just about be game on.\nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

When it was still in private beta, we wrote that Nuconomy was approaching analytics in a new way to try to put more meaning into the data that is thrown back at users, meaning that in many ways it will be more useful than even those hugely expensive alternatives.\nThe tool set is designed specifically for publishers, advertisers and users to better understand and engage with the social web. The platform boasts a data mining engine which continually monitors every aspect of site traffic and user behaviors and automatically highlights the most important things for companies to act on. The main goal is to make web analytics reporting proactive and shorten the time between aggregating and analyzing data, drawing conclusions and taking actions based on the collective intelligence.\nNuConomy’s innovative metrics measure the social elements of digital media, including Flash, AJAX, and Silverlight applications, along with page views, unique visitors, and other traditional metrics. NuConomy also features a two-way API that dynamically changes sites based on current metrics and insights, including the ability to show ads or push specific content relevant to a user’s interests.\nNuConomy was founded in 2006 in Tel Aviv, Israel and is now headquartered in San Francisco, California. Its executive team is comprised of former Microsoft and Google leaders.

There are more than 325,000 apps available for iOS devices. Even the fledgling Windows Phone 7 app marketplace already has greater than 5,300 apps . Throw in the wide world of web applications and, forget about it: you'd need many lifetimes to try them all.\nHowever, there are just 10 apps you really should keep a very close watch on in 2011. The list below represents the 10 applications — for mobile and the web — that Mashable editors think will be worthy of your attention in 2011. Let us know in the comments which of these picks you agree or disagree with, and which applications you're excited about for next year.\n1. The Daily\nThe Daily is the News Corp’s iPad-only newspaper that is set to launch in January with each daily edition costing $0.99 to download. News Corp has invested a lot resources by hiring some 100 journalists and attracting top talent . Rupert Murdoch is trying to reinvent the daily distribution model and move it to the iPad. Because it’s such a big investment and features original content for the iPad, it will be an app to watch.\n2. Ge.tt\nSince Drop.io was purchased and disbanded by Facebook, there’s certainly a need for free, web-based, acount-less and super simple file sharing. Ge.tt’s unlimited file size allotment, temporary URLs and elegant design make it a good candidate to fill Drop.io’s shoes - that is until Facebook or Google finally build something more powerful.\n3. GetGlue\nGetGlue is one of the few checkin apps that offers something the other major players (i.e. Foursquare, Facebook Places, Gowalla, SCVNGR, Loopt, etc.) don’t: checkins for activities performed mainly in the home. It also has one of the best recommendation engines I’ve come across. There’s considerable incentive for brands to partner here, which should bring GetGlue into the mainstream the way (if not to the extent) that Foursquare was brought in in 2010.\n4. Bizzy\nFledgling startup Bizzy relaunched its website in 2010, focusing on customizing local recommendations based on a user’s favorite locations. In December, it also relaunched its iPhone app that enables users to find nearby recommendations on a simple Google Maps integration. The Bizzy team has more functionalities in store for us in 2011, which may make it as useful for finding local places to visit — if not more so — as Yelp, Google Maps and Foursquare.\n5. Flipboard\nLaunched earlier this year as the iPad’s social magazine, Flipboard transforms social and news feeds into an interface nothing short of gorgeous, but the company and its founder Mike McCue have far bigger plans as they try to reshape news and journalism. Watch out for some big moves in 2011.\n6. Kik\nKik is like BBM, but it works across iPhone and Android phones, which makes it infinitely more useful for staying in touch with friends. It’s a free, instantaneous alternative to text messaging that also allows users to see when their messages are received. No wonder more than 2 million people downloaded it within the first three weeks of its launch.\n7. ShopKick\nAlthough it currently lacks the consumer awareness or social utility of Foursquare or Facebook Places, Shopkick might have the most commercially viable model in the checkin space. Coupons are a concept that the mainstream inherently “gets” and wants. Retailers want to offer location-based programs that are verifiable (and Target and Best Buy have already signed on). And the ubiquity of smartphones will only increase. All of that leaves Shopkick in a position for a breakout year.\n8. Path\nWith obile photo sharing becoming more popular and Path’s focus on being a personal network , and setting a limit to the number of connections you can add, will attract users looking to connect with their real-life connections. Also, focusing on mobile is smart, considering more users are now checking social networking sites on their mobile phone than e-mail. The founding team also has some star power with the likes of former Facebook senior platform manager Dave Morin, Macster co-creator Dustin Mierau and Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning.\n9. Instagram\nInstagram made a big splash in 2010, having created the first (successful) social photo experience for the iPhone, and thus making it a likely acquisition target in 2011.\n10. GroupMe\nIf you think SMS is exploding, wait until you see what happens in 2011. Phone calls are going the way of the dinosaur for the less intrusive and more manageable stream of texts coming to our smartphones. GroupMe is poised to bring group texting to the masses with its $9+ million funding round and rapidly growing user base.\n", "deleted" : false }

This looks like it is the latest in a series of talent acquisitions by the social giant. Before its exit, Drop.io had $9.95 million in funding, led by RRE Ventures.\nFrom the Drop.io blog :\n“Today, we’re proud to announce that we’ve struck a deal with Facebook.  What this means is that Facebook has bought most of  drop.io ’s technology and assets, and Sam Lessin is moving to Facebook.\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be winding down the  drop.io service. As of this week, people will no longer be able to create new free drops, but you’ll be able to download content from existing drops until Dec. 15. Paid user accounts will still be available through Dec. 15 and paid users will be able to continue using the service normally.  After Dec. 15, paid accounts will be discontinued as well.”\nDrop.io allowed users to exchange files or “drops” privately with their friends through web, email, or phone. The company will be shutting off all accounts after December 15th.\nAs this has all the markings of an acqui-hire, founder Sam Lessin will be joining the Product Management organization at Facebook, where his fellow Harvard alumnus and friend Mark Zuckerberg is CEO. We’ve got no word on what will happen to the rest of the team.\nFrom Facebook, “We can confirm that we recently completed a small talent acquisition for Drop.io and acquired most of the company’s assets. We’re thrilled that Sam Lessin will be joining us at Facebook.”\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

The outlook? Unclear.\n@caro\nPath.com has quite the vantage point from its San Francisco offices. Caroline McCarthy/CNET\nSAN FRANCISCO--The offices of Path float 40 stories above the city in one of the upper floors of a residential tower just a block away from the waterfront, where the hallmarks of a young start-up--fridges of Red Bull, whiteboards awash in colorful scribbles, the glow of massive Mac desktop monitors--colonize what would normally be coveted apartment space for one of San Francisco's most financially fortunate. There's a balcony with sweeping views of the Bay Bridge and the waters underneath, where on this sunny fall afternoon a lone kayaker in a bright-orange craft flits around uncomfortably close to industrial boat traffic.\nSafely tucked away from the chattering, eavesdropper-friendly office spaces, neighborhood coffee shops, and bars where most San Francisco start-ups take root, Path's headquarters have a feel of forced remoteness and above-the-fray distancing. This is appropriate for Path itself: launching tonight after a deliberate attempt to stay in \"stealth mode,\" Path is a mobile application that tries to carve a space for itself in the increasingly public world of share-everything social media by offering a service that its founders say is intended to be thoroughly private and intimate.\nPath co-founder Dave Morin is best-known for having orchestrated and marketed the launch of its developer platform. Dave Morin/Facebook\nBefore hearing about Path it helps to know a bit about its founders. One co-founder, Shawn Fanning, became a poster child for the Digital Age well over a decade ago as the founder of Napster (no, not the co-founder who was played by Justin Timberlake in \"The Social Network\") and the other, Dave Morin, was one of Facebook's most visible employees several years ago as he oversaw the launch of its groundbreaking developer platform. When Morin departed Facebook in January , leaving behind a far bigger, more powerful company than the one he'd joined late in 2006, he said he'd be working with Fanning on a new start-up. At the time, they didn't know what they'd be doing; they toyed with a few possible products before settling on the final idea.\nSo this is Path: it's a sort of hybrid of the mobile photo-sharing apps that have generated such a craze lately, and the private, on-the-fly group messaging services that promise an alternative to communicating in a huge social network. You share photos in a stream called a \"path,\" but you can only share your \"path\" with a total of 50 people, and those 50 people must be pulled out of your iPhone's contact list. ( Android and BlackBerry versions are on the way.)\nYou can tag each photo--with people, with a place, and with a \"thing\" in it. The entire item is what Path calls a \"moment.\" There are some unique quirks to the service: the list of contacts you see in Path isn't the people with whom you share your \"path,\" but the people who have opted to share with you, a marked (if potentially confusing) contrast to the voyeuristic world of Twitter. When you tag a \"thing\" in a Path \"moment,\" you can type in anything but are also offered a list of other things that have been tagged nearby as well as at similar hours of the day.\nOn this mid-afternoon in early November in the offices of a start-up with some of the sweetest views that San Francisco has to offer, Path tags that pop up include \"epic sunset, hacking, Guy Fawkes, blue skies, launch night.\"\nAll in all, it's like a more tightly restricted Instagram , minus the artsy camera filters, but Morin insists that this kind of structure--tag this way but not that way, share with only this small group--isn't forced. Rather, he says, he's tapping into a natural desire to share details of the intimate and mundane that blossom early in a social-sharing service's lifespan--think back to the heyday of LiveJournal, or the community of photographers who flocked to Flickr, or the pre-celebrity era of Twitter--which typically erode as the amount of public content escalates, and along with it, the noise. He hopes that the unusual structure of Path will mean that those moments of quality and intimacy don't degrade.\n\"We were really interested in sort of trying to figure out a way to create something intimate on mobile that all consumers would like,\" Morin explains on the afternoon when CNET has dropped by for a demonstration of the still-stealthy Path. The 30-year-old presents his new company in a way that's nuanced and almost academic in comparison to the big, isn't-this-awesome onstage pitches he used to make to developers and press for Facebook Platform. He's sitting in a sparse conference room decorated only by two sunflowers floating in flat, square vases on the table.\nThe soaring views of San Francisco Bay are out the window to his left, but behind a pair of wire-frame glasses, his vision is focused, undistracted, on the iPhone 4 in his hands. Scrolling through the Path app, he talks about philosophy and sociology, the books and research he's read, and the observations that he gleaned from his choice perch at Facebook that, oftentimes, even the millions of users themselves may not have realized.\n\"A lot of what we've built at Path is based on two peoples' research, Robin Dunbar and Daniel Kahneman,\" Morin said, name-checking the anthropologist of Dunbar's-number fame as well as the Nobel-laureate psychologist whose work in \"hedonistic psychology\" offered new insights into our perceptions of happiness. \"We have two selves, a 'remembering' self and an 'experiencing' self, and they both are happy in different ways,\" Morin explains. \"We've tried to build a product for both selves...there's a lot of experiencing in this version but there'll be a lot of remembering coming in the future.\"\nThe distraction-soaked Web may prefer a simpler description, like that Path is a way to share photos of your cat with the people who actually would be interested in seeing photos of your cat. \"I love mochas. My friends know that. My close friends know how much I love going to The Grove and having mochas,\" Morin says, referring to the mini-chain of coffee and sandwich shops that freckle San Francisco's caffeine-friendly landscape. \"That moment on the broader social Web is probably not that interesting.\" The challenge, of course, is dealing with the immunity that has set in for millions of people who can no longer see a reason why their photographs of cats and mochas shouldn't be public. Convincing people that they need something when it isn't immediately evident isn't easy.\n\"If users want to share their photos with other networks, if they want to put them on Tumblr or Twitter, they're perfectly welcome to and we'll likely build those interfaces. They're not in version one, but we'll likely build them in,\" Morin said. He pauses and smiles. \"We don't want to stop those people.\"\nMissing from the room that afternoon is Fanning; he's in New York, where Morin had been as well until the prior day. The former Napster founder keeps a low profile, occupying \"sort of a chairman role\" and not making many appearances surrounding Path's launch, Morin said. Instead, taking his place in the conference room with Morin is Matt Van Horn, the company's vice president of business development . Eventually, they say, they want to put together a revenue strategy of premium features and possibly brand partnerships, but for now that isn't the priority.\n\"I'm not doing day-to-day business deals, per se, but right now I'm kind of doing anything, from anything related to fundraising to business operations to recruiting to marketing strategy, but relationships-wise--working on that stuff,\" Van Horn said.\nGiven Fanning's and Morin's tight connections in Silicon Valley, Van Horn's job has probably been made a bit easier. The company has raised a seed funding round of $2.5 million from Baseline Ventures, Index Ventures, First Round Capital, Betaworks, the Founders Fund, and a marquee list of angel investors like Saleforce's Marc Benioff; former Facebook execs Matt Cohler, Dustin Moskowitz, and Chris Kelly; Digg founder Kevin Rose; actor Ashton Kutcher; Drop.io founder Sam Lessin; and FriendFeed founder Paul Buccheit.\nIt's on the verge of moving into new office spaces, too, to another nearby tower with waterfront views. It's a bi-level office space; at 14 employees, they won't fill it up at first, but say there's room for a year or two's growth.\nThey say they want to be set up for the long haul. \"I think we're building toward the trend,\" Van Horn says. \"In 2013, there'll be more mobile Internet users than desktop Internet users.\" Morin jumps in and talks about how he aims for \"slow growth,\" for giving the company and the community that they hope will bolster it some room to breathe, to unfold, to carve out its own path. Facebook itself, after all, had its roots in the austere, minimalist, and highly restricted before Morin's project, the Platform, flung the social network's meshwork of connections open to the Web at large.\n\"Every choice we've made has been intentional to build a 30-year brand,\" Morin says, pointing out the fact that they went through \"a lot of negotiations\" to buy the domain Path.com from a real estate developer who'd owned the domain for well over a decade.\nThey don't know what things will be like in 30 years, of course, or even 30 days. But here is this moment, for Path, right now: the people are a prominent founding team, big-ticket investors, and a community that has yet to form. The place is a highly competitive market flush with existing competitors, future imitators, and the temptation to cash out early rather than fight for lasting success. The \"thing\" that's taking over this moment, meanwhile, is the pervasive sense of being watched.\nBeginning at a highly visible vantage point at the top of a tower dozens of stories above the world capital of digital media, the path of Path is paved with expectations. And, the doors back into stealth mode now firmly shut behind them, the company's founders don't have the luxury of keeping their own \"path\" restricted to 50 people.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

New York's attorney general,  Eric Schneiderman says investigators found abuses in sales of  concert and sports tickets that prevent consumers from buying  affordable tickets or sometimes even getting them at all,  Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016. (AP Photo/Hans Pennink,  File) syndication.ap.org\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Had a hard time getting a ticket to a concert  or sporting event? New York's attorney general says that's  probably because more than half of tickets to many events are  held for industry insiders or otherwise unavailable to the  general public.\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a report released  Thursday that his investigation of the industry was prompted by  consumer complaints, which his office receives regularly.\n\"Ticketing, to put it bluntly, is a fixed game,\" the report said.  Investigators found abuses and practices that prevent consumers  from buying tickets at affordable prices or sometimes even  getting them at all.\nInvestigators found that third-party brokers resell tickets on  sites like StubHub and TicketsNow at average margins of 49  percent above face-value and sometimes more than 10 times the  price. Some brokers use illegal specialty software, called  \"ticket bots,\" to quickly purchase as many desirable tickets as  possible for resale at significant markups, they said.\nThe report cited a single broker buying 1,012 tickets within one  minute to a U2 concert at Madison Square Garden when they went on  sale on Dec. 8, 2014, despite the vendor's claim of a four-ticket  limit. By day's end, that broker and one other had 15,000 tickets  to U2's North American shows.\nMadison Square Garden is \"well aware of the issue of tickets  getting into the hands of brokers\" and has been working to  address it, spokeswoman Kimberly Kerns said. \"While there are no  obvious solutions, we continually look for ways to avoid selling  tickets to brokers,\" she said.\nVenues and sellers like Ticketmaster regularly tacked on fees  that added more than 21 percent to the face value, investigators  said. They found that on average, 16 percent of tickets are  reserved for various industry insiders like the venue employees,  artists and promoters, while 38 percent are reserved for presales  to certain groups like holders of a particular credit card.\nTicketmaster did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThe report also criticized \"price floors,\" particularly by sports  leagues and teams including the NFL and New York Yankees, which  are rules meant to prevent tickets from being sold below their  face value and that deprive the public of possibly cheaper  tickets. Many NFL teams encourage or even require ticket holders  to use Ticketmaster's NFL Ticket Exchange platform, where the  seller is prohibited from cutting the price.\n\"The more aggressively sports leagues and individual teams push  ticket buyers and sellers to use their 'official' secondary  markets, the more serious this problem becomes,\" the report said.\n\"This investigation is just the beginning of our efforts to  create a level playing field in the ticket industry,\"  Schneiderman said.\nAn NFL spokesman said the NFL Ticket Exchange is just one of many  options for ticket holders to buy or sell tickets.\n\"The NFL does not require them to use the Ticket Exchange,\" Brian  McCarthy said. \"The NFL imposes no restrictions whatsoever on any  fan's ability to buy or resell tickets on other secondary  ticketing sites or to do so at any price they choose. \"\nA spokeswoman for the Yankees said the Yankees Ticket Exchange is  \"a completely voluntary program\" and a small percentage of the  market.\n\"It is however the only place where a fan can be guaranteed a  safe ticket,\" Yankees spokeswoman Alice McGillion said.\nSchneiderman's office is still examining the NFL platform's price  floor and whether it's anti-competitive, said an official with  knowledge of investigation who wasn't authorized to discuss it  publicly and declined to be identified. They want the teams to  remove it, he said.\nThe attorney general also has reached settlements with two ticket  brokers operating without a reseller license. The settlements  require one company to pay $80,000 and the other $65,000. They  and their principals also must maintain a license.\nThe attorney general's office issued a report more than 15 years  ago that found New York's ticket distribution system was largely  underground and provided \"access to quality seating on the basis  of bribes and corruption at the expense of fans.\"\nThursday's report said that despite changes in technology and  state law, the problems persist, and event ticketing is the great  exception to areas of the economy where online sales have yielded  lower prices and greater transparency.\nMore from Associated Press:\n", "deleted" : false }

CEO Bruce Falck Details DSP's Omnichannel Road Map", "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-22T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "content" : "Share:\nLast September, BrightRoll COO Bruce Falck became CEO of the troubled ad tech company Turn . It’s an interesting time for Turn. The company is not a spring chicken in the ad tech world – an industry often rocked by the mercurial whims of investors, agencies and brands.\nSo how can Turn be a stabilizing force both for itself and for clients grappling with channel fragmentation?\nFor Falck, it comes down to three pieces: the data management platform (DMP), the “omnichannel” demand-side platform (DSP) and analytics. That Turn has a DMP that can be separated out from its DSP, Falck said, represents a competitive advantage, especially as brands seek to (wait for it…) leverage their first-party data assets.\n“The notion that programmatic is going in-house is happening with the DMP, but not the DSP,” Falck said. Turn’s brand clients can therefore deploy the DMP on its own, while the DSP sits with an appointed media-buying agency.\nFinally, given that the DMP sits with the brand while the agency manages the DSP, Turn is positioning its analytics platform as the connective tissue between the two.\nThis model isn’t new. Turn notes its first big case is the Kraft-Starcom deployment from back in 2014. But Falck believes it’s unique, noting few other ad tech vendors can provide this type of service.\n“It’s the sum of the parts,” Falck said. “The DMP, DSP and analytics platform is what makes Turn special.”\nFalck spoke with AdExchanger about Turn’s future.\nAdExchanger: So your competitors aren’t doing this at all?\nBRUCE FALCK: Our competitors are doing varying pieces of this. DBM (DoubleClick Bid Manager) has all three legs of this stool, though they’re much newer to the DMP side. I think it’s in alpha or beta testing right now. But outside of the independents, nobody is doing all three legs the way we’re doing it.\nThe Trade Desk and MediaMath have seen substantial growth. How does Turn go to market against them?\nBroadly speaking, The Trade Desk, as the name suggests, is primarily focused on trading desks, and specifically doesn’t go customer-direct. They don’t have the DMP component that’s sold customer-direct. And MediaMath doesn’t have a DMP at all. [Editor's note: MediaMath says it has a DMP and The Trade Desk says it has a standalone DMP, which it sells to agencies.] They’re doing interesting work in the data and analytics side – they announced the data co-op . We primarily run into DMP pure plays like an Oracle/BlueKai or Google, which has the DMP/DSP combination at scale.\nIt’s fair to say that nobody else, outside of DBM, has multiple customers with north of $50 million a year in spend. Some customers are just getting to scale, and that’s when the magic happens. That’s when the revenue becomes really sticky and repeatable.\nHow about going after agency business? Is that a focal point at all or are you zeroing in on brand-direct?\nIt depends on what the brands want to do. They’re driving this more than Turn is. We’ve always worked with agency trading desks. They’re still a key segment for us. We often see partnerships with the brand, the agency and ourselves. I suppose it’s more true of VivaKi at Publicis, where they decentralized off of AOD and the programmatic expertise lives at the agency level. We have great partnerships when that happens.\nWe expect what we call the brand-direct and agency segment to grow north of 30% for Turn in 2016.\nIn terms of revenue, how much comes from brands, how much from agencies?\nRevenue that’s brand-centric will be more than 50% of our business in the next couple of years. It’s a little tricky to answer that question because you have to categorize revenue by whether it was driven by the agency or brand. Usually when it’s driven by the brand, it’s in close partnership to the agency. But when the brand decides to choose its technology and issues an RFP and, at the end of it, says, “We choose Turn,” I consider that a brand-direct deal.\nYou referenced VivaKi. When a trading desk like that gets decentralized, how does that affect your relationships?\nYou have to ask: What was the agency’s strategic intent? [VivaKi’s] strategic intent was to get the programmatic expertise deployed into the agencies. I would agree that’s a good idea. Programmatic will be so central to what agencies are doing in the next five years, they have to get smart about it. You heard Megan Pagliuca [CEO of Omnicom’s Accuen trading desk] at Programmatic/IO talk about how Accuen is headed in that direction. You’ve seen how Brian Lesser, formerly of Xaxis, is now running GroupM. We go from contracting with a trading desk, which is like a one-to-many wholesale deal, to contracting with specific brands at agencies.\nNow, there are folks like Cadreon that don’t subscribe to that model. If that’s how the agency works, we’ll partner with Cadreon, obviously.\nWhat does that do to your sales structure?\nThe evolution has been happening over the last five years. When I was at Google and we acquired Invite Media, it was mostly trading desk revenue. Since DBM has grown up, it’s evolved. I’d say the evolution isn’t driven by Turn, but by brands wanting to get smart about programmatic. This is their future. If you’re a marketer at a brand right now, programmatic is the at the top of your priorities.\nHow has Turn adjusted?\nLast time we spoke, I shared with you that we’d done some restructuring . We merged our pre and post sales together. Part of that was to accommodate this new world where we are working with big brands at scale. Most of our growth is coming from existing customers who are looking to double, triple and quadruple spend programmatically – ideally by consolidating on our platform over the next three or four years.\nAre you hiring?\nI’ve hired about 30 people since I got to the company. I’ve been bringing in the expertise that knows how to talk to brands about video, that knows how to navigate big brands as opposed to trading desks. And I've been bringing in consulting capabilities to help brands with their data strategies. A lot of times, that’s where our conversations with brands start.\nIs that consulting capability a value-add? Incremental revenue? The start of a full-blown consulting service?\nThink of the business model conversation we’ve had. The DMP business is inherently a subscription model. When you sell the DMP with consulting services, that piece of the deal is much more like a software deal. We do a specific implementation for a specific customer. The DSP component is media buying, where we contract with an agency on percent of media. You can think of us as having two business models.\nAs agencies respond to global cost pressures , how does that affect you as a tech vendor?\nA big part of the agency’s job is to negotiate the best rate that they can with their tech providers. I wouldn’t say I’ve seen any change in state from where I’m sitting – at least as it relates to agencies and their cost pressures.\nWhat else has changed since you took over at Turn? And what more do you hope to change?\nProductwise, we have a lot of work toward evolving our UI to make the three components – the DMP, the DSP and the analytics platform – work really well together and seamlessly.\nAnother big focus is video. That’s an incredibly important category for large, at-scale brand advertisers bringing TV budgets online.\nIn parallel to that, we’re doing lots of work on mobile and cross-device. So our platform will allow you to buy video, display and native inventory across all devices.\nTurn had been positioning itself as a video DSP as well, even before you arrived. Now that you’ve checked it out firsthand, what does Turn need to do in video to be competitive with your old company BrightRoll and with TubeMogul?\nIt’s a lot of small system tweaks. We’re making algorithmic changes that optimize for budget delivery on different metrics like CPM or GRP. We’re working on tighter integration with key supply sources to help advertisers scale their video spend. We’re doing work around measurement with the usual suspects, Nielsen and comScore. And we’re doing integration work. We want to be an omnichannel DSP. It’s not really about video or display or native. It’s about reaching a customer wherever he may be and we need video to work seamlessly within our campaign flow.\nWe already have substantial video budgets flowing. It just needs to be a more core part of our offering.\nWhen will video be where you want it to be?\nYou sound like my chief revenue officer. It’s not like we’ll ever declare we’re done in video. We’re making incremental improvements. We’re running budgets today, and we’re already video ready. We’ll be fully mature over the course of this year.\nSpeaking as your CRO, how about mobile and native?\nWe’re in really good shape with mobile. The key feature that everyone is looking for is cross-device. Our approach there is to partner with vendors and not to invent that technology ourselves. So we think about who we partner with and how deeply we partner. But we’re mature and competitive there already.\nThe native side is trickier. Native inventory is not as accessible by RTB, though we’re doing quite a bit of that already. But all DSPs need to think about what they do with API inventory. That’s a second half of the year priority. We’re very focused on video in the first half, and we’ll focus on native in the second half.\nThe vision, again, is to build a platform that lets you buy someone where ever they may be on the Internet, across all channels. That includes plugging into the Twitters and the Facebooks of the world. We have to work with the APIs.\n", "deleted" : false }

(And download any of the past shows here .)\nClips from their interviews are below:\n \n \nWayne Sutton is a partner and co-founder of BUILDUP VC , a Bay Area non-profit that connects, mentors, and educates underrepresented technology entrepreneurs. He is also the co-founder of Tech Inclusion , dedicated to exploring innovative solutions to  diversity and inclusion in tech.\nLooking to create their accelerator/incubator, Wayne and seven other founders rented a Silicon Valley house together one summer.\nThe experience proved to be a wealth of learning opportunities, but one lesson in particular stood out:\n… I learned (from) that experience that if you show that you’re willing to put in the work and the effort, there are mentors and people out there willing to volunteer to help you, but you have to take a risk. You have to put yourself out there.\n…By creating the BUILDUP VC  incubator and accelerator … we’re got into the business of providing education and access. We learned that people were willing to provide us resources, provide mentorships, and open their doors. …It proved to us and our companies that … if you are willing to take the risk of coming to Silicon Valley and work on your startup, people want to help.\nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here .\nDave Kashen is co-founder & CEO of Worklife , a Y Combinator -funded startup whose mission to have everyone love their job. Their first product aims to make meetings more productive. Prior to Worklife, Dave was a CEO coach, leadership trainer and culture consultant to some of Silicon Valley’s fastest-growing technology companies. Previously, he was co-founder of Wellsphere , an online health and wellness company that grew to over 6 million monthly visitors.\nHe faced several challenges with Wellsphere early on:\nWe were a little bit too early in a couple different dimensions so I learned the importance of timing…  \nIn ’05, social networking was not quite as prevalent as is it today. The idea of a social network inside of an organization wasn’t a thing yet so that was a little bit scary and even the linkage between healthy behaviors and saving healthcare costs and becoming more productive and being less absent and all of that, a lot of that research has emerged over the last 10 years. \n(Just as important as the product) we did not pay a lot of attention and we’re not particularly intentional about how we were building the company (and its culture.)  \nWe had this mission. We were both non-technical co-founders so that had its own challenges. We were probably a little bit arrogant in our thinking of what we could create and how we could lead developers to create these ideas that we have.\nWe were also arrogant in the sense of we have this idea of how the thing should work and we built it … This was a little bit before Lean Startup was very popular, so we just built this thing that we thought would work and lo and behold, it didn’t work. …The features didn’t match what ultimately the customers would buy or wanted.\nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here .\n—\nWayne set his sights on entrepreneurship when he was a teen, working in the tobacco fields of North Carolina:\nI remember working in the tobacco field one morning. It was about 10 am, and it was hot, maybe one of the hottest summers that season. It was maybe 100 degrees. … around me, I saw people my father’s age, I saw some family members as well, and people that could have been even my grandfather’s age working in the field with me.\nI understood that this was their opportunity to make money, and in their generation there wasn’t many other opportunities besides farming for them to make money.\nI looked at myself, and was like, “When I get older, I’m not going to be working in a tobacco field.” I wanted my own company. …I wanted to be in charge of my own destiny, and that started my drive.\nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here .\nHe first startup idea had potential, but he gave up on it too quickly:\nIt was going to ESPN before ESPN. … North Carolina is big basketball country, a big basketball world like ACC, Duke, UNC. I met these two athletes … one had a little bit of stint in the NBA, the other one had just graduated college and played overseas a little bit. I was like, “… It’s going to be big. People are going to go online and vote for their favorite athlete and all, post pictures.” This was around 2001.\n… They were like, “Oh, this sounds good and everything, but I’m not sure if this thing is going to work out.” … I bought the domain and started doing events… launched a website, and was doing polls (but his co-founders gave up on it, and so Wayne did as well).\n… The lesson there is that if I believed in the vision of what things could be. … You have to realize that you may be too early, the market may not be ready, but also … there’s benefit in sticking it out. I look at that lesson (and think) heaven knows what could’ve happened if I would have stuck it out.\nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here .\nWayne also spoke about working to increase the number of minorities in tech:\nIt’s not an easy problem to solve. It is not just one thing, -… it’s not just about (a lack of) people in the pipeline, its not just as a problem in terms of biases. Not just a problem in terms of access to technology. (It’s all of these.)\nWe don’t think about that in 2016, everybody doesn’t have a smartphone. Everybody doesn’t have hi-speed Internet. Everybody doesn’t have or is even aware of success stories such as Steve Blank or the process of launching a startup.  \nEven though we have all this information online, not everybody is aware or have access to this, and (on top of this there) is lack of role models … especially for underrepresented entrepreneurs. And it’s a culture issue.  \n…Look at the history of America and what has been the role models or the examples of a way out for a lot of underrepresented entrepreneurs minorities? It has been sports and entertainment, not tech.\nI feel like now we’re beginning to see people focus a little bit more on tech, but it’s not just one thing. It’s all those pieces. …\n…(Silicon Valley) is a network-based system — about who you know … who gets funded, how teams are forms, who gets hired in certain companies, how promotions (are determined) — that is all relationship-based.\nSteve:  You think there is implicit rather than explicit bias?\nWayne: Yes.\nSteve: That’s an interesting … It’s truly an ‘old boy’ network.\nWayne: Yes. \nSteve: Even though the old boys are not very old. \nWayne: No.\nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here .\n—\nRight out of college, Dave chased a dream of being rich, becoming an investment banker. It turned out to be the wrong path for him.\nLong Island, (where Dave grew up, is) a fairly materialistic place and I was reasonably intelligent, so everyone said to me you’re going to be a millionaire. I thought that was what I was supposed to become, and so that kind of got drilled in my head. … The point was to make lots of money and that’s what led to happiness, and that was kind of the mindset for a while.\n…my dad was a doctor, my mom was a teacher. … They were divorced when I was 5, so the distinction between my dad’s lifestyle and my mom’s was very apparent to me. I think that was part of the fuel, but there was no entrepreneurs, no real business people in the family, no finance people, I didn’t know what investment banking was, but there was this really, I think, deeply embedded mindset of like you’re supposed to become wealthy and do high-status things, and that’s how you become happy.  \nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here . \nWellsphere found success, but not in the way Dave had anticipated.\n…We pivoted the company toward what the market wanted, and what our users and customer wanted, but away from my initial vision and passion.\nIt worked in the sense of we built value. We were able to grow really quickly from a very small to 6 million monthly visitors. We found a core distribution model that worked in terms of long-tail search. … but by the time we did, it was no longer aligned with my passion, and the vision of the impact I wanted to have.  \nIn some way, part of the decision to sell the company at that time was because I lost that alignment. I think we could have built more value, had we continued.\nSteve: That’s another great lesson. If you’ve founded something, but find you’re no longer passionate about what you’re doing, it becomes just a job.\nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here .\nThe experience led him to create Worklife and, he said, helped him become a better manager:\nI’m way more conscious about hiring for values and listening for alignment (with the company’s values). … As I moved from (a founder of my own company) into the world of coaching, and training, I’ve worked with clients on discovering their own (personal) values and their company values, then devising systems and processes used to make sure that 1) that they’re hiring for values; 2) they’re actually living them day to day.\nAs a coach over the last five years (I learned) that the way to motivate somebody is to have the situation occur to them as if it’s in their best interest. …. When I talk about values, in part it’s trying to understand, what does this person value and do those things overlap with the experience would be like working here. …\nIf you can’t hear the clip, click here .\nListen to my full interviews with Wayne and Dave by downloading them from SoundCloud here and here .

Photo: Victor J. Blue\nWilliam Hill advertising on Twitch.tv - a popular video gaming website.\nexit\nChildren have been caught in the crossfire of a prominent bookmaker's foray into e-sport.\nBritish wagering company William Hilliam has been advertising heavily on Twitch.tv – the world's most popular website for watching people play video games.\nMinors account for about one quarter of the website's overall audience, while 18-24 year-olds account for an extra 38 per cent, according to US audience measurement company Quantcast.\nWilliam Hill's advertising on Twitch.tv has renewed calls for the creation of national gambling advertising laws, particularly when it comes to targeting minors, instead of the various codes of contact across the different states and territories.\nVictoria's newly appointed Commissioner for Children, Liana Buchanan, said \"children were particularly susceptible to gambling advertising\" and it was important legislation kept pace with changes in digital technology.\n\"It's a concern to see gambling advertising apparently being targeted specially to arrive on the computer screens and smartphones of young people,\" Ms Buchanan said.\n\"We know young people of all ages are using these platforms on a regular basis, and the research tells us young people are particularly susceptible to gambling advertising, so it's important to monitor this approach by industry\"\n\"The digital space and how we use it is constantly evolving so it's important to make sure regulation of this type of advertising stays up to date\"\nWilliam Hill local competitor ASX-listed Tabcorp has long called for changes to Australian gambling advertising.\nTabcorp chairwoman Paula Dwyer said at the company's annual meeting in October that a well regulated gambling industry was in everybody's best interests, and this included \"nationally consistent and clear regulations around gambling advertising\".\n\"The growth in online betting, wagering advertising and the propensity of some wagering operators to push the boundaries has created challenges for regulators and the communities in which we operate,\" said Ms Dwyer.\n\"Last year [2014], there was $89 million spent on wagering advertising across Australia. That was up 34 per cent on the prior year. Our concern is not only that advertising is regulated differently in every state and territory, we also share the community's view that there is too much gambling advertising.\"\nFairfax's attempts to contact William Hill were unsuccessful. The bookmaker is one of several which has started wagering on video games or e-sport.\nAccording to Deloitte almost 150 million people across the world watch e-sport, with the industry's overall revenue leaping 25 per cent to to $US500 million ($663.78 million) in the past year.\nIt is tipped for another 25 per cent revenue jump in 2016, and 75 per cent of its audience are millennials, aged 18-34, Delloite added.\nThe industry's growth has seen a flurry of corporate activity. Online retailing giant Amazon bought Twitch.tv for nearly $US1 billion in 2014, while Swedish media company Modern Times snapped up a majority stake in ESL, the oldest e-sport company for $US87 billion in 2015.\nLocally, resource company Volta Mining has transformed itself into eSports Mogul , which has secured a 10-year licence to operate the online platform of eSports Hero – a New York-domiciled company – across the Asia Pacific region, including China. eSports Hero director Gernot Abl said his children spent more time watching other people play video games than regular television.\nBut advertising on websites is vastly different from spruiking on regular television.\nBen Willee, the general manager of Melbourne-based advertising agency Spinach, said both advertisers and site owners had \"limited control\" on where their ads appeared online.\n\"It would be a complicated process to understand exactly how a particular advertisement ended up on a particular site,\" Mr Willee said.\n\"Depending on how and when they [a site owner] are receiving those ads, they have limited control over who the advertisers are. Basically there is a tool called an SSP, or a sell side platform, and that's a computer that controls what ads they receive from an advertising exchange.\"\nBut an advertiser can override the technology, Mr Willee said.\n\"You can remove specific sites from your campaign if there is a concern they are not your target audience or it may be construed as outside your category guidelines.\n\"It's the same argument that's been kicking around tele forever and a day, if you advertise booze in a sporting match, kids are going to see it. Until the technology gets better, they are going to have that limited control.\"\nNevertheless, the Victorian government is concerned about the prevalence of gambling advertising in the community, particularly when it comes to children and young people.\n\"This is a complex issue which crosses borders and we need to start having a national conversation about how to best tackle this issue,\" a government spokeswoman said.\n", "deleted" : false }

The round was led by MDV-Mohr David Ventures with participation from General Catalyst Partners, the lead investor in the company’s Series A Funding announced in early 2007. The company plans to use the additional funding to fuel expansion and growth. In conjunction with this funding, Bill Ericson, a managing partner of MDV, will join the company’s board of directors.\n“Visible Measures is a world-class team with a unique culture delivering innovative technology focused on solving critical problems in Internet video publishing and advertising,” said Ericson. “We are excited to partner with Visible Measures because we were impressed with the team’s ability to develop and bring to market solid, scalable, easy-to-use technology while also providing top-notch customer service.”\nReflecting its commitment to help both video publishers and video advertisers understand and grow their Internet video audiences, today Visible Measures also announced the acquisition of Vidmeter, an Internet video distribution and analytics company that manages universal upload, syndicated tracking and rankings of user-generated video content. Visible Measures plans to invest in and integrate Vidmeter’s technology assets during the first half of 2008.\n“While consumer demand for Internet video continues to grow unabated, the revenue generation engines are just beginning to get started,” stated Brian Shin, founder & CEO of Visible Measures. “Our solutions help video publishers and video advertisers better understand, and hence value, their online viewing audiences. Our philosophy has been to listen to our forward-thinking customers and partners and to be highly responsive to their needs with the goal of delivering the industry’s first end-to-end audience behavior measurement system. We believe that our initial customer traction and recent financing help to validate our approach.”\n“Consumers love Internet video, but the medium and audience fragmentation hinder monetization,” stated Anton Denissov, an analyst with the Yankee Group. “Advertisers and publishers need new tools to tell them how and what consumers like to watch and where to place the ad to maximize consumer engagement and ad revenue.”\nIn related news, Visible Measures today also announced the general availability of VisibleSuite, the company’s flagship solution that helps video publishers and advertisers understand and grow their online viewing audiences. The company unveiled VisibleSuite at DEMO 08, a semi-annual conference that highlights emerging technologies and new products.\nAbout Visible Measures\nVisible Measures specializes in measuring the consumption and distribution of Internet video.

Kontera doesn’t specify what it’ll do with the dough, just saying it will fuel growth.\nMeanwhile, IGA Worldwide, the in-game advertising company, has brought aboard Intel Capital as an investor.

Thanks to its coverage of the Arab Spring, Al Jazeera became a powerful new outlet for news from the Middle East and other parts of the world. Even so, it had yet to reach cable audiences due to a reluctance on the part of big cable distributors to carry the network. That could change soon, thanks to a deal through which it would acquire Current TV — and more importantly, Current’s distribution network.\nThe New York Times reports that Qatar-financed news organization Al Jazeera is close to a deal for Current, which would make it available to a majority of cable viewers around the country. Current might not have gotten high ratings, but it had distribution, thanks to deals it had struck with several of the major cable companies. The network is available in 60 million out of about 100 million U.S. homes with cable, satellite, or IPTV service.\nAl Jazeera, meanwhile, has had a difficult time getting distributors to add its new network to their lineups. Despite years of discussions with cable companies around the country, the international news agency is virtually non-existent in U.S. homes. While Al Jazeera has aggressively rolled out an online presence and video apps across multiple mobile phones, tablets, and connected streaming boxes, until now it has been unable to get traditional pay TV distribution. Outside of markets like New York and Washington, D.C., it simply hasn’t been available to cable viewers.\nThe solution? Acquire Current and use its existing distribution network instead.\nAccording to the New York Times, after the purchase, Al Jazeera would likely rebrand the network and bring a new lineup of its own content in Current’s place. “Current’s schedule of shows will most likely be dissolved in the spring,” it reported, and would be replaced with programming produced both in the U.S. and internationally.\nWhile that means Al Jazeera will finally have an outlet with regular TV viewers, it also likely means the end of the line for Current, which launched in 2005 as an alternative new documentary and news network. While it gained headlines after hiring Keith Olbermann and other left-leaning pundits for news talk programs, it wasn’t able to get the ratings required to keep it a viable alternative to CNN, MSNBC, or the other 24-hour news networks.\nUpdate: The deal has been confirmed. Statement from Al Gore and Joel Hyatt:\n“Current Media was built based on a few key goals: To give voice to those who are not typically heard; to speak truth to power; to provide independent and diverse points of view; and to tell the stories that no one else is telling,” Gore and Hyatt said.\n“Al-Jazeera has the same goals and, like Current, believes that facts and truth lead to a better understanding of the world around us.”\nAlso, Al Jazeera won’t be distributed to all 60 million of those cable households that Current had deals for. Already, Time Warner Cable has said that it won’t no longer carry Current in the wake of the deal being done.\nUpdate 2: Reports are coming in that Time Warner Cable has already removed Current TV:\nWow Current TV has already been removed from Time Warner Cable.

Everything he touches seems only to implode. This happened to E-Trade back in 2000-2002 when he was the CEO. Cotsakos was famously replaced after enriching himself with a $78 million pay package during a year the stock tanked 53 percent (see chart detail at left). He had to give back some of that money, but kept enough to live lavishly in Florida and pour millions of dollars into an ill-conceived social network for international swingers called Moli .\nNever heard of Moli? Don’t worry. It also just imploded. Moli was a me-three social network that was founded in 2006 way after that train had left the station, and didn’t launch publicly until January 2008 at DEMO . The main differentiating factor, if you can call it that, was the ability to show different profiles to different sets of contacts (personal, business, family). The site never got above 2.5 million visitors a month, according to Compete (see chart above). And we have learned from several former employees that most of its staff has been laid off, from a peak employment of about 55.\nThere was a big round of layoffs last September, when all but 15 or so people were let go. Last week, most of the remaining employees were cut loose. The site is still up, but it seems like there are only a handful of people left keeping the lights on hoping for a sale. That is unlikely to happen. We are placing Moli in the deadpool . (And something tells me many more social networks are headed there as well).\nAlthough the company (officially called Mainstream Holdings) reportedly raised a total of $56 million, including $30 million just last January, one source tells us that most of that money was never actually disbursed to the company. And in fact investors from the $30 million round, which included Wall Street billionaire Kenneth Langone and Home Depot founder Bernard Marcus, refused to release the second tranche of funds after the stock market started to go south. That led to the September firings.\nReally, anyone could have seen this coming a mile away: A no-name social network run out of Florida, backed by a guy known primarily for his greed—what did the investors think was going to happen? Oh wait, I forgot, Kenneth Langone is a big believer in greed . The business model, apparently, was to sell deep profile and targeting information to advertisers. The problem was that Moli needed users before it could sell their personal information. The company also sold e-commerce tools to subscribers so that users could try to sell things to their friends. Hmm, I wonder why nobody wanted to hang out there.\nToday, nobody picks up the phone at the West Palm Beach headquarters. And e-mails to company executives, including to president Judy Balint, go unanswered. The site seems to be sponsored by SECFilings.com.\nHere are some screen shots for posterity:\n", "deleted" : false }

The service is expected to launch next week.\n@sandoCNET\nQtrax, the music company that once sought to create a legal file-sharing music service, has finally struck several music licensing agreements and will launch next week, the company said today.\nDetails about the arrangements are scant, but apparently three of the top four labels have agreed to extend Qtrax's former music licenses for three months to allow the company time to try and raise money. Qtrax still owes some of the big labels money and must get caught up before the three-month period ends or lose the rights to the songs, according to one source.\nA company representative told CNET that it will officially launch in 30 countries starting next week, including the United States. The music, which is available in beta at music.qtrax.com , will be free to use and ad-supported. The songs are mostly deep catalog and wrapped in digital rights management.\nAd-supported music sites have a dismal record for generating winning services. Companies such as SpiralFrog and Imeem went bust trying to make it work. Add to the list of hurdles that Qtrax faces is the company's history for just getting out the door in digital music.\nQtrax is most famous for throwing a huge party in Europe three years ago to celebrate the launch of its service, and the company's CEO once boasted that he had struck licensing deals with all the top labels, only to watch label execs deny that any such agreements with Qtrax existed.\nSince then, Qtrax managers have generated a few headlines for promising to launch and failing to meet the self-imposed deadlines . The company's prospects of ever getting off the ground looked nonexistent after it started bouncing checks and getting sued by several of vendors , including Oracle , for failure to pay.\nTry out Qtrax, but I recommend not getting too attached. The fact that Qtrax still doesn't have the funding to secure licensing deals for an extended period suggests money issues continue to plague the company.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

Were that the case, it would be a clear indication of BeachMint’s impending demise.\nHowever, TechCrunch has since spoken with Berdakin, Berman, NEA General Partner and BeachMint investor and board member Pete Sonsini and JewelMint Product Lead David Oh, who tell us that the reports of the company’s death have been greatly exaggerated. In a series of emails and conversations, the founders reported that, in fact, Berdakin and Berman remain 100 “percent committed to and focused on BeachMint” and at no time have been asked to step down by the company’s board of directors. Nor were they asked to return any of the money they’d raised.\nSonsini says that the board is “completely behind the founders” and NEA, which is the largest stakeholder in BeachMint, has invested in each of the startup’s three financing rounds because the firm believes in the founders’ vision. Even if actualization of that roadmap takes time.\nSo, in short: Everyone we’ve talked to at BeachMint says that these reports are completely untrue.\nIn its report, Pando essentially speculates that BeachMint’s lack of traction and burn rate have forced the company into an overhaul reminiscent of the one that recently took place at fellow Los Angeles startup, Viddy, in which it recapitalized and gave back $18 million in funding to investors and reshuffled its board.\nThe BeachMint President tells us, however, that the company has been laser-focused on limiting its burn rate, still has “north of the $20 million [in capital] that was reported” left in the bank and has plenty of runway left. If there is any truth to the story, Sonsini says, it’s that the company has been talking to strategic partners about fundraising. Whether that’s smart or not, well, the truth would appear to lie in the middle.\nIn the big picture, subscription commerce is beginning to enter a period of consolidation similar to the one that the Daily Deal space went through after its gold rush. As the space matures and the big fish (like Walmart) move into the market, some of the “early-mover” startups in the space are going to experience (or are currently experiencing) growing pains. In eCommerce marketplaces (subscription commerce is no different), scale is critical.\nSo, even with celebrity endorsements and early hype, the road hasn’t been a cakewalk, and BeachMint is no different. The company, which began began with a single brand, JewelMint, before expanding to six, features endorsements from celebrities like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (StyleMint), Jessica Simpson (BeautyMint), Rachel Bilson (ShoeMint) and so on, with each brand offering different collections of products in their particular vertical and operating behind some kind of personalized subscription commerce model.\nBerdakin says that BeachMint went in knowing it wanted to experiment with various models and permutations and that, even if each brand didn’t end up a total success, the process would hopefully identify the ideal vertical and model. Going forward, BeachMint likely won’t be able to sustain or dedicate equal resources to all six brands and thus may have to eliminate a couple of these brands in the future. So, it hasn’t just been smooth sailing for the company.\nHowever, while Carney says that the startup’s brands mostly failed to get any significant traction (with the exception of JewelMint and ShoeMint) and that they’ve since been “left to idle,” Berdakin, of course, says that the company is not giving up on its brands and continues to focus on all of its “FashionMints” and within that, he says, to turn more aggressively to a marketplace model, while increasingly on “removing inventory while keeping exclusivity.”\nThe “quality of BeachMint’s revenues continue to increase as well as revenue itself,” the BeachMint co-founder continued. In turn, while he declined to share specifics, David Oh, who leads acquisition and is the head of product for JewelMint, said that he’s run R.O.I. calculations and found nothing in growth trajectory or the company’s margins that even remotely justifies PandoDaily’s conclusion. “That’s why I’m still here after two-and-a-half years,” Oh says.\nThe reporter has also written several articles about the departure of senior executives from BeachMint, which he implies act as corroborations of BeachMint’s inevitable tanking, especially as he claims they were a result of “internal strife.”\nMultiple members of the BeachMint team (including the co-founders) admitted that the company was guilty of scaling too quickly, too early, hiring faster than they likely should have. So, while they confirmed that reductions were made and people were let go, it was because they weren’t the right fit and because it was forced to tap the breaks. While certainly an indication of fallibility, people within the company disputed Carney’s portrayal of the events, which seem to take liberty with certain facts in order to support a pre-conceived conclusion.\n“We are growing 50% year-over-year and continue on path to profitability,” the BeachMint President said and hinted that he and his co-founders were working to draft a response piece that would share further details on the company’s traction, user base, churn and so forth. While founders are reliably biased towards the sunny side when it comes to the success of their business, it doesn’t seem as if this is quite the obituary the initial report made it out to be.\nAs of yet, it is not clear whether or not the board or the company will pursue legal action. But one thing is clear: Wherever he is, Sean Parker just winced and probably grew a gray hair .\nBelow you’ll find the official response from BeachMint to PandoDaily, passed along to us by Berdakin, and below THAT, you’ll find the BeachMint President’s short letter to employees that was subsequently posted to Facebook.\n“The recent article on PandoDaily suggesting that Diego Berdakin and I have left BeachMint and that the company has been asked to return capital to our investors is not accurate,” said Josh Berman, CEO of BeachMint. “Diego and I remain 100% focused and are fully backed by the BeachMint Board of Directors, and there are no plans to make any changes to our leadership team. Unfortunately, nobody at BeachMint or the Board of Directors was contacted to confirm or provide input on this story.\nJosh continued: “We are fortunate that our Board of Directors and our partners are closely aligned and as excited by our company’s ambitions and performance as we are. BeachMint overall has grown 40% year over year, in both sales and subscribers, and we continue to add top talent to our team, including a new General Merchandise Manager for our FashionMints from Kellwood, a Senior Marketing Executive from eHarmony and a VP Finance who joined us from ShoeDazzle.\n“I am more confident than ever that BeachMint will exceed all expectations and continue to deliver amazing product to our customers, and strong performance for our investors,” added President Diego Berdakin\n“The Board of Directors is incredibly positive about the future of BeachMint and we fully support both Josh and Diego in their efforts to build a phenomenally successful business,” said Peter Sonsini, General Partner, NEA, Beachmint’s largest shareholder and a member of BeachMint’s Board of Directors.\n“BeachMint’s business performance, alongside the talented and experienced executive team at the helm, ensures we remain incredibly positive about the future of this company, and the role we know it will play in driving innovation within e-commerce.”\n", "deleted" : false }

Ambitiously, Playsino is setting out to build “the world’s largest social gaming casino platform,” and is naming a new CEO to help lead the way. Brock Pierce, who will be the startup’s CEO, is the managing Director of the Clearstone Global Gaming Fund, and a serial entrepreneur, having founded eight companies and acquired 30 more in various capacities.\nPierce played an early role in the development of virtual goods, founding Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE) in 2001 and Zam in 2003. In addition to new leadership, Playsino is also announcing today that it has raised $1.5 million in venture capital as part of an ongoing round. The investment was led by IDM Venture Capital, a Singapore-based venture capital firm, Pacific Capital Group, Siemer Ventures, and a number of angel investors, including Jordan Simons of GCP and Wicks Walker of W4 Ventures. Existing investor Tomorrow Ventures also participated in the round.\nWith its new capital in tow, Playsino is setting out on a mission to build the largest free-to-play social casino on the Web. Pierce believes that social gaming is at an inflection point, and that social casino games are the catalyst for that movement. Half of the people on the web, or about 510 million, he says, play some sort of social game — a gaming audience that has grown by 71 percent since 2010. With H2 Gaming’s estimate that online gambling could be worth as much as $30 billion globally by 2013, and the U.S. accounting for $4.5 billion of that total, online betting represents a big opportunity.\nSocial casino games have the ability combine the addictiveness of the games that have made Zynga such a big player in social gaming, like Farmville, with the monetization strategies of more hardcore games, which Pierce believes is a dangerous combination. The CEO says that he’s focused on using the startup’s new capital to step up internal development, but that the company also aims to publish relevant third-party content and will look to acquire independent players as well. So likely we’ll see Playsino developing its own casino games in conjunction with building a platform that allows developers and established players to sell their games as well, taking a cue from Zynga.com.\nWhile the space represents opportunity, the big casino and gambling companies are also in the process of moving online, and competition is certainly going to increase. There’s also been plenty of attention from the Justice Department, and as the space moves forward, it’s likely to include a number of regulations to protect consumers — but which may also limit the amount gamers are allowed to gamble. According to BusinessWeek , at least five states have already introduced legislation that would allow people to play web poker against those in other states.\nIt’s a space that’s very much in transition as states consider online gambling legislation, and its evolution may well be shaped by regulatory restraints, but there’s certainly a lot of money to be made in social casino gaming, and Playsino wants to be a part of that. Though it’s still early, the established game companies have an easier road into social casino gaming when they see how the space will be regulated, so the startup will have to be ready with some addictive, quality games if it wants to avoid being stifled by the Zyngas and EAs of the world.\n", "deleted" : false }

In this contribution we present a cryogenic 3D printing method able to produce stable 3D structures by utilising the liquid to solid phase change of a composite hydrogel (CH) ink. This is achieved by rapidly cooling the ink solution below its freezing point using solid carbon dioxide (CO2) in an isopropanol bath. The setup was able to successfully create 3D complex geometrical structures, with an average compressive stiffness of O(1) kPa (0.49 ± 0.04 kPa stress at 30% compressive strain) and therefore mimics the mechanical properties of the softest tissues found in the human body (e.g. brain and lung). The method was further validated by showing that the 3D printed material was well matched to the cast-moulded equivalent in terms of mechanical properties and microstructure. A preliminary biological evaluation on the 3D printed material, coated with collagen type I, poly-L-lysine and gelatine, was performed by seeding human dermal fibroblasts. Cells showed good attachment and viability on the collagen-coated 3D printed CH. This greatly widens the range of applications for the cryogenically 3D printed CH structures, from soft tissue phantoms for surgical training and simulations to mechanobiology and tissue engineering.\nIntroduction\nIn the past three decades, 3D bioprinting has become one of the leading techniques for the replication of real tissue geometries, with the potential to mimic the soft tissue microstructure. Hence, bioprinting is currently the focus of several rapidly developing research fields. Recent applications include printing full human organs to contribute towards the shortage of organ donors 1 . With the development of new soft tissue materials that can be used as printing inks, the field of biological 3D printing has grown exponentially, giving rise to the extrusion of living cells suspended in the printing ink 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . A wide range of bioinks used for 3D printing tissue scaffolds have been summarized in a recent review carried out by and Munaz et al. 7 , although there is no quantification of stiffness past the qualitative distinction between soft and hard tissues.\nIt has been shown that the stiffness of the majority of human tissues lies within the order of a few kPa 8 . Furthermore, in specific cases, cell differentiation and regeneration is promoted in tissue scaffolds that exhibit mechanical properties similar to those of the real tissue 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . Therefore, a 3D printing technique that is able to produce geometrically and mechanically accurate scaffolds could hold enormous potential in regenerative medicine and biomimetics 14 . This reinforces the importance of soft 3D printing. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of studies focusing on bioprinting very soft materials with stiffness O(1) kPa. One of the causes of this is the inability of extremely soft materials to withstand their own weight: the printed structure is usually too soft to hold its shape or allow further layers to be built on top of it. A few methods that have been developed by other researchers are reported here.\nHinton et al. 15 have developed a technique for free-form extrusion-based 3D printing of biological structures (e.g. arterial branches) using alginate, collagen and fibrin gels as printing inks and a gelatine slurry as a support bath 15 . The technique was able to achieve a resolution of ~200 µm demonstrated through the printing of a scaled down human brain using an alginate bioink. However, the stiffness of the alginate ink was reported to be O(10) kPa, and therefore not comparable with that of super soft tissues, such as human brain or lung (O(1) kPa 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ). In another study, Lozano et al. 19 used a RGD modified gellan gum 1 wt% hydrogel bioink with encapsulated cortical neuron cells. The authors were able to demonstrate the ability to print soft 3D cell-laden constructs. However, the printing process was achieved through a hand-held device, hence lacking precision, and the material stiffness was not characterised.\nAdamkiewicz et al. 20 introduced a novel cryogenic 3D printing method using liquid nitrogen. The conceptual idea behind the cryogenic method is that it allows inks in a solution state to transform into a solid state, thus allowing stable structures to be built in 3D using a layer-by-layer approach, without the need for a support bath. However, the stiffness of the hydrogel ink was not reported and the precision of the printing method was not discussed 20 . The cryogenic method was also used to create 2D constructs for implants by Wang et al. 21 , who utilised a substrate cooled by coolant flow to create the cryogenic stage. Again, mechanical characterisation of the printed structure was not reported.\nTherefore, this article demonstrates the fabrication of mechanically accurate 3D printed composite hydrogels that mimic the stiffness of super soft tissues through the use of a novel printing setup based on cryogenic theory. Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) and an isopropanol thermal conductive bath was used to achieve the cyrogenic stage, which is a safer alternative to liquid nitrogen. The ink used in this work is a composite hydrogel of poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) and Phytagel, which has been pioneered by Leibinger et al. 22 and Forte et al. 23 , 24 , 25 to mimic soft tissues, such as brain, with stiffness of O(1) kPa.\nA further advantage of this novel 3D printing technique over traditional cast moulding methods resides in the possibility to produce hollow structures of super soft hydrogels. Interconnected holes make soft hollow structures impossible to extract from a mould using traditional cast moulding techniques.\nThe aims of the study are as follows: (i) to provide mechanical evidence showing the 3D printed material mimics real brain tissue, providing the same response as the casted material 23 , through unconfined compression tests, (ii) to demonstrate the capabilities of this printing technique by achieving hollow 3D printed structures, whose continuity through the layers has also been assessed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis, and (iii) to evaluate the viability of cells in direct contact with the printed material in order to confirm the potential for future mechanobiological studies.\nResults\nCryogenic 3D Printing Technique\nThe resolution achieved by the cryogenic printing method was approximately 262 µm at 2 ml/h flow rate, 5 mm/s print speed. This is demonstrated in Section 2.3 where details of the microstructure of the samples are investigated using SEM. This resolution was comparable to values found in literature by Hinton and co-workers who report a resolution ~200 µm 15 .\nPrinted vs. Cast mechanical properties and comparison with Brain Tissue\nThe results from the compression tests of the printed samples compared to the cast samples are shown in Fig.  1a . The stress-strain curves show a good agreement between the mechanical properties of the samples produced by the two different methods. The average true stress at 30% engineering strain at 0.01 and 0.0001 s−1 strain rates for cast moulded and printed samples are summarised in Table  1 . The average stiffness of the printed samples was greater than that of the cast samples for both strain rates; however, the findings are well within one standard deviation of each other. The viscoelastic nature of the composite hydrogel is also exhibited by the 3D printed method, as the stiffness is greater at higher strain rates, demonstrating strain rate dependency.\nFigure 1\nStress-strain curves of printed and cast 5 wt% PVA 0.59 wt% Phytagel at (a) 0.01 s−1 and (b) 0.0001 s−1 strain rate 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 .\nFull size image\nCell morphology was different for each coating. Cells on the gelatine-coated substrate attained a more rounded morphology. 80% of the live cells observed were well-spread on the poly-L-lysine coated hydrogel, and all cells were well-spread on the collagen-coated materials. Although the cell viability and spreading were similar on both poly-L-lysine and collagen coatings, there were more distinct regions of tightly packed cell clusters observed on the poly-L-lysine coated hydrogel. This indicated that cell attachment was less homogeneous, and the cells favoured a more densely packed configuration than on the collagen coated hydrogel. Cell attachment for poly-L-lysine and gelatine coated 3D printed CH has been achieved with optimized coating processes, which are currently under further investigation.\nDiscussion\nA composite hydrogel, of a composition that mimics soft tissues, was used as the ink material for cryogenic 3D printing. The use of dry ice, which is a safer alternative to liquid nitrogen, in an isopropanol bath to create the cryogenic stage was adequate at providing a sustained thermal sink, allowing the ink to freeze on contact with the stainless steel plate and preceding layers. The thermal energy required to freeze the deposited ink was negligible compared to the rate of energy removed by the dry ice, so new layers were not able to raise the temperature of the plate to the point of melting the material. Up to ~20 mm printing height, the samples were able to freeze upon contact with the prior layer. As the height increased, the time taken for a layer to freeze completely increased, which was taken into account when designing the code for the printer in terms of ink flow rate and speed.\nThe printing of the solid cylindrical samples were very repeatable and failed prints were not common, leading to a printing success rate of 95%. In the remaining 5%, the print failed for obstruction of the nozzle which impeded the deposition of the first layer of material. More repeats were executed to obtain a good print for the 2 layered 3D structure, due to the complex 3D geometry. This was mainly due to imperfections in the printing of each layer. The unevenness was then amplified in subsequent layers as the ink flow was caught on any protuberance in the preceding layer. When plastics are used as ink in commercial 3D printing, the printer is able to smooth down any protrusions in the previous layer to remove this issue. However, it was difficult to apply the same smoothing technique with the cryogenic technique presented in this article as the hydrogel froze immediately when deposited. Once the build-up of material at any point on the printed structure reached a critical level, the print failed. Evidence of this may be found in the Supplementary Information ( S1) . In future, the print quality consistency can be improved by ensuring an extremely constant ink extrusion flow rate and limiting the inaccuracies caused by condensation through improved environmental control.\nThe 3D printed scaffolds demonstrated the concept of using a separate material to support the printed hydrogel to be able to create structures that would be extremely difficult to cast-mould. The support material was water, chosen for its similar freezing point to CH and biocompatibility. The water support did not affect the cross-linking of the hydrogel and, upon thaw, fully intact 3D structures were left once the supporting water had drained away. Owing to the nature of water, no harsh chemicals are required to wash the supporting material away. Therefore, this simple and biocompatible technique highlights the potential of this method to be used in the fabrication of very soft complex 3D scaffolds, which could be exploited for tissue engineering purposes.\nThe low viscosity of the supporting water resulted in a rapid spreading of the liquid before solidification. This reduced the precision of the deposited water and therefore, the use of other materials with tuneable viscosity may improve the quality and should be investigated in future work. A candidate for a support material would be gelatine as it is biocompatible, has tuneable viscosity, inexpensive and removable when heated to a cell-appropriate temperature of 37 °C, as Hinton et al. 15 have shown in their work. An advancement of the cryogenic stage would be to build a setup that allows precise control of the temperature of the plate so that the material may be deposited at a temperature that allows the ice crystals to form slowly so that the nozzle is able to smoothen out the deposited layer before continuing to print further layers on top. Once this has been achieved, the temperature of the plate should be controlled so that only the previous layer is frozen, whilst leaving future deposited material semi-solid. Consequently, the temperature of the plate should be decreased as the printing height increases.\nThe ink used in this work is a composite hydrogel of poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) and Phytagel, which has been pioneered by Forte et al. 23 to mimic soft tissues with stiffness of O(1) kPa. This polymer blend is also able to reproduce the relaxation response of brain over other mimicking materials (such as agar gel, gelatine and polyacrylamide (PA)) 22 , 30 . PVA hydrogel requires a freeze-thaw cycle to form physical hydrogen bonds that crosslink the material matrix. Therefore, this ink synergises with the cryogenic method and provides a simple solution that incorporates the crosslinking of the composite hydrogel in a single step.\nMechanical compression analysis of the stress-strain relationship between the solid samples of printed and cast 5 w% PVA and 0.59 wt% Phytagel showed good agreement, which indicates cryogenic printing is an effective method for the fabrication of super soft hydrogels. The average stress at 30% strain for the printed samples were greater than the cast molded samples by 1.3% and 13.0% at 0.01 and 0.0001 s−1 strain rates, respectively. This result may be due to a double thawing process as the 3D printed samples experienced 1 minute of thawing as they were transported from the printing platform to the storage freezer. During this time, a small degree of crosslinking may have formed, which would contribute to the slight increase in stiffness of the 3D printed samples compared to the cast moulded samples. However, the compression results are within one standard deviation of the average stress.\nFurthermore, the results for the stress-strain curves of the printed samples showed no evidence of fracture between layers, although shear tests should be performed in future to further validate this. The 3D printed constructs exhibited a larger standard deviation from the mean curve, which could indicate that the micro bubbles formed between layers caused by this method have some influence on the mechanical behaviour of the material. The findings demonstrate that the printed material is very well matched to the work published by Leibinger et al. 22 and Andrikakou et al. 18 and hence well matched to very soft tissues, such as brain and lung. Furthermore, the printed material also matches the mechanical response of brain at two different strain rates, hence exhibiting viscoelastic behaviour. By using the cryogenic method, we are now able to 3D print super soft viscoelastic complex structures with a stiffness of O(1) Pa to a precision of O(100) µm, which is an unprecedented advancement in the capabilities of printing soft hydrogels.\nIt is widely known that the histology of real soft tissues, in particular brain, is complex, which makes it difficult to test due to its sensitivity to environmental testing conditions and post-mortem time, among other factors. For both strain rates, the stiffness response of the 3D printed composite hydrogel is within the range of real brain results reported by other authors 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 . Furthermore, in comparison to real brain, the printed CH offers a greater repeatability and efficiency.\nAnother factor which may contribute to the slight increase in maximum stress at 30% strain for the 3D printed material compared to the cast moulded samples is the difference in freezing rate between two different methods. For the 3D printed samples, the freezing rate also decreases slightly as the layer height increases. However, it has been shown in literature that the freezing rate used when fabricating other PVA composite cryogels does not affect the mechanical properties of the hydrogel as greatly as the thawing rate, which is where the majority of the physical cross-linking bonds are formed 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 . Additionally, evidence that supports this is shown in Fig.  2(c)–(f) and in the Supplementary Information ( S2) , where a consistent average pore size across all layers is not greatly affected by the slight changes in freezing rate. A further study on how the thawing rate affects the stiffness of the CH can be found in the Supplementary Information ( S3 ).\nStructures of greater stiffness that can mimic other human soft tissues can also be achieved using the CH as ink. CH offers stiffness tunability by varying the composition of the constituent hydrogels. However, the viscosity of the ink increases when the concentration increases. The viscosity is a critical factor for this pneumatic extrusion based printing method. In future, additive silk particles, which have been used to greatly strengthen PVA without hugely affecting the solution viscosity, should be explored to create stiffer structures.\nFrom the SEM images, the homogenous microstructure of the 3D printed solid structures is well matched with the scans obtained by Forte et al. of cast-moulded CH in terms of pore size and morphology. This indicates that physical cross-linking in the composite material does not occur during the freezing stage since the layers undergo the phase change at different times but instead crosslink during the thawing stage, which is consistent with our knowledge of cryogel physical bonding kinetics.\nAdditionally, images taken of the region across consecutive layers exhibit a clear crosslinking hydrogel network with similar porosity and morphology to the rest of the microstructure at 100 µm scale. This suggests that the hydrogel is able to bond across layers even though the fault line is clearly distinguishable at a wider view of 500 µm. Due to minor inaccuracies in the deposition of the hydrogel ink, micro bubbles of around 100 µm in size are formed, which have been captured in the SEM images. The size of these defects compared to a layer height of 1 mm indicate that the bubbles should not affect the response of the structure on the macroscopic scale, and indeed, the stress-strain curves from the compression tests show that these faults have little effect on the value of stress obtained at 30% strain compared to cast-moulded samples. This, however, might affect the resistance to damage of the printed material, which will be investigated in future studies. Interestingly, the hydrogel network exhibits diffusive behaviour in an apparent effort to mend those tears by crosslinking across the gap. Where the voids are small enough, the hydrogel can be seen to be able to cross-link and branch across the void (Fig.  2 f ). This is a very interesting observation as it suggests that the hydrogel is able to diffuse through the ice as it thaws whilst forming the network structure. This may suggest a self-healing mechanism as it allows the material to amend the errors created by an inaccurate print to some degree.\nCell viability studies on collagen and poly-L-lysine coated CH substrates were carried out to assess the potential of the composite hydrogel and printing method for future use in a wide range of bioengineering applications. Additionally, gelatine coatings were studied, as it is a more affordable alternative to collagen. Cell viability and attachment were excellent on collagen-coated hydrogels. This was expected considering that collagen is widely known as a favourable material on which cells thrive since it provides them with sustenance to grow 36 . Compared to the collagen coating, cell attachment was lower by 26% on poly-L-lysine coated CH. Only rounded cells were found on gelatine-coated samples.\nFurthermore, the poly-L-lysine coating is a very promising alternative as it functionalises the hydrogel through adsorption providing a more robust and durable coating. Cells exhibited a good attachment, although the morphology was slightly inconsistent, with large spreading of some cells and low spreading of others. Small regions of tightly clustered cells were observed, creating localised areas with high cell attachment. Despite this, the poly-L-lysine coating has demonstrated great potential as a coating that greatly enhances the cell attachment of the substrate. It is expected that advancing the adsorption process will improve the homogeneity of the coating and therefore enhance cell attachment, comparable with collagen-coated hydrogels. Future work will focus on improving the adsorption of poly-L-lysine onto the hydrogel, which may be done by using a solution of pH 11 and radiating under UV 37 , 38 , 39 .\nThe gelatine coating was unable to provide substantial results due to the thermal reversibility of gelatine at the incubation temperature of 37 °C, where the coating, which was a gel at room temperature, turned into the liquid state. Nevertheless, further work into the thermal stabilisation of gelatine using UV radiation will be considered in future studies.\nA full comparative study involving an in-depth analysis of coating efficiency has not been performed in the current work since was not in the scope of this investigation. This is a limitation of the present study and will be carried out as a follow-up investigation in the near future.\nDermal fibroblasts were used to evaluate the biocompatibility of the printed constructs. This was a deliberate choice as the cellular evaluation was an initial screen to determine the general biocompatibility of the newly designed scaffold, rather than a specific biofunctional study. Furthermore, considering the wide range of applications of these super soft hydrogels, with great potential for closely mimicking various soft tissues, fibroblasts were chosen since they showed to adapt to various material stiffnes 40 . Moreover, it has been shown by Volckaert and De Langhe that fibroblasts are involved in lung development, and fibroblasts growth factors (FGFs) pathways are crucial for the regulatory fibroblast-epithelial cell cross-talk 41 .\nCollagen has been commonly used as biomaterial for 3D scaffolds in neural tissue engineering, thanks to its versatility, biocompatibility, low antigenicity, inflammatory and cytotoxic response 42 .\nIt has also been shown that neuronal cells are able to survive for more than 42 days and maintained high cell viability in collagen scaffolds 43 .\nAll these evidences pave the way for future in-depth biofunctional studies of our 3D printed scaffolds coated with collagen in combination with various cells types, including neural cells, to determine a more functional ‘tissue-like’ response of the material, mimicking natural soft organic tissues.\nIn summary, a printing technique focusing on producing soft structures using a composite hydrogel as ink has been developed. The current efforts are focused on fabricating complex structures for a wide range of tissue engineering and mechanobiological applications that are extremely difficult to achieve using a cast-moulding method because of their super soft characteristics and hollow geometries. This was accomplished by incorporating a cryogenic procedure. The use of a freeze-plate allowed the CH ink to instantly solidify upon contact with the plate. Each layer was built on previous solid layers and a stable 3D structure was created. This technique integrates the freeze-thaw process required for the formation of physical hydrogen bonds between the –OH groups of the PVA and Phytagel and is therefore and elegant and time-reducing method, owing to the instantaneous freezing step. The crucial factor in achieving successful prints is to ensure the evenness of each printed layer, which should be a key area for development in the future.\nUpon thaw, the material properties of the CH were very closely matched to that of the traditional cast-mould fabrication method, and well within the standard deviation of the samples tested. Moreover, SEM scans revealed that the microstructure of the printed CH was well matched to previous findings of cast-moulded CH in terms of pore size and morphology, further validating this method. The physical cross-linked network was exhibited across different printed layers and formation of bonds across boundary defects, such as voids, suggests a self-healing mechanism during the thawing stage.\nThe use of the CH as an ink in cyrogenic 3D printing opens the doors to many applications that have yet to be explored due to the inability to fabricate super soft materials that mimic the stiffness of brain, lung and other human tissues characterised by a complex geometrical structure. This article has shown that the cryogenic technique used for the fabrication by 3D printing of the CH provides the capability to manufacture synthetic materials of complex shape and good mechanical properties and microstructure. The excellent biocompatibility of the CH with a collagen coating will allow the hydrogel structures to be used in various mechanobiology and, potentially, regenerative medicine studies of soft tissue-like CH substrates, including the future exploration of neuronal cell seeding. In addition, the CH may also be used as a mechanically accurate tissue phantom for surgical training and also for more in-depth and destructive tests that are unethical to perform in vivo, such as impact experiments to study e.g. traumatic brain injuries.\nMaterials and Methods\nComposite hydrogel ink preparation\nPVA (molecular weight 146,000–186,000 Da), Phytagel and deionised water were supplied by Sigma Aldrich, USA. A concentration of 2.5 wt% PVA and 0.295 wt% Phytagel (obtained by dissolving 5 wt% PVA and 0.59 wt% Phytagel powder separately, see below) was used for the ink as this is the composition used by Leibinger and co-workers to match the stiffness of porcine brain up to 95% strain 22 . A detailed descriptions of the constituent hydrogels is provided in the previous work by Forte et al. 23 .\nThe CH ink solution was prepared by dissolving 5 wt% PVA and 0.59 wt% Phytagel powder separately in deionised water for 1 h at 90 °C23. The separate solutions were then combined together in a 1:1 weight ratio and kept at 70 °C under constant stirring for an additional 30 min. The mixed solution was then allowed to cool to room temperature to be used as ink for the printing process, where it remained in liquid phase.\nCast-moulded samples\nFor mechanical comparison with the 3D printed samples, control samples were prepared using a standard cast-moulding technique. The CH solution, which was prepared from the same batch as the printing ink, was transferred into a plastic mould and frozen at −25 °C for 15 hours. The material was then thawed at room temperature and tested. Samples of 10.65 ± 0.16 mm diameter and 6.39 ± 0.26 mm height were cut using a biopsy punch.\n3D printing process\nA commercial 3D printer, Ultimaker 2 (Ultimaker, Netherlands), was modified for the purposes of 3D printing soft structures. The 5 wt% PVA 0.59 wt% Phytagel solution does not solidify at room temperature, thus allowing the ink to be extruded.\nAn extrusion based printing method was developed using needle of gauge 21 (0.514 mm internal diameter) connected to a perfusor (B. Braun, Germany) by PTFE tubing. A stainless steel plate, chosen for its good thermal conductivity of 12.44 W/(mK) 44 , was kept in contact with dry ice, which has a sublimation temperature of −78.5 °C. The contact was kept constant across the plate using isopropanol, with a melting point of −89 °C, as a thermal conductive fluid with thermal conductivity of 0.14 W/(mK) at 21 °C and atmospheric pressure 45 , which therefore remained in liquid phase when in direct contact with the dry ice pellets. The dry ice and isopropanol bath were contained in an insulating polystyrene container, with thermal conductivity of 0.03 W/(mK) 46 , which had an outlet to vent the sublimated CO2. Due to the high water content of the hydrogel, the solution froze immediately upon contact with the conductive stainless steel plate. This solid state allowed a stable structure to be built by means of a layer-by-layer approach. A schematic demonstrating the setup of this cryogenic printing method is shown in Fig.  5 .\nFigure 5\nFull size table\nPrinted complex structures\nTo evaluate our cryogenic 3D printing method for the fabrication of soft tissue scaffold constructs and to demonstrate its precision, structures with complex geometries were printed. Therefore this method also demonstrates the viability to print these complex structures that would be difficult to fabricate by cast-moulding and can be used as cell scaffolds for future mechanobiological studies.\nThe hollow structures were printed based on a cylindrical pore scaffold microstructure, shown in Fig.  3a , suggested by Hollister et al. 47 in order to have the porosity and stiffness required for cells to successfully thrive. A schematic of the 3D structure to be printed is shown in Fig.  3b . These structures were achieved by introducing deionised water as a support material. At the beginning of the process, the CH ink was deposited using the same cryogenic setup described previously. After the completion of each layer, the supporting liquid water was deposited layer-by-layer using a needle and syringe guided by hand. The liquid water changed phase to solid ice when it contacted the printing plate and frozen material from previous layers, thus providing a stable surface. This allowed subsequent layers of CH ink to be deposited on the supporting solid ice layer. Upon print completion, the structure was removed from the plate and allowed to thaw to room temperature. The supporting ice melted away, leaving the hydrogel network intact.\nComplex 2D geometrical structures were also printed and are shown in the Supplementary Information.\nMechanical characterisation\nUnconfined, uniaxial compression tests, up to 30% strain, at 0.01 and 0.0001 s−1 strain rates were carried out on both cast and printed cylindrical solid samples (n = 6). A Mach-1TM mechanical testing system (Biomomentum, Canada) with a 1.5 N load cell (Honeywell, USA) was used to carry out the tests as it is designed towards soft material studies. A 100 Hz sampling rate was used and the data was filtered using a software integrated low-pass filter of order 2 and cut-off frequency 50 Hz. Samples were kept well hydrated prior to testing and immediately transferred onto the machine platen. Each test took 30 s, which is a sufficiently short time to confidently rule out dehydration effects on the samples. Stress-strain curves were plotted and compared for the cast and printed samples to show that the cryogenic technique produces a mechanically similar material compared with the cast-moulded technique.\nThe compressive stiffness was characterised by the stress-strain curves calculated from the axial force and displacement data obtained from the experimental tests. The diameter and initial height of each sample was recorded in order to calculate the true stress and strain. Given the very large water content, incompressibility was assumed for the CH in the calculations; this is also conventionally used when modelling real brain, which the CH has been shown to match in compression up to 30% strain 23 , 48 .\nAnalysis of printed microstructure morphology\nSEM analyses of various features of the printed material microstructure and surface morphology were conducted for further validating the cryogenic printing method. The cross-section of the 3D printed structures were prepared for microscopy using the freeze-fracture method. The surface was then gold-sputtered using the Auto Sputter Coater (Agar, UK) to allow for the conduction of the electron beam and to help preserve the microstructure. An environmental SEM (ESEM) 15 kV laser beam was used with 50 pA in a variable pressure mode of 100 Pa at a working distance of 10 mm. The regions investigated were the internal homogenous microstructure, the bonding between consecutive layers and the sample surface with the intention of validating the cross-linking of the hydrogel throughout the entire printed material.\nCell seeding\nPrimary Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF, Promocell, Germany) were seeded onto the 3D printed 5 wt% PVA 0.59 wt% Phytagel hydrogels, at a density of 4 × 104 cell/cm2. Samples were previously coated with collagen, poly-L-lysine or gelatine to enhance cell attachment. Collagen has been used as a coating for cell attachment by Engler et al. 49 to study the effect of substrate stiffness on cell differentiation, which therefore indicates that the cells have the ability to feel the underlying substrate stiffness through the collagen coating. Gelatine is often used as an alternative tissue scaffold material to collagen due to its greater availability and cost effectiveness. Poly-L-lysine has also been used as a coating as it forms a cationic layer that attracts the anionic sites on the cells surfaces 37 , 50 , 51 , 52 . Whereas the collagen and gelatine coating rely on absorption into the pores of the hydrogel where they crosslink and attach to the substrate, the poly-L-lysine is electrostatically adsorbed onto the surfaces owing to the –OH functional groups present in the PVA and Phytagel chains. This creates a stronger bond that cannot be physically removed.\nCell viability\nCell viability was assessed using Live/Dead staining. Samples were kept in culture for 72 hours and then stained using calcein for live cells and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) for dead cells. Samples were immersed in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, containing 2 μl of 4 mM Calcein AM (acetoxymethyl) and 1 μl of 2 mM EthD-1 for each ml of solution, and then incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C. Live (green, FITC) and dead (red, TRITC) cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope.\nAdditional information\nPublisher's note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nReferences\n1.\nMurphy, S.

As its traditional retail channels moved online, it found it difficult to scale its systems to be able to manage its online growth.\nEnter MuleSource, with its open-source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) technology, Mule. In conjunction with a leading open-source system integrator, Optaros, the two put together a highly scalable services-oriented architecture for Nespresso that makes the coffee drip on time :\nNespresso engaged Optaros and MuleSource to help its corporate architecture team define and implement a new middleware architecture called Nespresso Open Architecture, or NesOA. This new modern architecture is based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles, including fully decoupled systems that support both synchronous and asynchronous integration.\nWith these capabilities, Nespresso's IT infrastructure can now enable new distribution channels, improve business agility, cope with increased transaction volumes, and more easily introduce new applications and services, as needed.\nSounds great, but it's especially telling that the initial implementation took only six months, a testament to the lightweight, open approach that open-source projects like Mule offer enterprises.\nBut open source isn't just a short-term time saver. In fact, its biggest benefits may come from increased flexibility down the road, as Nespresso's Joel Schmitt, an enterprise architect, declares in a case study describing Nespresso's deployment:\nWe are committed to an open-source approach, including MuleSource's Mule ESB, because complying with open standards is key for future extensibility and growth...With our new architecture, we have been able to add flexibility and agility to our system landscape.\nIn this case, Optaros and MuleSource delivered cost and flexibility benefits, but the same types of benefits are being discovered for a wide variety of applications by enterprise IT.\nDisclosure: I am an adviser to MuleSource, and my employer, Alfresco, partners with Optaros.

Consumer oriented threats always take off during the holiday months as well, but apparently end users shopping over their company networks also expose their employers to increased infiltration.\nNew Year's is another favorite time of the year for attacks, with 25 percent of respondents to the Tufin survey saying that the bad guys usually create threats to be launched over the final days of the year.\nIT security pros may take vacations during Q3, but they become lax as the holidays approach , making it easier for attackers to target their organizations, Tufin experts concluded.\n\"Hackers know this is when people relax and let their hair down, and many organizations run on a skeleton staff over the holiday period,\" Michael Hamelin, chief security architect at Tufin, said in a summary of the study.\nAttackers also like to work under the cover of night when IT pros are home asleep, with 52 percent of respondents saying that the baddies typically are busiest during weekday overnights, with only 36 percent focusing most of their efforts during the typical 9-5 workday, and only 15 percent carrying out most of their attacks over weekends.\nThose interviewed at DEFCON said that they also feel that compliance initiatives such as PCI DSS have done little to prevent attackers from targeting sensitive business data, with 97 percent scoffing at the efficacy such initiatives.\nGovernment security directives have also done little to thwart attacks, survey respondents said, as 70 percent said that such mandates have done little to improve public sector security.\n\"These results further validate the reality that there is little common ground between compliance and security, but as an industry we have the collective knowledge and the resources to change that,\" said Hamelin. \"While standards such as PCI-DSS provide a good baseline, organizations that assume achieving PCI compliance will solve their security woes are in for a rude awakening.\"\nMatt Hines has been following the IT industry for over a decade as a reporter and blogger, and has been specifically focused on the security space since 2003, including a previous stint writing for eWeek and contributing to the Security Watch blog.

For more than 40 years, the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation has worked to make a difference by helping to build and sustain the organizations that serve and strengthen Arkansas. Through grant making and strategic partnerships, the foundation is working even harder to help close the economic and educational gaps that leave too many Arkansas families in persistent poverty. After a rigorous software evaluation, the Foundation chose Intacct over other on-premises and cloud solutions as the best fit to meet the needs of the organization.\nPrevious Business Challenges Faced by the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation:\nThe Foundation's legacy accounting product was no longer supported and didn't offer the depth of features desired.\nThe finance team was unable to implement the kind of automation needed to streamline processes.\nThe finance team, as well as management, didn't have consistent access to the system, reporting, or dashboards.\nThe Foundation needed a system that could integrate with their grant management software and other business systems.\nReasons for Selecting Intacct:\nIntacct offered the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation a cloud-based solution that fully supports restricted, unrestricted, and temporarily restricted net assets.\nIntacct will improve the finance staff's reporting capabilities.\nIntacct's open APIs allow the foundation to integrate it with their grant management system.\nHighlighted Comments from the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation's COO and CFO:\n\"Intacct is very robust and its reporting capabilities will be a big benefit to us,\" said Andrea Dobson, Chief Operating & Financial Officer at the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation. \"The AcctTwo team did an excellent job of keeping track of all the balls in the air and following through on key decision points. We've done 3 major cloud upgrades or implementations in the last two years, and this was by far the best one.\"\nAdditional resources:\n", "deleted" : false }

You’re probably not going to throw your Social Security number all over the internet, and for good reason. But most dating apps don’t ask for this kind of information, mostly so you can maintain some semblance of anonymity until you’ve had the chance to vet some people, so you might think your identity is more secure. However, just because your credit card number isn’t on your Tinder profile, doesn’t mean it’s necessarily a secure site.\nUpguard , a company that helps assess website security and the potential for a breach, has completed an evaluation – using their Upguard Website Risk Grader – on the security of the top dating sites. The Grader looks at externally accessible security factors such as whether SSL is enabled, whether cookies are secure, and a other data points to determine the relative security of a site from an external viewpoint.\nUpGuard scores sites on a scale of 0-950, with 950 being the most secure (similar to credit card scores). If a site’s score is low, it suggests that several standard security measures are probably not in place or may not be configured correctly. A high score means the site’s administrators have given thought to web security and may be taking steps to keep your data as private as reasonably possible.\nThe results of this evaluation were interesting. For example, in light of the highly publicized Ashley Madison hack over the summer, the site scored the highest, at 789 . Of course, this site was graded after the breach, so its quite likely that they have significantly beefed up their data security in recent months. Additionally, if the Ashley Madison hack was an inside job, like it is thought to be, this external web scan would not pick up on any internal weaknesses.\nTop Scorers Included:\n", "deleted" : false }

We originally reported on Trusera’s possible shutdown in March, when the startup was nearly out of money.\nFounded by former Amazon exec Keith Schorsch , Trusera launched almost a year ago. Trusera sought to bring users together who were suffering from similar health conditions. The site also took other personal information into account when connecting people, including a user’s hobbies, location, and age. Trusera would then match people up according to all of these factors and allowed users to receive email updates whenever a new match submitted a story or tip, which meant that users didn’t have to worry about constantly searching the site for new information.\nIn the blog post, Trusera’s site manager wrote that the startup had run out of funds and could not sustain operations. Although the site was innovative and had steadily attracted a growing and dedicated set of users over the past year, it was still a small community. The health 2.0 space is a competitive landscape to survive in—there are a number of websites, including Medpedia and PatientsLikeMe, devoted to online forums for people to share their health-related stories.\nAfter the close, Trusera will keep a landing page with information about the site and its mission but will disable all other functionality. Trusera says that the content of site will be secured so that it can be preserved in the event that the startup is able to raise additional funds in the future.\n", "deleted" : false }

Last year, I got to present at a real estate industry conference, where I compared how the MLS (multiple-listing service) players were similar to the record labels and music studios, acting as monopolist gatekeepers to information. And, just as the entertainment industry gatekeepers have attacked disruptive innovators with lawsuits, so too do the MLS operations. In the past we've discussed how they've attacked web upstarts like Zillow and Redfin. The latest is that they've gone after NeighborCity , an offering from a company called American Home Realty Network (AHRN), who dared to make use of real estate data to actually rate real estate agents on their performance. As you might imagine, the real estate agents don't like that very much.\nAHRN noticed that it suddenly received a flood of complaints and cease & desist letters conveniently timed exactly to the dates of the National Association of Realtors's (NAR's) annual meeting in November of 2011 -- and each of the letter seemed to include similar language. After responding to all of the complaints, two separate MLS providers sued AHRN. Amusingly, prior to the lawsuit, an executive for one of the MLS's (NorthStar, from Minnesota) appeared to accidentally cc AHRN on an email to its lawyer, complaining about \"the bad fellow\" (AHRN CEO Jonathan Cardella) not simply bending over and taking down NeighborCity in response to the complaints, and suggesting that filing copyright infringement lawsuits against AHRN/NeighborCity would be useful in bringing a \"world of hurt\" on the company. The email also discusses having various MLSs share the costs of litigation.\nIndeed, NorthStar and a separate MLS, Metropolitan Regional Information Systems, Inc. (MRIS) appear to have followed through and sued for copyright infringement. You can see MRIS's filing embedded below. MRIS repeatedly insists that it holds a copyright on its database, completely ignoring fairly well-established law that you can't copyright facts, and that MRIS's copyright (if there is one) is limited to the creative works it added to the process. Instead, MRIS repeatedly claims to hold a copyright on the entirety of the database. It also claims to hold the copyrights on the photos uploaded by individual agents, saying that as part of that process, the copyrights are assigned to MRIS.\nNeighborCity has hit back with its response (also embedded below), arguing that MRIS has no such copyright, and citing the litany of cases that establish you cannot copyright factual information, relying heavily (of course) on the important Feist ruling in the Supreme Court, which rejected \"sweat of the brow\" arguments for copyright, and said you cannot copyright a collection of facts, such as a telephone book.\nIt seems that the chance of succeeding on such a claim is slim to none. MRIS and its lawyers should be slapped around by the judge for even trying such an argument. MRIS clearly seems to recognize this by trying to use the photographs to make a separate argument. It claims that every photograph that is uploaded has its copyright assigned to MRIS (I'm actually a bit surprised that real estate agents would agree to this...) and thus it also alleges infringement on the photos. AHRN, however, points out that MRIS failed to register the individual copyrights on the photos, instead only registering a copyright on the \"catalog.\" Here, AHRN notes (again) that there is widespread precedent limiting what sort of copyright can be applied to a catalog where little to no additional work was done by the party claiming copyright. Further, it points to the Muench case , which noted the \"the registrant of a compilation copyright must list the names of the authors of the underlying works.\" That's just a district court ruling, so it's not clear how big an impact it would have.\nAHRN also questions the claim that anything it has done creates irreparable harm to MRIS is completely baseless. MRIS's best argument is that outdated info on NeighborCity reflects poorly on MRIS, but AHRN points out that it would reflect much worse on NeighborCity itself.\nThe real issue, of course, is almost certainly that the real estate agents don't like the fact that they're being rated by the site. The fact that NeighborCity has operated for years without a problem... until it put up its agent rating service, makes that pretty clear.\nThe larger issue may be that AHRN is also alleging that the action confirms that real estate agents are violating the final judgment in the antitrust lawsuit the US government filed against the National Association of Realtors. The email that was sent to AHRN certainly seems to indicate plans for concerted action. Combined with the timing correlating to the NAR event... and there's at least a reasonable case for the DOJ to look into the activity here by real estate agents and MLS services.\nIn the end, though, this is the same story we've seen over and over again. Gatekeepers don't like being disintermediated by disruptive innovation. So, rather than adapt, they sue.\n", "deleted" : false }

After reading thousands of pages and scoring them ruthlessly and brutally, the Elites, winners with distinction, regular winners, honorable mentions and a couple of organizations that I’ve singled out for other reasons, have been decided.\n‘Tis the season.\nThis year, 144 companies submitted their questionnaires. I have to admit, I made this year’s scoring a couple of magnitudes tougher than last year – probably the last scoring change for a few more years. So for example there were several companies that would have won last year with the score they received who fell to honorable mention this year. There were several companies (four to be exact) who would have been Elite last year, who won this year but not as an Elite. We welcomed two new Elite winners this year. One company that was Elite last year, got the same score but this year “merely” won. So it was brutal. As nice as I am outside the Watchlist, I’m a total SOB when it comes to the scoring of the Watchlist.\nKnow why? I’m gonna tell you – unless you don’t want to hear it? You do. GREAT! J\nLet’s start with this. I am fully aware of the amount of time that companies put into their Watchlist submissions. Last year I was bragging about how the prior record of 61 pages had been surpassed with a 90-page submission. This year I had 3 submissions that surpassed that with a record submission of 108 pages. I am truly honored that companies feel that this award is worthy of that effort. I don’t want to humblebrag (I do actually) but I am thrilled to death that they care enough. It’s also why I will never charge money to enter as others do. The effort alone is the “charge” for the Watchlist.\nBy the same token, though, I have to read more than 2000 pages and score them each year and then analyze companies doing dozens to hundreds of hours of external research beyond what I am reading with the submissions. I did an analysis of my hours spent and the dollar value given my consulting fees and it would be about $400,000 worth of free consulting. Each and every year. So I am working at this too – because I do think I have to provide value.\nBut providing value is also making the award worth something. Each and every company is evaluated according to the markets they are in, the overall business climate, the strategies and thinking of the customer-facing parts of the business world and the technology world’s rather unique lens. Each year, because that changes, the weight of the questions changes – meaning how important one question is relative to the others given the market(s) and climate and thinking of that particular year. In a lot of ways, I’m preparing all year to do the Watchlist.\nBut make no mistake about it. What I am doing is looking at the impact a company has in the markets it addresses. I’m not doing my analyst thing – and evaluating whether or not, for example, they have the right mission and vision or whether their message is exactly on point. What I am evaluating is their marketing strategy and how well they executed it and what kind of impact it created. I might completely disagree with the message but that doesn’t mean you don’t win the Watchlist. It might mean that when I have my analyst, not my judge’s mouth motoring, I will publicly disagree but the Watchlist is about one thing and one thing only – impact – and what you do to have it.\nImpact award\nThink of it this way. I’m not rating the quality of the product or analyzing the messaging. I’m looking at the actual impact a company has on its market both in the year immediately past (e.g. 2015 for the 2016 CRM Watchlist) and what I can ascertain based on what I am told in the submission and what I find elsewhere for the next two to three years. That means I am looking at this with an eye on the company not its offering. Its offering is only a part of it.\nWhat do I mean by impact?\nWell, for example if your company is top of mind without prompting for a customer when they are making a vendor selection, that means you are having an impact. If your competitors set their compass by you, that’s impact. If you are seen by pundits, press, and practitioners as a leading solution or provider in your field, that’s impact. If you are the subject of brand buzz in external channels that’s impact. If prospects routinely think of you as on the short list for vendor selection, that’s impact. If you are the go-to subject matter experts in your domain, that’s impact. And that’s only a part of what makes impact up. As you know there are 12 questions and dozens of sub-questions within each primary question. The answers in combination (plus several other “they-will-remain-secret” things, commonly called by those with no literary skills, secret sauce) provides me with an indication of how much impact you’ve had and what I think you are going to have. The present and the future have to be, uh, present, for you to even be considered as a possible winner of the Watchlist.\nImpact doesn’t have to be global to win the CRM Watchlist. It can be geographical, for example EMEA, Latin America, or strictly North America. It can be the domination of a category of software or services if the category is more than a small niche. So dominating the sales force automation area, or customer analytics. It can be domination of a vertical industry – e.g. health services, non-profit, public sector. But one way or the other, the impact has to be obvious, both in the prior year and in the anticipated next two or three years. that there is no doubt at all that your company is making a major impression on a market and actually changing or strengthening that market by its presence.\nTo have an impact, the company has to be pretty much a complete company who has been doing this long enough to have established a rhythm that leads to impact. The company has to be well rounded — it has financial stability, solid management, excellent products and services, culture, and a strong partner ecosystem to help sustain its efforts. It has to have a clear vision and mission and also clear-cut strategies to get external forces – customers, analysts, journalists, prospects, etc. – engaged.\nBut it also means that the outreach, the engagement with the market and those in it, the prospects, the customers, the analysts, and the journalists — those who can influence the marketplace — have to be there, too. That takes a complete (and complex) set of tools and activities which could include marketing, outreach to influencers (analysts, journalists), the subject matter expertise via the content produced and distributed for consumption, and the activities necessary to stay top of mind as well as capture share of wallet.\nThat is not an easy task. What does it take? That’s the purpose of the CRM Watchlist and has been since it was created nine years ago as the Steppin’ Out Awards for one of the editions of CRM at the Speed of Light.\nSo what are the segments that have to be considered. To understand that, let’s look at both the process for this year’s CRM Watchlist and the criteria for next year’s – the 2017 CRM Watchlist (see the registration announcement at the end of this post – after the winners list is announced).\nThe CRM Watchlist 2016: the process and the surprises\nI had 131 submissions out of 144 registrations this year. However, the page range and the I read what was roughly 2,000 pages in the month of December and the early part of January. I thought with a submission last year of 90 pages that I had no one would ever beat that. Little did I know. I had 3 over 100 pages and three more over 90 pages. I don’t know the average size but I would guess somewhere north of 45 pages. So I read over 4000 pages this year I think. For more years than I can count, no life again during the holidays and well into this year, since I gave the submitters more time. That is such a first world problem. I know officially know more than Wikipedia about an astonishing number tech companies – okay, metaphorically, not officially. As I have been doing for the last several years, I had asked the registrants to let me know if they weren’t submitting since the minute they registered they went onto my radar so there was a considerable investment in time, with the expectation that they were going to submit to the Watchlist. If they decided not to submit, I understood, all I asked is that they tell me by a specific date. If they did that. No harm. No foul. If they didn’t tell me and didn’t submit they have now one more shot at it. If they register again and don’t submit, and there is no withdrawal for any reason in their case, they are given a permaban. So, that said, to those that did submit, thank you for honoring me. For those that didn’t submit but told me, thank you for telling me. For those that didn’t submit and didn’t bother to let me know even though I had been researching them since they registered and explicitly said not to register if you aren’t submitting, you have one more shot – if you register and don’t submit, don’t ever bother register again. I’ll be letting you know who you are shortly after this post is up. Watch for an email\nMy process is straightforward. I put out the call for registration. I leave registration open until about a month before the submission is due. Then there is a submission date that has no individual extensions allowed. There is a single submission allowed, no updates, so it’s wise to submit as close to the final date and time as the submitting company feels comfortable with.\nAs soon as a company registers, I start to track them. The reason for that is there is a lot of information I need to gather (it varies by company and how much I know them) prior to the submission that will help me corroborate their statements and supplement their submission when the time comes. Over the year, I spend hours with each registrant’s company, gathering info. But to be honest, that’s not hard, because I need to track some of them anyway (they are my clients, or part of my coverage as an analyst) and I like getting to know new companies this way. I started using a tool this year late in the process called RivalIQ , which tracks a comprehensive digital footprint of any companies that have them. They provide detailed reports that give me some insight into the use of digital communications tools. For example, Oracle’s social presence continues to be greater than any other company I tracked though the gap is closing a bit this year from last year.\nOnce I get the submission, I go over every single word and, key to this, the submission is 85 percent of the material I use to derive the score of the particular company. The other 15 percent is the external material I need. This is a metaphorical number for the ratio. It could be 80 percent to 20 percent. The point is that the submission had better be convincing if you want to win. You’d be surprised at the number of people who give half answers to a question and, they are dinged for it. I’m not kidding when I say in the questionnaire that every question has to be answered in full. Theoretically, I should be able to have all the information that I need innate to the questionnaire. But there are a lot of companies that don’t seem to believe me when I say that. Let’s say I mean it, and there is one company that would have won if they had answered the specific questions within one of the primary questions. But they didn’t and thus they didn’t.\nAs I said above, the scoring is done with weighted criteria. Each year, depending on the market, the scoring weights change. For example, in years of financial uncertainty (think 2008), the financial stability of a company is weighted higher than normal, though, of course, it is always important. Some years, they are remarkably flat. This year there were a couple of more emphasized and less emphasized areas than last year. It wasn’t totally flat.\nOnce the scoring is done, the result is “automated”, meaning I have a spreadsheet that sees the score and color codes the number. The resulting color code shows me whether the company was an elite, a winner with distinction, winner, an honorable mention, or didn’t place this year, based on the rules. Winner with distinction is a new category for companies that just missed (and I mean just missed) elite status but because it was so hard to even get honorable mention this year, deserved a “plus” status of some kind. This year, honorable mention is more meaningful than ever too. It means that the company that got it, while didn’t win, did score enough in some places to show that they are poised for breakout.\nFollowing the scores, there is the “and the winners of the 201X CRM Watchlist are…” announcement. That same post has the criteria used for this and next year in it, so I would carefully read it (this post in other words) if you have ANY interest in the CRM Watchlist any year. Over the next few months, I will write the reviews of each and every winner (not honorable mentions)- and for my own and your convenience I lump them into categories. But to reiterate something that I seem to have to reiterate every year, there are no categorical winners. The categories are conveniences that allow me to group winners who do similar things. That is all. This year, I had a company who claimed in their submission, they were the winners in the customer engagement category in their submission. They had been winners but they didn’t win the category because there isn’t any winner by category!! Get it? NONE. Let’s say they lost points for that. Because it means they can’t follow multiply repeated instructions – and are making a false claim.\nThe reviews are written with two things in mind. Describing why this amazing company won – and what they can do better. I often say that this has got to be the only award that vendors fear winning. It’s basically, “Hi, you win and here’s what’s wrong with you!”\nAs always, there were some surprises. Less winners than usual. A new Elite or two. A few new winning companies – and a handful of companies that I thought would win that didn’t. And a couple who had won in past years, lost and came back. You’ll see that when you see the list.\nOne other thing and we can move on.\nIf you are a company that submitted your questionnaire and didn’t win or dropped a notch or whatever, you have the right to ask me for time to explain why you didn’t do as well as you thought you would. We’ll figure out a 30-minute time slot that is amenable to both of us and we’ll have that discussion. because I know that you worked hard to submit what was likely a comprehensive answer. However, the big caveats on this are that it will only happen after all the reviews are done and you’ll only get the answers I can give you without exposing some of the criteria I keep to myself. And to be entirely candid, while the time will be amenable to both parties, it will be more at my discretion. Sorry for the rules, but I’m one person and I want to accommodate as many as I can who request it. So there have to be limits. Each year about 10 companies take me up on it – give or take a few.\n2016 CRM Watchlist notable ‘trends’ and observations\nAs always, certain things stood out when you looked at the cumulative submissions. I’m calling them “trends” but what they really are can be classified as observations based on the content of the Watchlist. I’m not saying they are reflecting the market place. I’m saying they reflect common themes and elements that were noticeable in the Watchlist submissions. Please pay close attention here because some of these aren’t market observations but common errors in the submissions – which means that you will learn what NOT to do next year – if you pay attention. I can tell you that one trend I noticed is that people didn’t pay attention to what I said and the result was repeat mistakes that got them dings – negative scores this year.\nHere we go:\nPlatforms plays increase: There were a significant number of the submissions in multiple areas – customer service, CRM, customer engagement (particularly large number) and others – who claimed to be more platform than solution or application – and could at least marginally and usually robustly, justify the claim.\nReal lack of top of mind re: corporate giving, again: It amazes me how when a company speaks to its culture, corporate giving in whatever format is not even mentioned. Also, the companies that tell me that their corporate giving consists of them allowing their employees to take time off without pay. That’s not even as good as vacation. Step up people. Those of you who make it a prominent part of your culture. Thank you for your wonderful efforts.\nSales acceleration, optimization, enablement up dramatically: The number of submissions who provided some sort of sales adjunct service or application – something that is tied to sales force automation – were way up this year – and what makes this area interesting (I like sales optimization for it) is that they were not competitive – entirely different. The best way to define this is a service or application that supports a margin of advantage in getting a deal closed.\nCustomer engagement and especially customer journeys on a significant upswing: Way up this year, as opposed to last year, when it was marginally up. Customer journey related applications in particular were a big part of the Watchlist submissions.\nLots of transition: markets, management: As last year, once again there have been more major management changes, moves into new markets, and rebranding efforts than ever before, creating a lot of “impact uncertainty” in otherwise very good companies.\nThe outcomes based messaging increased marginally. Last year I said, “There is far too much product-dominant messaging at this stage of the game. Customers are looking for outcomes — how what you provide provides the outcomes that they need to achieve their goals.” I’d love to think I had something to do with the change, but I am not flattering myself in this area – the customers had something to do with it – but the outcomes based focus of the messaging was much better than in the past.\nThe long market nightmare continues: horrible RightX3 overuse – I’m just going to repeat exactly what I said this year with one additional sentence at the end. “This is just me bitching about cliché driven marketing. I don’t know about you but I’m sick of RightX3. It goes something like this: ‘We’re giving customers the right blah for the right ugh in the right yuck.’ This seems to have superseded the need to make sure that the value of your offering is expressed in words that all start with the same letter as the most obnoxious messaging trend. Too many submissions had right, right right. Far too many.” Heres the additional sentence: This year, if you put it in your submission – ding!! Please rethink that. Provide the right message to the right customer without the use of the word right. OMG. I did it now!! Ahhhhh!!\nNow for 2017, the criteria that will be in effect. That will be (minus the changes in the weighting of the questions) almost the same exact criteria as 2016.\nThe 2017 criteria\nThere are two sets of criteria: One embodied in the questionnaire with the 12 questions that have to be answered, and the second with many characteristics I’m looking for that are not publicly apparent. Let’s start with the 12 criteria (not the questions, per se, the criteria).\nHere are the 12 criteria (though not the full set of questions I asked about each):\nCorporate overview: Who are you and why should you be on the Watchlist?\nFinancial overview (confidential): Tell me as much financial information as you are comfortable revealing, but make a case for your financial stability and growth.\nManagement: Who runs the show there when it comes to all customer-facing things, both generally and specifically?\nVision and mission: Not only what is your vision and what is your mission, but also how is it manifested in your business and interactions with the rest of the world?\nTechnology: If you’re a tech company, what are your products, services, and pricing? As a consulting/SI firm, what practices do you have and what is your expertise in those?\nCustomers: Who are your customers, what is your deal size, give me some marquee names if you can?\nPartnerships: How do you think about partnering? Who are your alliance partners and why? What kind of programs do you have?\nMarketing strategy: What is the approach you will take to marketing in the upcoming time frame? What kind of actions does that lead to?\nOutreach (analyst relations; public relations): What is your outreach game plan? Who are you talking to and what kinds of interactions do you have with the analysts and journalists?\nMarket impact: How top of mind are you in the marketplace? What awards have you won? How is your presence sought after and found?\nThought leadership: What kinds of things are you doing to capture mindshare, not market share?\nCulture: How great are you to work for? Work with? (make sure you read what I said earlier about culture and giving).\nThese are merely paraphrased, and by no means complete descriptions of the requirements of submission. Each of these is weighted differentially each year based on real-life market forces. There are also multiple components that drive either positive or negative intangible scores that can have a serious impact on the final result, which aren’t necessarily a direct answer to a specific question. Nor will you ever know more than one or two of them. AND they can change from year to year. I have given you some hints as to a couple in this post, though.\nPlease bear something in mind when it comes to all of this: Just because you didn’t win doesn’t mean you are a bad company. For example, going through a major transition in some way can have a serious effect on your score because of the uncertainty of that transition. Remember this is an impact award, and if I can’t see both the impact you had in the prior year (for example, 2016 award, 2015 impact; the 2017 award, is the impact you had this year) or easily foresee the likely impact you will have in the next three years, your chances of winning are diminished. Transitions make that clear line of sight foggier. There are an enormous number of factors at play in winning the CRM Watchlist.\nAnother thing, just to be entirely candid and perfectly clear, this is geared to established companies, so the larger ones have a better chance (though no guarantee) of winning the award. They have the resources that a lot of smaller companies don’t have to execute on the things they need to do to have an effect on a market. They have a longer-standing history typically, and they have a lot more money. They have a much greater reach and market recognition. They are mature and can invest not only the money, but also the manpower in the specialized activities that can be required to impact a market. In smaller companies, the resources just often aren’t there, but that by no means negates smaller companies from having an impact. There are a few smaller companies that won this year, as in every year that I’ve run this – and it happened again this year.\nAddendum on the 2017 CRM Watchlist registration\nAs of today, the 2017 CRM Watchlist is now open for registration. In order to register, please send me a request for a CRM Watchlist registration form. The email to send me the request is [email protected]\n. No other email or channel. I will send you the form, you then send it back to me at the same address after you fill it out completely. Then when the questionnaire for 2017 is ready, I’ll send you the Watchlist questionnaire with instructions including the 2017 due date.\nIf you are a small company with no revenue or just a beta product with no active customers, really, don’t bother to submit. You won’t win. This is an IMPACT award that means you need to have presence in a market. Several companies this year were missing multiple FUNDAMENTAL components that are needed to have an impact – and of course – had little or nothing to show. This year, one company earned the lowest score in the history of the Watchlist.\nIf you register, please register with the idea that you are going to submit a questionnaire. Don’t register to just get on my radar and then not submit. I am a human being. Thus, I am limited by time in what I do with my life. Consequently, I don’t want to waste time. If you want to get on my radar, there are other ways to do it than register for the Watchlist.\nTo win this, you have to be a formidable presence in the market. You are a company that has a great value, not just to the customers you serve, but also to the market you reside in. You are a company that has a sustainable impact on the actual direction that your market takes, and thus, for a company considering the purchase of products or services, a more than viable candidate for being the top choice in their arsenal (with all the caveats attendant on that statement).\nOkay before the good stuff, my disclaimer – same one as always.\nSome of the winners are my clients; some are not\nSome of the honorable mentions are my clients; some are not\nSome of those that didn’t win are my clients; some are not\nSome of the companies that didn’t enter the Watchlist at all are my clients; some are not.\nReally, finally, the winners\nThe 2016 CRM Watchlist Winners\nLifetime achievement award:\nNONE THIS YEAR – I’m going to open this up to public nomination starting with the 2017 Watchlist. Stay tuned here for that one.\nVendors (in alphabetical order)\n", "deleted" : false }

Introduction\nThis article gives a brief overview of Rover, then focuses on our implementation of the human-robot interface utilizing the Intel® Perceptual Computing SDK for gesture and face detection. For a short introduction to Rover's features, see the Intel® Developer Zone video from Game Developers Conference 2014 in San Francisco:\nIn comparatively contemporary times robots have either been relegated behind closed doors of large industrial manufacturing plants or demonized in movies such as Terminator where they were depicted as destroyers of the human race. Both stereotypes contribute to creating an unfounded fear in self-operating machines losing control and harming the living. But now, vacuum-cleaning and lawn-mowing robots, among others, are beginning a new trend: service robots as dedicated helpers in shared environments with humans. The miniaturization and cost-effective production of range and localization sensors on the one hand and the ever-increasing compute power of modern processors on the other, enable the creation of smart, sensing robots for domestic use cases.\nIn the future, robots will require intelligent interactions with their environment, including adapting to human emotions. State-of-the-art hardware and software, such as the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK paired with the Creative* Interactive Gesture Camera, are paving the way for smarter, connected devices, toys, and domestic helpers.\n2. Cubotix Rover\nWhen Intel announced the Perceptual Computing Challenge in 2013, our team, Devy and Martin Wojtczyk, brainstormed possible use cases utilizing the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK. The combination of a USB-powered camera with an integrated depth sensor and an SDK that enables gesture recognition, face detection, and voice interaction resulted in us building an autonomous, mobile, gesture-controlled and sensing robot called Rover. We were very excited to be selected for an award. Since then, we launched the website with updates on Rover and are in the process of creating an open hardware community.\nThe Cubotix Rover is our attempt to use advanced robotic algorithms to transform off-the-shelf hardware into a smart home robot, capable of learning and understanding unknown environments without prior programming. Instead of unintuitive control panels, the robot is instructed through gestures, natural language, and even facial expressions. Advanced robotic algorithms make Rover location aware and enable it to plan collision-free paths.\n2.1. Gesture Recognition\nFigure 1:Showing a thumbs-up gesture makes Rover happy and mobilizes the robot. Photo courtesy California Academy of Sciences.\nHand gestures are a common form of communication among humans. Think of the police officer in the middle of a loud intersection in Times Square gesturing the stop sign with his open palm facing approaching traffic.Rover is equipped to recognize, respond to, and act on hand gestures captured through the 3D camera. You can mobilize this robot by gesturing thumbs-up, and in response it will also say \"Let's go!\" This robot frowns when you gesture a thumbs-down. Gesturing a high-five renders Rover to crack jokes, such as \"If I had arms, I would totally high-five you\". Gesturing a peace sign renders Rover to say \"Peace\". These hand gestures and the resulting robotic vocal responses are completely customizable and programmable.\nFigure 2: Showing a thumbs-down gesture stops the robot and makes it sad. Photo courtesy California Academy of Sciences.\n2.2. Facial Recognition\nFacial expression is perhaps the most revealing and honest of all the other means of communication. Recognition of these expressions and being able to respond appropriately or inappropriately can mean the difference between forming a bond or a division with another human being. With artificial intelligence the gap separating machines and humans can begin to close if robots are able to empathize. By capturing facial expressions through the camera, Rover can detect smiles or frowns and respond appropriately. Rover knows when a human has come near it through its facial detection algorithms and can greet them by saying \"Hello my name is Rover. What's your name?\", to which most people have responded just as they would with another human being by saying \"Hello I'm ______\". After initiating the conversation, Rover utilizes the Perceptual Computing SDKs face analysis features to distinguish three possible states of the person in front of the camera: happy, sad, or neutral and can respond with an appropriate empathetic expression: \"Why are you sad today?\" or \"Glad to see you happy today!\" Moreover the SDKs face recognition allows Rover to learn and distinguish between individuals for a personalized experience.\n3. Hardware Architecture\nFigure 3:Rover's mobile LEGO* platform. Centrally located with glowing green buttons is the LEGO Mindstorms* EV3 microcontroller, which is connected to the servos that move the base. Also note the support structures and the locking mechanism to mount a laptop.\nRover uses widely accessible and affordable off-the-shelf hardware that many people may already own and can transform into a smart home robot. It consists of a mobile LEGO platform that carries a depth-camera and a laptop for perception, image processing, path-planning, and human-robot interaction. The LEGO Mindstorms* EV3 set is a great tool for rapid prototyping customized robot models. It includes a microcontroller, sensors, and three servos with encoders, which allow for easy calculation of travelled distances.\nFigure 4:Rover's mobile platform with an attached Creative* Interactive Gesture Camera for gesture recognition, face detection, and 3D perception.\nThe Creative Interactive Gesture Camera attached to EV3 contains a QVGA depth sensor and a HD RGB image sensor. The 0.5ft to 3.5ft operating range of the depth sensor allows for 3D perception of objects and obstacles in near range. It is powered solely by the USB port and doesn't require an additional power supply, which makes it a good fit for mobile use on a robot. Rover's laptop-an Ultrabook™ with an Intel® Core i7 processor and a touch screen-is mounted on top of the mobile LEGO platform and interfaces the camera and the LEGO microcontroller. The laptop is powerful enough to perform face detection and gesture and speech recognition and to evaluate the depth images in soft real time to steer the robot and avoid obstacles. All depth images and encoder data from the servos are filtered and combined into a map, which serves the robot for indoor localization and collision-free path planning.\nFigure 5:Complete Rover assembly with the mobile LEGO* platform base, the Creative* Interactive Gesture Camera in the front and the laptop attached and locked in place.\n4. Software Architecture\nFigure 6:Rover's software architecture with most components for perception, a couple of planners, and a few application use cases. All of these building blocks run simultaneously in multiple threads and communicate with each other via messages. The green-tinted components utilize the Intel® Perceptual Computing SDK. All other modules are custom-built.\nRover's control software is a multi-threaded application integrating a graphical user interface implemented in the cross-platform application framework Qt, a perception layer utilizing the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK, and custom-built planning, sensing, and hardware interface components. CMake*, a popular open-source build system, is used to find all necessary dependencies, configure the project, and create a Visual Studio* solution on Windows*. The application runs on an Ultrabook laptop running the Windows operating system and mounted directly on the mobile LEGO platform.\nAs shown in Figure 7, the application layer has three different use case components: the visible and audible Human-Robot Interface, an Exploration use case that lets Rover explore a new and unknown environment, and a smartphone remote control of the robot. The planning layer includes a collision-free path planner based on a learned map and a task planner that decides for the robot to move, explore, and interact with the user. A larger number of components form the perception layer, which is common for service robots as they have to sense their often unknown environments and respond safely to unexpected changes. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Obstacle Detection are custom-built and based on the depth images from the Perceptual Computing SDK, which also provides the functionality for gesture recognition, face detection, and speech recognition.\nThe following sections briefly cover the Human-Robot Interface and describe in more detail the implementation of gesture recognition and face detection for the robot.\n4.1. User Interface\nThe human-robot interface of Rover is implemented as a Qt5 application ]. Qt includes tools for window and widget creation and commonly used features, such as threads and futures for concurrent computations. The main window depicts a stylized face consisting of two buttons: for the robot's eyes and mouth. Depending on the robot's mood the mouth forms a smile or a frown. When nobody interacts with the robot, it goes to sleep. When it detects a person in front of it, it wakes up and responds to gestures, which trigger actions. The robot's main program launches several different threads for the detection of different Intel Perceptual Computing features. It utilizes Qt's central signal/slot mechanism for communication between objects and threads. Qt's implementation of future classes is utilized whenever the robot speaks for asynchronous speech output.\n4.2. Perception\nThe robot's perception relies on the camera featuring a color and a depth sensor. The camera is interfaced through the SDK, which enables applications to easily integrate gesture, face, and speech recognition, as well speech synthesis.\n4.2.1. Gesture Recognition\nSimple, easy-to-learn hand gestures, which are realized utilizing the SDK, trigger most of Rover's actions. When a person shows a thumbs-up gesture, the robot will look happy, say \"Let's go!\" and can start autonomous driving or another configured action. When the robot is shown a thumbs-down gesture, it will put on a sad face, vocalize its unhappiness, and stop mobile activities in its default configuration. When showing the robot a high-five, it will crack a joke. Rover responds to all of the SDK's default gestures, but here we will just focus on these three: thumbs-up, thumbs-down, and high-five.\nRover's gesture recognition is implemented in a class GesturePipeline, which runs in a separate thread and is based on the class UtilPipeline out of the convenience library pxcutils in the SDK and QObject from the Qt framework. GesturePipeline implements the two virtual UtilPipeline functions OnGesture() and OnNewFrame() and emits a signal for each recognized gesture. The class also implements the two slots work() and cleanup(), which are required to move the pipeline into its own QThread. Therefore, the declaration of GesturePipeline is very simple and similar to the provided gesture sample:\n01\n", "deleted" : false }

Among other things, wireless specialist Aruba added Ethernet switches to its architecture and Meraki took administration of both network components into the cloud. Rivals Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Cisco Systems snapped up both of those companies.\nNow Dell has gotten into the game, not by acquisition but through a partnership with WLAN vendor Aerohive Networks. On Tuesday, the two companies are introducing a unified management tool called HiveManager NG.\nThe system extends Aerohive’s own management software to oversee Dell’s N Series wired edge switches. With one dashboard for monitoring and configuring both, it basically turns all edge infrastructure into a single network. This simplifies management so much that it can save enterprises time and money, the vendors said.\nThe latest generation of Wi-Fi surpasses desktop Ethernet’s typical speed of 1Gbps (bit per second), making it a central part of enterprise LANs and increasingly the main way users connect.\n“There comes a point when the desktop or mobile user will not need to plug in,” Dell’Oro Group analyst Chris DePuy said.\nThe new version of Wi-Fi, called 802.11ac Wave 2, is also good business for wired network vendors. The faster speed is forcing enterprises to upgrade both their access points and the switches that feed them, using a new form of Ethernet designed just for this purpose. That's bringing wired and wireless companies together, and the Aerohive partnership is a way for Dell to play that game, DePuy said.\nHiveManager NG is a strictly software platform that runs in public or private clouds, so the data and controls can be reached from anywhere. Dell and Aerohive expect some large enterprises to buy the software for in-house deployment, while smaller customers will turn to public clouds. Service and support from Dell, which also will span wired and wireless, can be included in the package.\nUnified management can save enterprises money and time by making it easier to solve network users’ problems on the first call, said David Greene, Aerohive’s senior vice president and chief marketing officer. The HiveManager NG dashboard will let front-line tech support resolve issues more often without having to pass them on to specialists.\nAmong other things, the system performs continuous monitoring of basic conditions like who was on the network when and whether connections were working. If a user reports a problem, that makes it easy to go back and review what was happening. When the system detects a problem, it automatically starts collecting more detailed information for diagnosis, Greene said.\nDell has similar tools for managing all its wireline switches, from the data center out to the edge, but HiveManager streamlines management by adding in wireless.

Among other things, wireless specialist Aruba added Ethernet switches to its architecture and Meraki took administration of both network components into the cloud. Rivals Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Cisco Systems snapped up both of those companies.\nNow Dell has gotten into the game, not by acquisition but through a partnership with WLAN vendor Aerohive Networks. On Tuesday, the two companies are introducing a unified management tool called HiveManager NG.\nThe system extends Aerohive’s own management software to oversee Dell’s N Series wired edge switches. With one dashboard for monitoring and configuring both, it basically turns all edge infrastructure into a single network. This simplifies management so much that it can save enterprises time and money, the vendors said.\nThe latest generation of Wi-Fi surpasses desktop Ethernet’s typical speed of 1Gbps (bit per second), making it a central part of enterprise LANs and increasingly the main way users connect.\n“There comes a point when the desktop or mobile user will not need to plug in,” Dell’Oro Group analyst Chris DePuy said.\nThe new version of Wi-Fi, called 802.11ac Wave 2, is also good business for wired network vendors. The faster speed is forcing enterprises to upgrade both their access points and the switches that feed them, using a new form of Ethernet designed just for this purpose. That's bringing wired and wireless companies together, and the Aerohive partnership is a way for Dell to play that game, DePuy said.\nHiveManager NG is a strictly software platform that runs in public or private clouds, so the data and controls can be reached from anywhere. Dell and Aerohive expect some large enterprises to buy the software for in-house deployment, while smaller customers will turn to public clouds. Service and support from Dell, which also will span wired and wireless, can be included in the package.\nUnified management can save enterprises money and time by making it easier to solve network users’ problems on the first call, said David Greene, Aerohive’s senior vice president and chief marketing officer. The HiveManager NG dashboard will let front-line tech support resolve issues more often without having to pass them on to specialists.\nAmong other things, the system performs continuous monitoring of basic conditions like who was on the network when and whether connections were working. If a user reports a problem, that makes it easy to go back and review what was happening. When the system detects a problem, it automatically starts collecting more detailed information for diagnosis, Greene said.\nDell has similar tools for managing all its wireline switches, from the data center out to the edge, but HiveManager streamlines management by adding in wireless. The companies plan to extend the software to Dell’s higher-end C series and lower-end X series switches over the course of this year and into next year.\nRelated:\n", "deleted" : false }

Moving to a new domain may buy the ICE targeted sites some time , but as TVShack.cc seizure proves, it’s not clear what exactly is safe.\nThere seems to be some confusion surrounding whether a TLD registrar like Verisign or Afilias or ICANN is the ultimate decider in whether to comply with an ICE takedown request.

But it turns out that economic downturns are good times to start businesses. First, the filter on ideas is much finer, so if you get going, it probably means that it is a really good opportunity. Second, the company will have a laser focus on building real ROI value. Third, while other young companies that came before may be experiencing declining markets, your company is in the development stage. Fourth, it is a great time to hire great talent since there are fewer good jobs. And finally, there are fewer cars on the road and the commute is better!\nHistory is strewn with examples of now-famous companies, tech and otherwise, that began or flourished during recessions and bear markets, from Microsoft to FedEx to CNN. A few lesser-known but powerful examples:\nIn 2000, before the  dot.com  bubble burst, Veritas Software was a $1.2 billion-a-year-company. At the end of 2001, Veritas (later acquired by Symantec) had boosted annual revenue by $300 million and gained market share. Conversely, Siebel Systems dropped from $2 billion-a-year-revenue to $800 million. Veritas was running storage management in the data center, which was mission critical. Siebel was adding a new application that was “postponable.”\nIn March 2001, the depths of the dot-com crash, VMWare released ESX. IT departments were focusing on projects that improved the bottom line, and ESX provided an easy-to-quantify proposition – server consolidation. “Install inexpensive VMware, buy fewer expensive servers, and use less power and space and management overhead.\nAmid the tech slide that accompanied the Great Recession in 2010, storage management company Isilon Systems had four straight quarters of profitability before being acquired by EMC for $2.25 billion. Why was Isilon able to grow during this awful time? It was an ROI darling with its scale-out architecture that let companies intelligently grow storage while eliminating costly over-provisioning.\nStarting or growing a business during a downturn can be challenging. Fewer companies go public, those that already have gone public often find their stock punished, and VC funding and valuations take a hit. Giving customers what they need becomes irreplaceable when times get tough. Those that achieve this objective will find a way to thrive while others fall by the wayside.\nFor example, companies in the software-defined storage and networking spaces will probably do well as the economy comes under pressure. They save money by enabling customers to maximize the performance of high-end systems using cost-effective commodity hardware. I’ve invested in companies like  PernixData  and  Zerto  because I think they’re the latest examples of companies with strong ROI stories, much in the same way VMware built a strong business virtualizing servers in the 2000s.\nSimilarly, companies that transition traditional infrastructure into cloud-based services have a distinct advantage in a downturn, as they increase flexibility while reducing costs substantially through innovative provisioning and pricing models. This is what attracted me to a company like  SugarCRM .\nWho will lose? Any spend seen as non-essential will be questioned. The old guard companies like IBM and Oracle have an even tougher row to hoe as customers comb through their enterprises hunting for opportunities to replace expensive, specialized solutions with lower-cost open-source and commodity-hardware-based ones that provide equal performance.\nThese dynamics should ring familiar from previous tech sector tumbles. Remember Sequoia Capital’s “Doomsday” presentation in 2008? It warned startups to manage spending and growth assumptions, realize that IT spending is being heavily scrutinized, and establish a clear revenue model.\nHow quickly we forget. Valuations have returned to new and unsustainable levels in the last few years. I frequently advise younger entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley that the joyride inevitably will end and to prepare their companies for the headwinds, but sadly they never believe me. Good times are all they have known.\nThe number of tech IPOs plunged to a six-year low in 2015 – just 23 companies raised a total of $4.2 billion in 2015, down from 55 and $32.3 billion a year earlier, according to Renaissance Capital – and now we’re off to the worst start of a year for tech stocks since the Great Recession. Even profitable companies like LinkedIn have seen their stocks collapse.\nIt is important to note that IPO access and their valuations are not isolated phenomena. Capital markets are laddered, and what happens in one part has a direct and immediate effect on those above and below.\nHow bad will things get? I think not as bad as 2001 or 2008. And this downturn will likely be buffered by the fact there’s still a lot of money sitting on the sidelines in VCs and there are still decent amounts of cash on the balance sheets of many young startups.\nBut it’s only a matter of time before we see some young firms fail because of lack of capital. It happens every time the bubble bursts, and this time will be no different.\nBut many companies will survive and prosper. The ones that solve real customer problems today and can easily quantify a return on investment for tomorrow will survive, and they’ll be the stronger for it.\nMark Leslie is managing partner of Leslie Ventures, a private investment company.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPress Releases\n", "deleted" : false }

The agency has sent the regulations to the Office of Management and Budget, which will determine whether they comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act. If that goes according to plan, they'll get published on the Federal Register, making them official.\nAt the same time, the Commission is looking for candidates for its Open Internet Advisory Committee, tasked with \"tracking developments with respect to the freedom and openness of the Internet.\"\nWe're talking October—at the earliest—before these rules are finally enforceable. And once that happens, it's likely that Verizon and/or MetroPCS will once again ask a federal court to strike them down (three months ago a judge ruled the companies couldn't sue until the provisions were formally released). \nMeanwhile, at least a few people will doubtless cite the neutrality provisions to complain about ISP behavior. And we're betting that controversial restrictions on third-party tethering applications will come under some kind of scrutiny.\nIndeed, they already have. As we've reported , Free Press wants the FCC to take a close look at Google's move to curtail access (or, as Google puts it, making them \"unavailable for download\" via the Android Market) to independent 4G tethering apps. Those indie tethering downloads are a sweet deal; for the initial price of the software, they allow you to connect your mobile to your laptop and access the Internet. Similar apps from your ISP can cost as much as $30 a month.\nPlease see Google\nGoogle and the ISPs have formed a circular finger-pointing squad concerning this issue. The search engine giant says it is curtailing the technology in response to requests from wireless carriers. But when we asked Google's Droid partner Verizon for its version of the story, we got a \"see Google\" response. \"It's important to remember, Google manages what's available in the Android Market,\" a Verizon spokesperson told us.\nRegardless of where it started, Free Press says that this sort of behavior represents a violation of the C Block open device access rules that Verizon agreed to when it bought a huge chunk of 700MHz spectrum on the license area in question. \"Removing the applications from the Android Market curtails, restrains, and interferes with the ability of subscribers to use the applications of their choice by making it more difficult to download and install those applications,\" the reform group warns.\nVan Schewick\nNow a prominent professor of Internet architecture has written to the Commission , hastening to agree.\n\"Verizon Wireless's practice and Free Press's complaint raise fundamental issues of Internet openness policy,\" argues Barbara van Schewick , Associate Professor of Law and Engineering at Stanford University. \"Free Press's complaint implicates not only the specific question of whether Verizon Wireless has violated the conditions associated with its spectrum licenses, but also the more general question of how to apply openness rules to mobile networks.\"\nVan Schewick is the author of Internet Architecture and Innovation (MIT Press), and one of a group of scholars who complained to the FCC about Comcast's behavior in the 2008 BitTorrent case. Internet Architecture contends that the 'Net's design structure is changing in ways \"that deviate from the Internet's original design principles,\" removing features that encouraged innovation during the founding days of cyberspace. The alterations \"reduce the amount and quality of application innovation and limit users' ability to use the Internet as they see fit.\"\nAs in, for example, keeping inexpensive third-party tethering apps off the Google Android Market.\nApplication-agnostic discrimination\nThe complexity, of course, with defining the tethering app restriction problem as related to \"fundamental issues of Internet openness policy\" is that the FCC's open Internet rules exclude mobile wireless from its non-discrimination provisions (that's probably why the focus has been mostly on the C Block auction rules).\nBut Van Schewick's longer commentary to the Commission filed last year is worth a read, because at some point the FCC may have to deal with this tethering issue. Back in December, Van Schewick urged the FCC to adopt a non-discrimination rule that \"clearly bans application-specific discrimination (i.e. discrimination based on application or class of application)\" but would allow \"application-agnostic discrimination.\"\nVan Schewick explained the distinction as so:\nThus, a network provider would not be allowed to treat Vonage differently from Skype, or Comcast's Fancast differently from Hulu. That would be discrimination based on application. Nor would it be allowed to treat online video differently from e-mail. That would be discrimination based on class of application.\nBut:\nIt would be allowed to treat data packets differently based on criteria that have nothing to do with the application or class of application. For example, during times of congestion, a network provider could give one person a larger share of the available bandwidth than another, for example because this person pays more for Internet access or has used the Internet less over a certain period of time. But it could not throttle the bandwidth available to a specific online video application such as Hulu in particular, or online video in general. That would be application-specific discrimination.\nThe point of the rule would be to stop network providers from \"distorting the playing field\" between specific applications or classes of apps. At the same time, it would allow ISPs to use various network management tools to address congestion and other issues.\n\"Network providers would be able to enforce fairness among users, allocating bandwidth among users in application-agnostic ways, but how a user decides to use its 'share' of bandwidth, both in general and at a particular point in time would be decided by the user,\" van Schewick suggests.\nDiscrimination or blocking?\nThe FCC could conceivably deploy this concept on behalf of wired Internet users once it releases its net neutrality rules. But when it comes to third-party tethering apps, the question is whether such rules could be extended to wireless. The agency's  order  (PDF) makes the distinction between wired and wireless regulation clear (we've added the italics):\n\"Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.\"\n\"No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services.\"\nClearly the non-discrimination concept as outlined here wouldn't apply to downloadable third-party mobile tethering software. The next question is whether denying these apps a place on the Android Market could be construed as \"blocking.\" They are, after all, in competition with ISP-offered pay-to-tether services; but is keeping them off the Market a \"block\"?\nIt's yet another conundrum for the FCC to tackle, if it wants—though a good chunk of its attention will likely be spent first defending the legal basis of its net neutrality rules in court.\n", "deleted" : false }

They flipped the entire category on its ear. The success of their recent IPO is a signal that their market segment could finally be coming into its own and that the capital markets are starting to realize there is real value in similar companies. And that's not only a good sign for their sector, but also for job seekers.\nMcGovern, former CEO of CareerBuilder and current CEO of Jobfox , agrees. \"With online job boards, it's possible for hiring companies to receive an average of 200-300 resumes per opening. Job seekers need something better than a 1 in 300 chance.\" Built from the ground up to serve as a tool for recruitment and finding a job, McGovern hopes Jobfox will be a category killer.\n\"What makes us unique is the ability to grow your professional network without having to worry about your boss thinking you're looking for a job—unlike other sites, our networking platform of 7 million users is completely private.\" And they might be onto something—as of December 2010, Jobfox reports their users are 72% more likely to find a job than those who rely on job boards alone.\nAlthough companies are now able to precisely match people with jobs and potential networking contacts thanks to the help of complex proprietary algorithms , many are still struggling to figure exactly out what to do with career changers as they don't always fit neatly into specific job categories or career buckets—something LinkedIn's platform is equipped to do better than anyone else currently on the market.\nIf there's one key takeaway from LinkedIn's meteoric rise, it's the continued importance of social capital and forging meaningful connections with others. After all, relationships aren't built on algorithms alone. At least not yet.\n", "deleted" : false }

That is OK.\nI would point out that for other people the larger size will be necessary. I have no idea what the breakdown will be. Photographers, graphic designers, engineers and maybe realtors to name a few may benefit from the larger display to view and show off their work.\nPersonally, I like the larger size for work because I view a lot of scientific data in the form of images and I need to see (or show to others) multiple images at once. I use it on the sofa or in bed to read with and don’t find that to be difficult.\nAlso, as a change of how I work I am considering giving up my MacBook Pro 15 and getting an iMac 27 and then using some form of VNC to remotely connect with the iMac through the iPad Pro 12.9 while on the road. I have been testing this with Splashtop and it works fairly well. I wouldn’t demo my company’s product this way or try to do a lot of work this way but in a pinch I can fairly easily calculate a result and send it to myself via iCloud or Dropbox. Presumably this will only get better as time goes on. The larger screen of the 12.9 iPP helps because of the mismatch with the screen of the home computer. When I tried this with my smaller iPad it required so much panning and zooming I quickly got tired.\nIt is interesting to think that in five years or so we would rely solely on our phones as our computing devices.

(\"GCI\") (NASDAQ: GNCMA ) today reported its third quarter 2015 results.\nGrowth in broadband data subscribers and ARPU coupled with strong wireless roaming drove consolidated revenues for the third quarter of 2015 to $259 million, an increase of $18 million or seven percent when compared with the third quarter of 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $97 million, growing $3 million or four percent compared with the third quarter of 2014. EBITDA for the quarter was negatively affected by $4 million in AWN-related transition costs and the absence of political advertising, which was particularly strong in the third quarter of 2014. On a comparative basis, quarterly EBITDA benefited from $8 million in equipment installment plan revenue versus $7 million in the second quarter of 2015 and none in 2014.  As more customers take our equipment installment plans, we are seeing a reduction in ARPU which dampens the EBITDA benefit of equipment installment revenue.\n\"We are pleased with our strong quarter led by roaming and backhaul revenues of $45 million\", said Ron Duncan, GCI's president and Chief Executive Officer.  \"We anticipate that this quarter will represent the high water mark of those revenues for the foreseeable future.  We have been working with our largest carrier customers to offer them a competitive alternative that will reduce their rates, eliminate the seasonality in our revenues, and retain significant traffic on our network.

In 2013, Livemocha had 16 million active users and 35 employees.\nMichael Schutzler\nAt first, Livemocha began by offering free language instruction. Then, the company offered some premium courses that cost money — and people were willing to pay. In 2010, it was honored by Time Magazine as one of the top 50 websites.\nAs Livemocha grew and continued its online success, Schultzler continued to keep an eye on Rosetta Stone. When the other language company made its first forays into the online world, he called them an “embarrassment.”\nThen, something changed. Schultzer said it was that Rosetta Stone got a new CEO, Steve Swad, whose leadership he admired. In 2013, Rosetta Stone bought the Seattle company for $8.5 million. Livemocha had raised more than $19 million in venture capital from Maveron, August Capital and others.\nSchutzler briefly stayed with Rosetta Stone as a “ senior advisor to the CEO ,” but left after 4 months to become the CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association.\nSince then, the two companies have combined, with Rosetta Stone taking over Livemocha’s online infrastructure.\nHere’s the full text of the e-mail this week:\nAs a Livemocha member and a language enthusiast, you’ve helped build a very special community. Over the past number of years, Livemocha has sparked countless conversations and connections among millions of language lovers around the world.\nUnfortunately, the Livemocha community will close permanently on Friday, April 22, 2016, and you will no longer be able to access your account after that date.\nWe highly encourage you to remain engaged, make friends, use those remaining beans, and build life long memories with us for the next few weeks.\nBecause we appreciate you and remain committed to your language learning success we invite you to download our award winning mobile application; Learn Languages with Rosetta Stone from any of these leading application stores for free and try any of the 24 languages it offers:\nApple App Store , Google Play Store , Amazon App Store\nDon’t worry if you are still on a traditional computer – try this.\nWe have some very exciting things planned for our language learning suite and we hope you will choose to stay with us through this journey.\nThe Rosetta Stone / Livemocha Team\nJournalist and writer Madeline Vuong is a graduate of Williams College. Follow her on Twitter @madelinewriter .\nAttend the GeekWire Sports Tech Summit\nLA Clippers owner Steve Ballmer. Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber. Brooks Running CEO Jim Weber. And Super Bowl champion Doug Baldwin Jr. of the Seattle Seahawks. Those are just a few of the speakers who will join us at the first-ever GeekWire Sports Tech Summit.

When we make decisions fast, we rely on habit and intuition, forms of thinking that are difficult to change or manipulate, Kahneman argues.\nBut the good news is that while formal education and training may not change how people think intuitively, technology can help lessen the negative impact of common decision-making mistakes on personal finance outcomes. Here’s a non-comprehensive look at how technology is now tackling three behavioral finance biases that can contribute to poor decisions.\nFinancial Bias 1: Salience\nSalience  refers to how noticeable an event or information is. According to behavioral finance research, people tend to act on easily recalled and colorful information and ignore data that are less readily available for mental processing (think “out of sight, out of mind”).\nA number of budgeting apps aim to help users address this bias by collating debt, bills and spending information in an easily accessible interface. The idea is that having all of this information readily available can make it easier for people to be proactive about their finances.\nFor example,  Mint Bills  aims to help users stay on top of their bills by sending reminders when bills are due, letting users pay bills immediately or via scheduled future payments. Meanwhile,  Level Money  tells users how much they can spend on a given day, once they have connected their bank accounts and entered their income, bills and desired savings.\nFinancial Bias 2: Present Bias and Procrastination\nThe  present bias  refers to the tendency to overweight rewards today and underweight pain and losses in the future, leading people to make choices about the future that their future selves would probably prefer not to be making. In other words, the present bias often leads people to push strenuous or boring activities into the future, i.e. to procrastinate. It applies to many areas of life, from eating and living healthily (think buying a gym membership but hardly using it) to saving and investing. For instance, many people realize that they should save for retirement, but they prefer to start saving tomorrow or next month.\nMany goal setting apps aim to address this bias by helping users stay on track with their goals via frequent reminders, penalties, peer pressure and game-like features.\nFor example,  stickK , developed by Yale behavioral economists, penalizes users for not reaching goals by donating their money, depending on the chosen settings, to a charity, to friends or to an organization the user opposes. Users can also make their goals public and invite friends to serve as supporters for encouragement, peer pressure and added accountability. Elsewhere,  Coach.me , another goal setting and tracking app that uses social community for motivation, offers paid personal coaches across a range of personal finance goals.\nFinancial Bias 3: Loss Aversion\nLoss aversion  refers to people’s tendency to feel the pain from losses much more acutely than the joy from similar-sized gains. Loss aversion is often cited as one of the main reasons people have trouble saving for the future.\nSome savings apps aim to encourage saving through having users set up explicit goals or automatic savings triggers. Others boost savings behind the scenes by rounding up purchases or by quietly siphoning money into a savings account when past spending patterns indicate that it’s not needed. The technology helps address both procrastination related to saving, and to the extent saving takes place automatically behind the scenes, loss aversion.\nFor example,  Acorns  rounds up users’ everyday transactions and invests the change into a diversified portfolio. Elsewhere,  Qapital  allows users to save with rules or triggers, eliminating willpower. Users can charge themselves for guilty pleasures with a “fine”; challenge themselves to underspend their budget and save the differential; round up purchases and save the change; or autosave a set amount daily, weekly or monthly. Alternatively, users can have savings triggered by anything from rainy weather to meeting their exercise goals, and they can post savings goals on social media for peer support.\nTo be sure, some of these app features have been around a long time in other forms; many employers, for instance, have long offered employees the option of automatic withdrawals from paychecks directly into 401(k) accounts. Also, at least for now, some of these technologies may be most helpful for achieving smaller, near-term savings goals.\nIn addition, these kinds of offerings and services often don’t come for free, and if they are advertised as free, users should make sure they’re aware of how the firm plans to use their personal data. Finally, while financial advisors can generally still offer more holistic and customized advice, these apps can help you stay on track day-to-day and avoid succumbing to behavioral biases.\nfintech investing behaviors investing education personal investing\nShare\nThe opinions expressed in this reprint are intended to provide insight or education and are not intended as individual investment advice.

In a new blog post founder Mary Lou Jepsen teases that Pixel Qi has \"new architecture\" that has the same 2048 x 1536 resolution as the new iPad's Retina display and yet uses much less power. According to the chart below, it looks like the power savings are still just \"proposed\" at this point, but it's still good to hear the company's at least trying to make a screen that uses far less less power than the iPad's. All those power savings might lead you to believe that the screen would look nothing like the iPad's, but Jespen says that its contrast, color saturation, and viewing angle are all better than the Retina display. We'll have to see it to believe it, but that might not be as far off as you think: the company is apparently already in the process of finalizing development partners for the new display.\n", "deleted" : false }

The company claims that small sites average one to five feedback messages per day, medium sites average 20-30, and large sites average 50-1,000. Kampyle presents the most value to these large sites, which must manage their feedback effectively or drown in a sea of suggestions.\nKampyle naturally got the idea to integrate into website analytics from user feedback. The startup found that users would often keep two browser tabs open at once: one for Google Analytics and one for its own dashboard. Tracking analytics and feedback side-by-side allows website owners to keep a closer eye on usage patterns and quickly identify technical and usability issues. The integration is also meant to help with A/B testing and the measurement of other changes to a site, such as the addition of new pages or sections and how they affect user behavior.\nKampyle has been integrated into Google Analytics by way of a greasemonkey script. Publishers must install a Firefox Add-on to enable the functionality (no other browser is supported at this time). The integration with Nuconomy, a next generation web analytics platform , is far “cleaner” since both companies are in Yossi Vardi’s portfolio. The two companies worked out a private API that enables users to view feedback messages related to particular pages and then hop over to analyze engagement and interaction analytics for the same pages in Nuconomy.\nBeyond these integrations, Kampyle has also added 60 language translations to its feedback form. Forms created in English can now be instantly deployed in French, German, or any of the other available languages. A greater degree of customization is also now available with categories, sub-categories, colors, icons and feedback button styles.\n", "deleted" : false }

Today, Hitachi is introducing its first consumer products since the pickup, and while you'll notice a hint of 'Simple' in the titles, the branding is all Hitachi. First up is the water-resistant and shock-proof SimpleTOUGH portable USB drive (250/320/500GB for $99.99/$119.99/$149.99), which can survive a 3-meter fall and boasts a twistable USB cable that's permanently affixed to the enclosure.\nNext, there's the SimpleDRIVE Mini, which is a stylish, colorful portable HDD that is now shipping in red wine (250GB; $89.99), blue dusk (320GB; $109.99) and carbon fiber black (500GB; $139.99). Finally, there's Hitachi's alternative to the Pogoplug : the SimpleNET USB/NAS adapter. Put simply, this $79 device enables up to two USB HDDs to be placed on a network, though Hitachi makes clear that this is a convenience device, not a performance device. The 10/100 Ethernet jack is evidence of that, but hey, if you need a quick-and-dirty way to get your hard drive (regardless of format, by the way) on the web, this will certainly do it. Full release is after the break.\nHITACHI GST UNVEILS THREE CONSUMER STORAGE SOLUTIONS\nTwo Portable Drives and a Network Storage Adapter from Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Gives Users Simple Ways to Share, Protect and Access Their Digital Content\nSan Jose, Calif., July 13, 2009 – As one of the world's most recognized and trusted brands, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (Hitachi GST) today unveiled three new consumer products following the acquisition of SimpleTech by Fabrik earlier this year. The new Hitachi branded products include the SimpleTOUGH™ portable USB drive, industry's only water-resistant1 and shock-resistant2 external hard drive from a global hard drive manufacturer; the stylish and colorful SimpleDRIVE Mini™ portable USB drive; and the SimpleNET™ network storage adapter for easily sharing existing USB drive content over a home or office network. All SimpleTech external storage solutions now leverage Hitachi's award-winning, reliable hard drives and strong global brand creating additional advantages for road warriors, prosumers, small office/home office (SOHO) users, or virtually anyone looking for a simple and reliable way to store, protect, and better manage their data.\n\"Today's announcement further extends the Hitachi GST brand into the consumer market with the reliability, confidence and dependability you would expect from one of the world's leading hard drive suppliers,\" said Mike Williams, General Manager of Hitachi GST Branded Business. \"Re-branding SimpleTech to the Hitachi brand is an important step in differentiating our solutions in the marketplace. We believe that given the global strength of Hitachi, the close relationships we have built with our end-users as SimpleTech, and the continued support of our retail and channel partners, we are well positioned to move our Branded Business and the industry forward.\"\nHitachi SimpleTOUGH Portable USB 2.0 Drive\nIf you work hard or play hard, the Hitachi SimpleTOUGH is one of the world's most rugged drives for protecting data in harsh environments. Designed for serious mobility, it is the only water- and shock-resistant external drive available today from a global hard drive manufacturer. Engineered to sustain a three meter drop (9.8 feet) and able to withstand the pressure of a one-ton class commercial truck3, the SimpleTOUGH drive can take on more falls, knocks and spills than any average external drive on the market. Besides that, it's ready for the great outdoors. The Hitachi SimpleTOUGH drive includes a \"never-lose\" foldaway USB cable, ergonomic sides for easy carrying, and a cool topside LED for power status. But don't be fooled by its handsome exterior. Not only is SimpleTOUGH rugged on the outside, it's dependable and reliable on the inside. All SimpleTOUGH portable drives integrate Hitachi's award-winning Travelstar hard drives, which can be found in virtually all top brand notebooks around the world. Known for its proven, dependable design, Hitachi Travelstar drives provide best-of-breed operating shock at 400G operating and 1,000G non operating shock, and feature the company's TrueTrack Technology™, providing added data protection against rough handling. Packaged in one streamlined solution, the SimpleTOUGH portable drive by Hitachi is USB powered for on-the-go convenience. The manufacturer's suggested retail pricing (MSRP) is $99.99 for 250GB, $119.99 for 320GB, and $149.99 for 500GB.\nHitachi SimpleDRIVE Mini Portable USB 2.0 Drive\nYour belongings say a lot about your personality, so why should your hard drive look like a toaster? Show off your style with the Hitachi SimpleDRIVE Mini portable drive. Designed for an increasingly mobile world, the Hitachi SimpleDRIVE Mini portable drive is stylish storage made simple. It continues SimpleTech's legacy of offering a unique contemporary design with multiple colors, while delivering streamlined, yet simple ways to store and protect your data. The SimpleDRIVE Mini uses dependable hard drives from Hitachi so you can rest assured that your data is stored on a leading hard drive. Depending on your mood, personal style or capacity needs, you have color choices of red wine in 250GB, blue dusk in 320GB or carbon fiber for a textured black look at 500GB. MSRP is $89.99 for 250GB, $109.99 for 320GB and $139.99 for 500GB. All SimpleDRIVE Minis are USB powered.\nHitachi SimpleNET USB Drive Network Adapter\nNot only is Hitachi GST delivering simple ways to store and protect your content, it is extending the value of your new or existing USB drive with SimpleNET. The Hitachi SimpleNET is a small network adapter that allows you to share and access existing USB hard drive content over a home or small business network. Simply plug a USB hard drive into SimpleNET and then plug SimpleNET into an Ethernet network. It's that easy. The USB drive appears as a drive on the network so you can easily share your pics, flix, tunes and docs with everyone on your network. With no proprietary formats or reformatting of the drive required, you can easily hot swap your USB drive between your computer and the Hitachi SimpleNET device at any time. The SimpleNET solution is easy-to-install and easy-to-use for Mac, PC and Linux users, and you can even connect up to two USB drives at once. MSRP for the SimpleNET adapter is $79 MSRP.\nAny data worth saving is worth protecting\nThanks to the increasingly digital lives we lead, our digital content – our family photos, music libraries, home videos and important business and financial information – is quickly becoming the most valued asset in our possession. More often than not, data is coming in so fast and from so many places, that people forget to back it up. If an accident does occur to the drive, it could cost thousands of dollars to recover the data. That's where simple set-it-and-forget-it solutions from Hitachi GST can help.\nIn October 2007, SimpleTech was the first external storage brand to offer both local and online backup. Hitachi GST is continuing this tradition with SimpleTOUGH and SimpleDRIVE Mini. Both drives offer two levels of data protection, local backup and online backup, giving customers peace of mind that their data is safe in the event of fire, theft or natural disaster. Each new portable drive includes 2GB of free online backup space that can be used to safely store irreplaceable files offsite and online. Or, for less than five dollars a month, users can upgrade to unlimited online capacity. For more information, please visit http://www.HitachiUltimateBackup.com.\nUnlike any other external storage solution on the market, the Hitachi SimpleTOUGH and SimpleDRIVE Mini drives also come bundled with Joggle.com. Joggle is an online digital content manager that helps you keep track of pics, flix, tunes and docs from one centralized location. Through its sleek, streamlined user interface, you can see all your stuff on a single screen, and can easily share slideshows and play lists with friends and family via email, blogs, social networking sites and more.\nDuring the early stages of the brand transition, Hitachi SimpleTOUGH, SimpleDRIVE Mini and SimpleNET product information and support is provided by SimpleTech.

In other words, it's testing the waters to see who in the public sphere will find and use it.\nAnd I'm just not sure who that is.\nSimilar to Paggi.com , Zude allows you to create your own, personalized Web pages or profile page--called a \"Zudescape\"--with text, photos, videos, audio files, widgets, gadgets, Web sites and feeds. As of now, the company is offering registered users an unlimited amount of pages.\nViewing access to your pages can be granted to the general public, limited to you only, or limited to Zude users designated by you.\nThe nice thing about Zude is that it offers the type of freedom many people probably wish their MySpace or Facbook pages allowed.\nBut the site is a little busy at first glance and may intimidate the average user.\nIt also took some time to figure out exactly how its page-building tools work. Zude currently works with Firefox and Internet Explorer, with support for the Safari and Opera Web browsers in the works. However, you must modify your browser to allow pop-ups from the Zude.com site and download the Zude extensions in order for the tool to work. No, really. The drag-and-drop feature that allows you to add objects to your pages will not work at all unless you make a pop-up exception for the site and download the software.\nEven then, the site does take some getting used to, and adding content beyond the immediate offerings is very tricky.\nThis is one of those sites we'll probably check back with in a few months to see where it's gone after some deep, public user-testing and, based on user recommendations, some tinkering with the interface.\nZude user 'Jay' pays tribute to dead musicians on his 'Heaven's Biggest Gig' Zude page.

It has what it describes as a long-standing feud, both legal and philosophical , with Zynga over the free-to-play model and the ways in which the crumbling Farmville-creator has tarnished the moniker. For Kixeye's goal lies in convincing not just kids, but older players -- those with a craving to play who perhaps don't have the resources or time to invest in hundreds of dollars of hardware -- that it's a team of serious gamers making serious games, not cow-clickers .\n\"I have not met a single person here who is not a gamer,\" said Caryl Shaw, Backyard Monsters' executive producer. \"Even the finance guys,\" she added. Shaw left rival social games company Ngmoco to work for Kixeye, and previously spent years at EA working for its subsidiary Maxis, the creator of SimCity. She ditched the realm of major game publishing and development because it moved painfully slow, and involved years of working in a bubble only to release a game with little to no reassurance that it would be well-received.\n\"I worked on one game for three years,\" she said with slight exasperation. But right then, she noticed the time and promptly left the meeting room to travel one floor below -- to the Backyard Monsters mobile team -- so that they could prepare for the game to launch in yet another market when the clocked ticked 11 that morning. The game has only been in development for a little under nine months, but it's already ready to roll, and has been racking up responsive users in markets like Canada and New Zealand.\nAnd it will only get better from here. That's because launching a free-to-play game is not a chance to move on to the next project, but just the beginning.\nMoving to mobile without sacrifices \nDonna Tam/CNET\n\"Two and half years ago we weren't really thinking about mobile because frankly we were having too much success with the browser,\" said CEO Will Harbin, who came to Kixeye from social network-building company Affinity Labs. That was in 2011, and Kixeye had just rebranded after growing tremendously thanks to the original Backyard Monsters' success in 2009.\nBefore that, the company was known as Casual Collective, a much smaller outfit that got its start when developers David Scott and Paul Preece began designing flash games in 2007 as Facebook was gearing up to launch its social gaming platform.\nBut Backyard Monsters wasn't the first mobile title for any particular reason other than \"it was the first one ready,\" Harbin said. Kixeye had originally commissioned Ngmoco, from which it would later snag Shaw, for the job after the company offered to tackle the port, but the end result was so tattered and unusable that Kixeye killed it. \"We scrapped that relationship and build and started from scratch on our own,\" he added.\nThe challenges for Kixeye weren't in the platform, though working with Apple does impose speed limitations. Rather, Harbin said, his company had to ensure it wasn't diluting its core mission by jumping to mobile. That would be a move that the CEO said would fall in line with many mobile developers, but would be yet another way in which free-to-play preys on gamers. For instance, the more profitable mobile platform funnels development into a hit-and-run approach where games try to maximize downloads and keep users purchasing in-game currency, but with little incentive to keep playing.\nWill Harbin has been a controversial and outspoken source in the world of social games, specifically after Kixeye launched a profanity-ridden takedown of competitors in this satirical recruitment video. Screenshot by Nick Statt/CNET\n\"It's about maximizing fun. It's not just trying to artificially inflate retention,\" Harbin said. \"You've got to continue to delight millions of players week after week.\" For Kixeye, that means working on new features constantly. To this day, 2-year-old games like War Commander are updated frequently to keep the experience rewarding.\n\"Mobile is not the end all of be all to gaming platforms, which is why we're still doing browser and PC download,\" Harbin admitted, \"because there are certain genres that will not work and there are certain genres that we simply want to make because we want to play them.\"\n\"If this was just a business exercise, which it is for a lot of people out here making mobile games, we would just make mobile games,\" he said. It's no secret to game developers nowadays that mobile is more cost-efficient and drives more profit and revenue.\n\"That's not good enough for us,\" he said. \"The reason why I'm doing this company is because I want to make great games.\"\n'We're not afraid to get in and rip the guts out'\nWhere Kixeye's true strengths lie are in listening to players, tinkering, and getting titles to take off long after they've already been launched thanks to the low barrier to playing. It's a strategy that is utterly impossible for triple-A game studios making home console and pay-to-play PC titles.\nBrandon Barber, Kixeye's chief marketing officer, at the company's San Francisco headquarters. Donna Tam/CNET\n\"We're not afraid to, after the game launches, get in and rip the guts out and put it back together again if we think there's a better direction to take it,\" said Brandon Barber, Kixeye's chief marketing officer. Barber spent a chunk of his career at EA, which he ultimately left because it was \"so painful to move that battleship.\" At Kixeye, he notes that titles like Backyard Monsters and Vega Conflict languished for months until the teams were able to get the titles to catch on.\n\"It's not about swinging for the fence on our first release. If we get a double or a single even, we're going to learn a lot, and that's going to set us up for our next release,\" Barber added.\nHarbin also acknowledged that Kixeye has been late to the party in terms of getting to mobile, where games like Clash of Clans, \"a rip-off of Backyard Monsters,\" he said, have reached massive success as deep multiplayer strategy games.\n\"People invest a lot of resources and money in making a game, get to first launch, and it either fails or succeeds,\" Harbin said. If it does fail, he noted, developers will often leave it behind and move on.\n\"We don't do that here. We're always about learning and iterating,\" he said. It's Kixeye's free-to-play DNA -- an approach just now being fully realized by the gaming titans that have long ruled the industry -- that gives it that flexibility.\n\"We're not going to reclaim the throne with just one launch, but we're in this for the long run,\" Harbin said. \"It's not about winning against competitors. It's about delighting gamers.\"\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

By making the process faster, it's easier for a company to dig into analysis of the data.\nIn a release, the company explained the need for Chorus:\nGreenplum Chorus is a new class of software that empowers people within an enterprise to more easily collaborate and derive insight from their data. As the first commercial Enterprise Data Cloud platform, it provides the key services necessary for organizations wrestling with all data, big and small, structured and unstructured, to realize the benefits of private cloud computing techniques and social collaboration for enterprise data warehousing and analytics.\nThe second generation Exadata machine, announced by Oracle last fall , was built by Sun Microsystems, a move that made sense given the Oracle's acquisition of Sun. The first was launched in partnership with HP.\nPrevious: Teradata unveils cloud strategy, answer for Oracle's Exadata machine\nGreenplum's formal announcement of the product releases will be at a two-day event in Las Vegas called Greenplum Days , where Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy will deliver a keynote speech on Tuesday. In Greenplum's release, McNealy - now an executive adviser to the company - offered his thoughts on what Greenplum is doing to change the space:\nGreenplum’s EDC technology is driving a new era of safe, trusted sharing. Greenplum is breaking down the walls of the data warehouse with a wonderful, next-generation architecture that I think is very, very exciting and which could see very wide adoption in a very quick way.\nGreenplum execs called their news an important shift for the industry, a new kind of platform that allows companies to take more control of their data while doing so faster and more efficiently.\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

Every year, it seems, HBO makes an announcement just in time to provide more viewers with the ability to watch Game of Thrones.\nThis week, HBO announced that HBO NOW will be available to Xbox and Samsung Smart TV users ahead of Sunday’s Game of Thrones premiere.\n“The anticipation for Game of Thrones is at an all-time high so we’re thrilled to bring HBO NOW to Samsung TV users in time for the new season,” said Jeff Dallesandro, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Digital Distribution and Business Development, HBO. “By streaming HBO NOW directly on a Samsung TV, consumers can watch epic, event-level programming in premium quality on a big screen—making for a tremendous viewing experience.”\nWith competition coming from all sides, HBO knows just how important Game of Thrones is to its brand.\n“This weekend HBO will roll out its programming bell cow, Game of Thrones, which to no surprise is the central driver of digital content engagement for the company that brought us Tony Soprano,” said Assaf Henkin, SVP of Brand Intelligence at Amobee. \"But, is HBO putting too many (dragon) eggs in the Game of Thrones basket, as emerging content players such as Netflix, Amazon, Showtime, Hulu and Starz begin to plot their assent to the content throne? Time will tell if HBO has additional original programming to fuel its marketing and connection with subscribers.”\nAmobee measures digital content engagement across 600,000 sites on mobile, video, web and social. With Season 6 upon us, Amobee looked at content consumption habits around HBO and its flagship show, Game of Thrones:\n•  Game of Thrones is most strategically important to HBO generating interest for themselves as a standalone, over the top service. Between March 18, 2015 - April 18, 2016; 19% of all digital content engagement around either HBO or HBO Go was Game of Thrones related. In comparison during the same time period; 28% of all digital content engagement around HBO Now was Game of Thrones related.\n•  HBO doesn’t not have a deep bench of new content right now. Between March 18, 2015 - April 18, 2016; there was at least 4.2X more digital content around Game of Thrones than around any other program on HBO, with Vice generating the next most HBO related digital content engagement. In the same time period; Game of Thrones generated 4.9X more HBO related digital content engagement than Girls; the comedy with the most HBO related digital content engagement; and 6.3X more HBO related digital content engagement than True Detective; the HBO drama with the next more channel related digital content engagement. Vinyl which was supposed to be HBO’s next great program; only generated 6% as much HBO related digital content engagement as Game of Thrones in the last 13 months.\n•  Since the last original episode of Game of Thrones came out; looking at June 14, 2015 - April 18, 2016; 17% of all Game of Thrones related digital content engagement has been John Snow related; as the audience speculates if he’s really dead or not. In comparison in the same time period; only 6% of Game of Thrones related digital content engagement was around Tyrion Lannister, the fan favorite with the next highest amount of digital interest around him.\n•  Game of Thrones is the undisputed biggest show on television right now. In the last three months; meaning January 18 - April 18, there was 24% more digital content engagement around Game of Thrones than around The Walking Dead; even though The Walking Dead was in-season and Game of Thrones wasn’t. That reflects the level of interest in the return of GoT; and disappointment in the Negan themed TWD storyline, where a major character was supposedly killed; and it won’t be revealed which one until the show returns next Fall.\n", "deleted" : false }

Kent is now walking away from the sector.\nRobin Kent, former SpiralFrog CEO. Rebel Digital\nOn Tuesday, Kent notified associates that after three years working almost exclusively for Qtrax , he will no longer provide consulting services to the much maligned legal peer-to-peer company, which is only available in a few overseas markets. Qtrax has become something of a running joke in the music sector, as it has become notable for its many broken promises about licensing deals and failed attempts to launch in the United States.\nAt SpiralFrog, Kent kicked off his foray into digital-music with a bang. He managed to help attract millions in funding for the start-up, which proposed to offer song downloads free to the public and support them by selling ads. The New York Times and other publications wondered whether SpiralFrog might lure illegal file sharers away from pirate sites and someday challenge iTunes .\nIt never came close to meeting that potential. New York-based SpiralFrog shut down last year after racking up more than $40 million in debt and attempting to prop up traffic numbers with all kinds of iffy marketing schemes. Kent was long gone by that time. He left the company in December 2006 following a struggle for control of SpiralFrog with founder Joe Mohen.\nAfter moving to Qtrax, Kent watched the public relations debacle that followed when founder and CEO Allan Klepfisz made claims to have licensed music from all four major labels, only to see the record companies deny there were any deals. That was followed by a string of missed U.S. launch dates and legal problems involving unpaid bills .\nAs for his future, Kent said in his farewell e-mail that \"I'm very excited about some new ventures that I will be announcing in the not too distant future.\" He told CNET only that the new ventures have nothing to do with digital music.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

This week, build 10036 has leaked. Perhaps its most interesting new feature? It'll support peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading of both apps and operating system updates.\nPeer-to-peer downloads will be optional, and if enabled they will support two modes: systems will be able to either retrieve updates from other machines on the same local network, or from both the local network and PCs on the Internet.\nWith Windows moving to a model that sees Microsoft releasing more updates more often, this is a natural addition. While not a problem faced by enterprise deployments, having multiple Windows systems in the home tends to make updating rather bandwidth hungry. Every machine on a network needs to download updates itself, and with major updates sometimes weighing in at several gigabytes, this can waste a lot of time and, for those on metered connections, burn through the precious bandwidth allowance.\nEnterprises have been able to avoid this wastage through WSUS (Windows Server Update Services), which downloads the updates once to a local update server. Machines then use this as the source of their patches.\nIt's not immediately clear what technology is used for the peer-to-peer patching. Windows has included its own P2P API since Windows XP Service Pack 1, but this API appears to be used by little or no software. In 2013, Microsoft bought Pando Networks , a company developing BitTorrent-like P2P software that included dedicated servers and smart bandwidth throttling. This would feel like a natural fit for Windows patch distribution.\n", "deleted" : false }

The thinking went something along these lines:  Intel's chips needed APIs to enable a whole bunch of higher-level services, and by acquiring a company that was all about enabling API creation and management, it could do that better.\nLike I said, you needed to squint really, really hard for it to make sense.\nIt seems that the decision-makers within Intel had mastered their squinting but have since sought some help from high-performance ophthalmologists, since they have decided to flick off Mashery to a company that actually makes sense to own it, Tibco . Tibco is, after all, a vendor that spends all of its time focusing on providing connections between applications and data ± in the brave new world, that is the role of the API, and hence Mashery is pretty applicable to what Tibco does.\nFor Intel, however,  it was a case of throwing good money away and a perfect example of why some publicly traded companies get the unwanted attention of activist investors (but for all the wrong reasons). It kind of goes like this: Legacy public vendor starts to lose market share or revenue growth, and hence activist investor pricks up his or her ears and goes in for the kill. Fearing the wrath of said activist investor, publicly listed company CEO gets a rush of blood to the head and goes on a shopping spree, acquiring cool new companies in an effort to revitalize the original business. Of course, these acquisitions are generally done without having a clue about the applicability of the new business to the primary business, but at least it gets rid of the activist investors for a while.\nAnd the crime of it all is that what the activist investors should really be getting antsy about are hare-brained acquisitions like Intel buying Mashery. That $200 million? That was some shareholder dividends flushed down the toilet. Sigh.\nPS: The picture I chose to go with this article doesn't indicate the amazing convergence of the human mind with technology.

You’re on a bus or sitting outside a coffee shop or walking down the street, reading and responding to email after email on your smartphone, and then you reach the point where your smartphone just doesn’t cut it. “I’ll deal with this when I get back to a real computer,” you tell yourself.\nJavier Soltero wants to fix that. “There’s a category of email you simply don’t deal with on your phone,” says the 39-year-old engineer and serial entrepreneur, and with his new company, Acompli , a startup based in San Francisco, he aims to close this hole in your mobile life. The company offers a new kind of mobile email app designed to “get you closer to the actions and information you need.”\n‘There’s a category of email you simply don’t deal with on your phone.’\nLaunched late last month, the app offers various shortcuts that accelerate common tasks, like letting someone know you’re running late, finding a contact you recently emailed, locating a work document that’s been bouncing around your inbox, or scheduling an appointment. And if you install it on your phone, it can tie straight into a Microsoft Exchange email server, the email system still favored by most big corporations. In other words, you can revamp your work email without help from your IT department.\nApple and Google — the giants of the smartphone world — have already remade the way we deal with work email, offering email clients on iPhones and Android devices that supplement desktop systems. This is why Blackberry — once the king of mobile email inside businesses — is now in its death throes. But Soltero and Acompli want to take this trend even further, believing that Apple and Google still don’t make our lives easy enough.\nPart of the issue, Soltero says, is that we must improve the way mobile email works with Microsoft Exchange. Web services like Gmail are already a big improvement over the past, but not everyone can make that switch. “The world doesn’t run on Google Apps,” he says. “Planet Earth runs on Exchange. For better or worse, it is the email and collaboration system in use by over 600 million people.”\nNo Stupid Ideas\nSilicon Valley may be obsessed with a very different kind of mobile app — smartphone software that deals in stuff like anonymous gossip and self-destructing pictures — but Soltero, who worked on the seminal Netscape web browser in the ’90s, see things quite differently. “I’m not the guy who’s going to go build Secret or Instagram or any of these things. That’s just not me,” he says. “Maybe being out here 20 years has jaded me to no end. I’m like: ‘That’s the stupidest fucking idea I’ve ever heard in my life.'” The real opportunity, he believes, lies in just fixing the basic things that all of us do every day.\nJavier Soltero. Photo: Ariel Zambelich/WIRED\nThe idea for Acompli arose after Soltero sold his server-monitoring company, Hyperic, which ended up in the hands of virtualization software maker VMWare. As a VMware chief technology officer, he found himself in deep in the corporate world, where everything was handled using ancient email software and other clunky tools like Microsoft PowerPoint. “It just seemed very inefficient,” he says.\nThus began a long obsession with the way people collaborate inside large corporations, or “the enterprise,” as such companies are collectively known in technology circles. After seeing the incredibly fast rise of Gentry Underood’s Mailbox — which Dropbox bought for a reported $100 million one month after launch — Soltero eventually set his sights on corporate inboxes. If you used an corporate Exchange service, it was hard to enter data. It was hard to find things. And it was hard to join your email to other apps. So he started Acompli.\nBeyond Google\nThe first incarnation of the company’s app at least begins to move things in the right direction. When writing or reading an email, you can pull up a toolbar that includes calendar and location icons. By clicking on either, you can instantly complete certain common tasks, like checking your schedule and inviting someone to a meeting, or telling someone else you’re en route to meet them and attaching your current location. The idea is that you shouldn’t have to leave your email client to perform related tasks.\nYou can also view your email in new and potentially useful ways. You can pop open a list of people you’ve recently corresponded with, or you can quickly browse the message attachments you’ve recently received.\nThough the app takes square aim at those people using Microsoft Exchange inside big businesses, it can also plug into new-age email services that operate over the web, including Google Apps, Apple’s iCloud, and, soon, Microsoft’s web services. Soltero sees the app as something that can go far beyond what you get if you get from Google and Apple.\nThe Competition\nCertainly, despite providing big improvements over older mobile email systems, tools from Google and Apple still need improving. As Soltero points out, there remains things you’d rather do on a desktop PC. But the rub here is that Google and Apple can so quickly expand their tools as well, and they have a shorter path to people’s hearts. After all, they control the phones.\n“No doubt, it’s going to be very hard to just out-feature the native clients, especially with Google not asleep at the wheel,” says Matt Murphy, a partner with big name venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, where he runs the iFund, a fund dedicated to iPhone apps. Murphy also points out that others are taking a similar tack, including a company called Any.do.\nIn Through the Back Door\nAnd that’s the way Soltero likes it. He sees nothing but horizon, believing that people would rather stay inside their email app than back and forth to other tools. He and his 20-person team look at the current version of the app as a mere starting point. The broader aim is to create an email app that does everything you can do on a desktop PC — from a single interface. “When you’re using a regular computer you don’t notice how you go from an email to a tab on your browser or another window to deal with whatever that email is asking you to deal with, whether it’s scheduling an appointment or finding a file or editing a document,” he says.\nAs for revenue, there isn’t any yet, since the Acompli app is free. But the plan is to sell tools to corporate IT staffs that will help them manage Acompli on employee phones. Like many other outfits — from Box.com to Evernote — Acompli wants to change corporate American by appealing to employees first. It’s called the “consumerization of IT.”\nThat’s how Accompli is different from companies like Good , which also seeks to remake corporate email. Unlike Acompli, Good comes through the front door at big businesses, selling both smartphone apps and management tools to IT departments. Acompli is more concerned with the people using the phones. For Soltero, these are the people who need the most help.\n", "deleted" : false }

It's Americas leading casual gay dating site. (MyPartnerPerfect.com sits at the other end of the spectrum as the gay eHarmony , with Patrick Perrine ). I talked to Jonathan Crutchley ManHunt's chairman of the board. - Mark Brooks\nWhat’s the founding story of Manhunt.net ?\nI have a business partner, Larry Basile, who invited me to be his business partner in 1992 in a gay telephone chat service in Boston, Dial Information Services. I bought out his existing partner and we went into the telephone chat line business together, in Boston. He founded the business in 1987.\nIt’s a local business that made a reasonable amount of money but around 2000 we noticed that our youngest users, 18 to early 20’s, weren’t using our service as much as they had. Boston has 300,000 college students and a good part of our market was young people 18 – 22. Whenever they arrive for school in the fall we advertise in the gay magazines and newspapers locally to tell the newcomers about our chat line service and they weren’t responding. We figured it was because they were using the Internet.\nWe made a decision to get a website launched, persuade people to use it and then persuade people to pay to use it.  At that time most people didn’t believe in paying. \nBy trial and error, mostly error, we got some people to design a website for us. Neither my business partner nor I knew anything about the Internet. Then we advertised locally. It took about 2 years to grow to 10,000 users for free services at www.manhunt.net . Then at one point in the year 2002, we sent all of our users an email and said, “We hope you’ve enjoyed using Manhunt these past 2 years but now we’re going to ask you to pay $10 a month for the service.” We held our breath, sat back and to our great surprise they paid. People told us that they appreciated the service so much it was worth paying for and that they understood.\nAfter we found out that people were willing to pay for this, we realized the Internet goes everywhere not just Boston. So we decided to open up the website to users in New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, coast to coast USA. We promoted it with advertisements in gay magazines and newspapers, held events at gay bars and nightclubs. I started traveling to various locations promoting our website and it caught on coast to coast in the USA. Now we have over 600,000 US members and 900,000+ members worldwide. We’ve translated Manhunt into German, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese, and Italian is in process. We’re in Europe and Asia and Australia and North and South America. So it’s really taken off.\nI’m quite surprised at the massive popularity of Gaydar in the U.K. Hitwise ranks them as the top dating site in the U.K.\nThey were there first. If you noticed, they’re way behind us in the USA. I admire them. They offer an excellent service to their members, but eventually, just like Pepsi caught up with Coca-Cola, it took them 100 years, and I don’t know how long it’s going to take us to catch up with Gaydar but we’ll catch up to Gaydar sooner or later in the U.K.\nTo what do you attribute your successes so far with Manhunt.net?\nWhat our members tell us is it’s easy to use. We have very prompt customer service. I’ve got 30 guys who work shifts 24 hours a day and speak all these different languages answering emails and calls on our 800 number. If guys have a problem, guys have a question, credit card billing issues, and things like that, they send us an email and in 10 minutes they get an answer. If you go on most other dating websites you’ll find they’ll say, “We’ll get back to you in the next 2 or 3 days to answer your question.”\nWe’ve invested in customer service because the gay community is a community and people are comfortable using our site because there’s somebody on the other end they can talk to and they have the confidence to use our site and subscribe to it.\nHow fast is the site growing at this stage?\nLet’s just say that revenues are growing 50% a year now. Sooner or later that’s going to level off but we keep going to new countries and they think we’re the best thing since sliced bread.\nDoes the gay dating market tend towards being casual or does it tend towards being long term relationship oriented?\nObviously, this question is not being asked by a gay man. I have to explain this frequently to straight people who ask me this. It’s casual. When I compare our dating website with a boy meets girl dating website, what happens on a boy meets girl dating website is boy meets girl, boy dates girl, boy marries girl because many of these sites are inclined toward promoting marriage, which is fine.\nThe difference between that and my website is boy meets boy, boy dates boy, tomorrow night boy dates another boy, the next night boy dates another boy. Especially with the younger crowd from age 18 to 40 that’s the way young gay men live. They get out and about, they go out to bars and nightclubs and they see a lot of people. Whereas, with Match.com or True or eHarmony , once a couple has met and dated and married, that website has lost two customers. But once I get a customer, if they like us and they subscribe, they just put their credit card on automatic rebill and they renew and renew and renew and we grow.\nThe reason I asked was, Gayparship.co.uk launched recently and they did a survey (1,000 responses) and found that 47% of gay men were looking for a serious, long term relationship compared to just 16% that were looking for casual flings. That didn’t quite ring true.  What are your thoughts on that?\nThey may be looking for Mr. Right but Mr. Right Now will do. I would say that most gay men are probably looking some day for a long term relationship. Sooner or later we all settle down for a while but then they still subscribe to my website and look at the pictures. But still in the meantime, gay men will casually date.  Also, we estimate that as many as 30% of our users are married men.\nWhich of the mainstream sites is most popular amongst the gay audience?  I heard that Yahoo Personals is popular amongst the gay audience.\nI honestly can’t imagine that, I don’t understand why. Gay men are looking for their own community and I’ve gone and looked at, for instance, Match.com and Yahoo Personals and we do market research with these others, but a website operated by straight people just does not register with gay men. The questions, when you fill out their questionnaires the questions that a woman would ask a man when she’s looking for someone to marry, like how much money do you make, do you want children? These are ridiculous questions, a gay man could care less how much money you make, could care less about wanting children. They want to know your physical attributes, they want to see pictures, they want to know what you’re into.\nMy website is an adult website and men pose in adult photographs, they post naked pictures of themselves and some guys will subscribe just to look at the pictures rather then go to the newsstand and buy a magazine and see the pictures. So that’s what men are interested in and the people who run straight dating websites with a gay niche in it have no clue. I don’t think that they’re serious competition.\nYou’re ranked by Hitwise as the 10th most trafficked dating site in the U.S.A., and gay.com is 14th. How so?\nGay.com doesn’t consider themselves a competitor of ours. They’ve said they’re going in a different direction. They’re going into the magazine publishing business, they’re going for advertising revenues, they’re going into the travel industry, they chartered the Queen Mary. They’re looking for the Fortune 500 to advertise in their properties, their magazine or their website properties. That’s what they want to do.\nWe stick to our knitting and we’re just in the personals business and the personals business only. I have no cruises up and down the Danube or Atlantic crossings from New York to Southampton. I have none of that.\nDo you believe in offline advertising or do you believe in purely online?\nWe’re an Internet business but actually we did promote and we do promote our website in gay magazines and newspapers, but the trouble with that is if you pick up the newspaper and you want to connect to our website you can’t push a button on the page to get there. The way you get traffic is on the Internet. It’s generally more effective for word-of-mouth to get people to come to your site and create links to your site, and things like that.  If someone has no clue as where to find a date and enters gay dating on Google they’ll find us.\nWhat are your goals for 2007 for Manhunt.net?\nTo grow the business, it’s a big, big world and I only have around a million members and there are billions of people in this world.\nAre you going to the Shanghai conference in China?\nOh yes, definitely. I’ll be there. Actually I’ve made contacts already in China that tell me that Gay.com and Gaydar are already marketing there. We plan to offer our service in China. We plan to offer our service in India. We are international and I’ve got a lot of work to do in the next 20 years.\nApr 22, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

I often inform prospective dating industry entrepreneurs to shoot for a niche, or plan on raising $10 million+ if they want to build a generic dating site. Saïd tells me that building a niche dating site is not that easy these days. Many search terms have been bid through the roof on the search engines. – Mark Brooks\nWhat's your background Saïd?\nI was born in Iran. I lived there for three years before moving to Paris. Five years later, once my mother finished her PhD work at the Sorbonne, we moved to the US.\nProfessionally, I worked at Fannie Mae in Washington DC for several years after graduating from Clark University in Massachusetts. My responsibilities at Fannie Mae ran the gamut from admin work, to project manager. While at Fannie Mae, I had the good fortune of getting lots of exposure at the executive level and learned a lot from the experience. It's really a top notch company with very talented and politically well connected folks.\nFrom there I went on to work for a small telecommunications company specializing in Voice Over IP, with operations in over 45 countries. I was in charge of business development and implementation for East Africa and the Middle East. My work had me traveling extensively between Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, the UAE, Bahrain and Yemen.\nThe nature of the work was quite risky and illegal in the countries where we operated. It entailed getting a trustworthy partner, successfully getting our equipment into the country and then setting up hardware like a 2.4 meter dish at our partners' location without getting caught by the authorities. Man, the crazy stories I could share about this job. I loved that it was such an adventure and challenge. \nWhy did you start World Singles ?\nIn my mid 20s I had an itch for connecting with like minded Iranian Americans and was tired of working for others. The Internet and all of its possibilities for bringing people together was blowing me away and so, after launching a few niche online sites for fun, IranianPersonals.com was born. There was very little competition in the Iranian market and I thought that I could do better than the Iranian dating service that many were using at the time. Having traveled extensively my whole life and as someone who embraces diversity, I thought to myself, why not offer a similar service to other ethnic groups.\nWorld Singles was created in 2001. Michel, who at the time was my web designer for IranianPersonals.com and other sites, became my partner – he taught himself Cold Fusion and built our dating application from scratch; a rather brilliant dude if I may say so and more importantly, he's a great guy.\nThe first thing I looked to do with World Singles was target ethnic niches that had little to no competition from other niche dating services. World Singles was operating on fumes; I think that my initial investment was a mere 10 or 12 thousand dollars with even less in reserves. Bootstrapping it, we really had no choice but to go after those \"blue oceans\" and went at it for several years without pay. Heck, for a while we tweaked our business and offered a private label service because we could not afford to advertise on any of the niche sites that could drive traffic to our sites. Once money started coming in, we managed to reverse our deals with sites using our private label service in favor of pushing our own brands. To this day, we have not taken any outside investment.\nWhat sites have inspired you?\nThe netzine Iranian.com was a huge source of inspiration. I first stumbled upon it back in 1999/2000 and I think that it was the first time that I came across a niche site that offered compelling content that brought Iranians worldwide together through articles and comments. I remember thinking, damn, where did all these Iranian Americans come from? Very cool.\nDating sites that inspire…mmm...despite rejecting my profile a few years back because I was deemed not pious enough, I generally like eHarmony 's angle – they introduced a new way to find matches. The industry has not seen that sort of creativity in some time. I definitely like to check Match.com regularly. They are always up to something, testing this or that.\n \nOther sites…hmm, I really take something from every site but the Internet as a whole is inspiring. It's alive, evolving and has amazing reach. The world is shrinking.\nWhat is Nuzizo ?\nNuzizo is a social network that my good friend Darren Romeo and I launched a few months back. It's an online city and culture engine that brings together dozens of ethnic and lifestyle communities. Rather than launching stand alone ethnic sites, we created a place that unites people from all backgrounds and celebrates culture. Operating as a portal, Nuzizo City offers a great opportunity to make connections with people from similar and different backgrounds. Again, the world is shrinking.\nThe site is still in beta, but we really believe that in time, Nuzizo City will be one of the most visited sites on the Internet. My mother, knowing how passionate I am about this project, enthusiastically asks me several times a week, \"Has Nuzizo taken off yet? Does it have millions of users yet?\" She's very cute but I politely remind her to exercise patience. After all, great cities like NYC and Rome were not built overnight.\nWhat are your goals for 2007/2008?\nWell, for starters I'm looking for us to more than double World Singles revenue in 2008. We have been giving away so many features for free. For example, it's currently free to read and reply to messages on all World Singles sites. We won't go as far as charging people to read emails, but members will soon be required to pay for some of the features that are currently free. Until recently we operated with only one programmer and limited staff. In the last few months we have hired some quality folks who are helping us get through our \"to do\" list faster. As a result, we're getting better at converting our traffic and the extra horses have freed me up to do more business development. In the next few weeks, we will be announcing several overseas partnerships with highly trafficked sites and I am looking to launch two ethnic niche sites that I feel are wide open and there for the taking.

Detour — an immersive city guide app constructed around GPS-triggered audio and smart, witty narratives — is expanding beyond its existing footprint of San Francisco and Austin to cover New York and five international cities: Barcelona, Berlin, London, Marrakech and Paris.\nAs with the current selection of guides, downloading the app will be free, and users can then purchase individual tours — $5 each in the U.S. and $8 in Europe and Marrakech — or sign up for a  subscription  with unlimited guides for $20/year.\nThe move comes as Detour, notably founded by Groupon co-founder and former CEO Andrew Mason, continues to work on its bigger ambition as a business: a platform for anyone to create an immersive guide for a particular place. Mason tells me that the aim is to have a private beta of the platform open by the end of this year, with a broader expansion in 2016.\nSince Detour’s  launch almost a year ago , the startup has been straddling two sides of its business. The first of these has been on the content creation side. Specifically, it’s been building out its catalog of guides in its home market of San Francisco, where Detour is currently adding new tours at the rate of one each month, employing a team of sound and tech engineers as well as radio producers to craft the guides.\nIt’s that team of people working on the SF content that are also helping lay the bedrock for the second side of the business: the platform for making future guides.\nThe challenge, as Mason describes it, is that producing each audio guide can take three to four months, not only sourcing content but also recording and coding it to progress based on your location. So Detour is trying to figure out a way of using technology to make that process faster and easier. The result would be that Detour could crowdsource content for its app, but it would also mean more ideas for what gets produced in the first place.\nPart of this has been inspired by people’s responses to Detour since launch, Mason says. “People have been writing in and offering ideas to us completely outside the bounds of what we are offering,” he says. “We would be doing a disservice if we were only allowing ourselves to create Detours.”\nA few pieces of the puzzle have already been put into place.\nFor example, Detour has created a tool to transcribe a piece of audio and then let you edit the actual audio file by editing that written transcription (which frankly sounds very cool and useful for more than just Detour if you’ve ever gone through the task of editing audio).\nAnother piece of code that Detour has built lets a producer program music or other recorded sound under a spoken narrative by writing it into that transcription. Behind your notation, Detour automatically shapes the audio to sit under the spoken voice.\nTo be clear, however, Detour doesn’t see itself as in that same category of startups that create instant videos out of a piece of text , or instant  articles out of press releases .\n“There is no outcome where talented people aren’t still required to make Detours, but we’d like to reduce the technical requirement needed to do it,” Mason says. This is part of the reason for employing a staff to create a lot of the content in house today, he explains. “We are trying to understand what happens in their brains.”\nWithin that context, Mason describes the newest additions as “previews” of what Detour may offer in the future. The New York content is actually based on audio “essays” created by Soundwalk (“audio tours for people who don’t normally take audio tours”) some time ago.\n“Soundwalk has been making low tech but high qualty outdoor audio walks,” Mason notes. Detour essentially reissued some of the older walks, having run them through the Detour platform to add group listening and location triggers. “We gave them the platform they always deserved,” he added.\nThe walks in European cities and Marrakech, meanwhile, were also created out of house, albeit by a close associate of Mason’s. Aaron With, a former Groupon employee that Mason actually credits with thinking up the company’s name, created the guides working with local producers in each city. These are still in the irreverent style of what Detour has created in SF — one walk in London’s Westminster, for example, is led by a fictitious, whiskey-swilling government bureaucrat called Henry Adeane (very close to home for me; my husband is a senior civil servant). But for now don’t expect the same pace of adding new guides in these cities as Detour has done in San Francisco.\nDetour challenges: Angry Birds and Oculus\nThe content part of the equation is just one of the many hurdles Detour still faces. Another is around the technical aspects of the service. Right now, using the GPS to essentially propel a user through a tour is very draining to the battery — some tours can take up to 30% of your battery life. Mason says they’re constantly working on ways of reducing that — such as being more selective about GPS engagement and optimizations in how maps are rendered, as well as distributing battery load when in a group — but that there is still some way to go here.\n“This is a concern as it is for anybody trying to build mobile experiences, espcially since we’re sending people out to the wild and we need to make sure the battery lasts.”\nHe says that in an ideal situation you are not actually using your phone all that much and concentrating instead on what is around you, although that can’t always be controlled. “In the beginning we decided detour should be a phone in pocket experience and the entire experience is through your headphones. And when people do keep their phone in their pocket that takes care of largest battery drain. The people who have the worst experiencees are those who are Instagramming or playing Angry Birds at the same time.”\nAnother is the fact that for now the app is still only on iOS. Needing to add an Android app has been one of Mason’s brutal awakenings, he says. “Android is more important than we thought it would be, which i hate.” Detour has found that roughly one third of people in a would-be group will be using an Android handset. “So if you have a group of three or more, chances are they can’t take a Detour together. You are only as strong as your weakest link.”Android is coming later this year, he says hopefully.\nWhen Ryan first wrote about Detour last year, he described the app as a “content-centric” approach to travel guides, more of a story telling experience than a fact-based travel guide: think “This American Life” personalised to a specific location, with the narration moving along as you do. In that regard, it may be hard to think of how Detour correlates to Mason’s previous entrepreneurial endeavor, sometimes mocked for some of its less high-minded offerings .\nBut there is less of a tenuous connection between Groupon and Detour than you might think. One of the mainstays of the Groupon catalog of deals are “experiences,” selling not just products and beauty sessions, but parachuting trips, boat cruises and other activities that are about discovery and fun. When you think about it, a new activity is also what Detour is trying to bring to users, albeit with a more interactive, constant companion style.\nThat also brings to mind also where Detour has competition, but maybe also where it might have some opportunities longer term as a business: there are a lot of companies out there already in the travel and leisure sector focussing on apps for getting around and discovering cities, from biggies like TripAdvisor and Rough Guides through to VC-backed startups like Peek and Dojo and long-tail efforts that may not look slick but are full of information .\nDetour tries to set itself apart from the others in part because it’s more than just information; it attempts to take that detail and put it into an immersive media experience.\n“It’s not just about information and experience,” Mason says. “It’s about helping people walk in someone else’s shoes and form a deeper connection to people who identify with a place.”\nIndeed, he doesn’t see any of these other location-based or travel businesses as competition for what Detour is trying to do. “We see Oculus as the competition,” he says. “Our job is to make the real world more interesting again.”\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

I went to Harvey Mudd.\nSramana Mitra: What did you do after that?\nRay Grainger: Based on that realization in college that I would pursue a career of applying technology to business, I went to Accenture directly out of college and ended up being part of the Products group there involving building technology and consulting in the high-tech industry. I had an 18-year-career there and ended up being a Global Managing Partner of the high-tech industry at Accenture.\nSramana Mitra: You stayed there for a while.\nRay Grainger: I did. Accenture is a highly entrepreneurial organization. Every client and every project is kind of its own little business. I knew that going in when I was actually interviewing. What appealed to me is that I could be a partner someday in a company versus an employee. The idea of being a business owner was very important to me right out of college.\nThe way that the work was done was you had to think about what markets you were going to pursue, what clients would benefit from your offerings, and you had to pursue business. That really appealed to me. Even though it was part of a big organization, I could be an intrapreneur.\nSramana Mitra: You develop a lot of relationships. That’s a job that enables you to build a lot of high-level relationships.\nRay Grainger: Exactly. As we talk, maybe that network that I was able to build will come out.\nSramana Mitra: Were you based out of Southern California while you were working on Accenture?\nRay Grainger: Yes. I was based out of our Los Angeles office. Because it was high-tech, I served clients all over the globe. I spent time in Japan with Sony. There were companies where we really tried to save and get into the new world like Kodak. There were some difficult and perplexing problems.\nSramana Mitra: What years were your Accenture gig?\nRay Grainger: It was early 1988 until late 2005.\nSramana Mitra: In the meantime, Internet gets invented and all kinds of new things happen. The dot-com bubble and bust happened. This is the period where you were developing your network and career at Accenture. What happens next?\nRay Grainger: My transition into the next stage occurred during the one point that you mentioned – when the Internet was first forming. The concept of Mavenlink was born. 1992 was the time when we were all pursuing the information super highway. What are we going to do with this new Internet? I was looking at how services would be transformed.\nThe genesis of Mavenlink was formed way back then. It was in 2005 after knowing what the foundational elements would need to be in order to do Mavenlink. The Software-as-a-Service had become a viable model. NetSuite and Salesforce had proven that it could be a viable model. The social web had emerged. Mavenlink has a social dynamic to it. The social web had started to get traction. People would put themselves out on the web as individuals.\nAll of these things came together. I left Accenture to join a startup that I had invested in through our venture firm at Accenture. I wanted to be inside a software company versus just consulting. I wanted to be inside running one. I left Accenture and joined InQuira. Ultimately, we were acquired by Oracle.\n", "deleted" : false }

Among other things, wireless specialist Aruba added Ethernet switches to its architecture and Meraki took administration of both network components into the cloud. Rivals Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Cisco Systems snapped up both of those companies.\nNow Dell has gotten into the game, not by acquisition but through a partnership with WLAN vendor Aerohive Networks. On Tuesday, the two companies are introducing a unified management tool called HiveManager NG.\nThe system extends Aerohive’s own management software to oversee Dell’s N Series wired edge switches. With one dashboard for monitoring and configuring both, it basically turns all edge infrastructure into a single network. This simplifies management so much that it can save enterprises time and money, the vendors said.\nThe latest generation of Wi-Fi surpasses desktop Ethernet’s typical speed of 1Gbps (bit per second), making it a central part of enterprise LANs and increasingly the main way users connect.\n“There comes a point when the desktop or mobile user will not need to plug in,” Dell’Oro Group analyst Chris DePuy said.\nThe new version of Wi-Fi, called 802.11ac Wave 2, is also good business for wired network vendors. The faster speed is forcing enterprises to upgrade both their access points and the switches that feed them, using a new form of Ethernet designed just for this purpose. That's bringing wired and wireless companies together, and the Aerohive partnership is a way for Dell to play that game, DePuy said.\nHiveManager NG is a strictly software platform that runs in public or private clouds, so the data and controls can be reached from anywhere. Dell and Aerohive expect some large enterprises to buy the software for in-house deployment, while smaller customers will turn to public clouds. Service and support from Dell, which also will span wired and wireless, can be included in the package.\nUnified management can save enterprises money and time by making it easier to solve network users’ problems on the first call, said David Greene, Aerohive’s senior vice president and chief marketing officer. The HiveManager NG dashboard will let front-line tech support resolve issues more often without having to pass them on to specialists.\nAmong other things, the system performs continuous monitoring of basic conditions like who was on the network when and whether connections were working.

Shutterstock\nI have a confession to make: I paid a credit card bill late. As a  result, my credit score tumbled. It happened pretty quickly.\nYou’re probably thinking that I shouldn’t be making these kinds  of mistakes given that I’m a personal finance  journalist. But I have a really good excuse (sort of).\nRead: 20 Easy Ways Millennials Can Boost Their  Credit\nWhy my credit score dropped\nIn addition to a rewards credit card that I often use, I have  another card that I rarely use. Several months ago, I made a  purchase with that card. However, I never received a statement by  mail because I had forgotten that I’d signed up for electronic  statements when I got the card years ago. Consequently, the bill  for my purchase went to an email address I had stopped using.\nAs you might have guessed, I had forgotten about the purchase. It  didn’t even cross my mind that I hadn’t seen a bill from that  credit card issuer so I didn’t realize that I was late on a  payment.\nFortunately, a credit score update alert from Credit Karma tipped  me off that something was amiss. Credit Karma is a credit  monitoring service that provides you with free access to your  credit report and Vantage 3.0 credit score. It will send email  alerts when changes to your score are reported. I had signed up  for the service after I researched it for an article.\nThe Credit Karma email update showed that my Vantage credit score  was 718 out of a possible 850. I was surprised because the credit  card I regularly use provides me with my FICO credit score each  month on my statement. It had been 800 out of a possible 850 on  my last statement.\nThere can be variance among consumers’ credit scores because the  credit reporting agencies look at the same factors when  calculating scores but sometimes weigh those factors differently,  said Bethy Hardeman, chief consumer advocate at Credit Karma . The difference  between my FICO and Vantage scores was big enough to make me look  harder at the Credit Karma alert. What I discovered was that I  had a delinquent account.\nWithin days, I got a paper statement from the credit card company  informing me that my account was more than 30 days past due. I  logged onto my account and paid my bill, then got on the phone  with customer service.\nFlickr  / Tim Parkinson\nHow I boosted my score\nI briefly explained my story to the customer service  representative and pointed out that I had never missed a payment  in the past and had always paid my balance in full. Then I begged  her — yes, begged — to please reach out to the  three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, to  remove the delinquent payment from my report. She said she would  try but couldn’t promise anything.\nThat call paid off. I got a letter from my card issuer that it  submitted a request to those three major credit reporting bureaus  to remove the delinquency. Not long after that, I got an alert  from Credit Karma showing that my credit score had jumped 76  points to 794 because my account had improved from delinquent  status.\n“If you have a long history with your issuer and haven’t had  missed payments before, they are human beings on the other end of  the phone,” Hardeman said. “They can choose to empathize with  you. They want to keep your business as a customer. Sometimes  they will make exceptions in order to do that.”\nSo part of my success was due to the fact that I had been a good  customer until my slip up and part of it had to do with my  approach. Hardeman said that the customer service representative  likely was willing to help because I asked politely rather than  making a demand. “Be friendly and have a good attitude,” she  said. “That will go a long way.”\nCardholders in good standing shouldn’t hesitate to ask that a  late fee, or even an annual fee, be waived. They also should feel  free to request a change in their payment due date, to ask for an  increase in their credit limit or to seek a lower interest rate,  Hardeman said. There’s no guarantee the card issuer will comply.  But “what do you have to lose by asking?” she said.\nShutterstock\nWhy late payments or errors should be disputed\nWhen I called my credit card issuer’s customer service, I was  more concerned about getting my delinquent payment removed from  my credit report than having the late fee for my missed payment  waived. Why? Because your credit score affects the interest rate  you pay when you borrow. It affects rates on mortgages, car  loans, credit cards, insurance premiums and other services.\nHardeman said that borrowers typically need a credit score of at  least 720 to get the most favorable rates. So my 718 score  could’ve prevented me from obtaining the best loan or credit  terms. And that would’ve cost a lot more over time than one late  fee.\nYour payment history makes up about 30 percent to 35 percent of  your credit score, Hardeman said. That’s why a late  payment can make your score tumble as mine had. And that’s  why it’s important to make credit card and loan payments on time.  If you need help keeping track , use free apps such as  Mint Bills to get reminders when payments are due.\nIt’s important to keep tabs on your credit score because  reporting errors are more common than you might think. As many as  one in four consumers have such errors on their report and that  could affect their credit score, Hardeman said. If you find an  error, dispute it with the credit bureaus, which have 30 days to  investigate. More than 80 percent of the time, the disputes are  resolved in consumers’ favor, she said.\nIn addition to Credit Karma, services like Credit.com,  CreditSesame.com and Quizzle.com also provide customers with a  version of their credit score free of charge. You can also  get a free copy of your credit report annually from each of the  three major credit bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com.\n", "deleted" : false }

That comes at the same time many developers are enamored with Google's technical chops, along with some of the technical capabilities of its platform. \nGartner Vice President Lydia Leong said that Google is a company that has always had a lot of promise as a public cloud provider, but just hasn't lived up to it. The company typically positions itself as an innovator, but it's hard to do that when Amazon is already innovating quickly, and the company's product catalog isn't as large as that of its competitors.\n\"I've never felt that Google has put the level of effort necessary into this market to be a winner,\" she said in an interview. \nWhat's more, Google hasn't put as much effort as its competitors into building out an enterprise sales and support force, which is compounded by the fact that the ecosystem of partners built up around Google Cloud Platform isn't as robust as AWS's or Microsoft Azure's. \nDave Bartoletti, a principal analyst at Forrester, said in an email that the biggest challenge facing Google in the cloud wars is proving itself to enterprises. \n\"Cloud is already proven as the best place to quickly build exciting new web and mobile applications, but the next wave of cloud spending will be driven by large enterprises moving significant portions of their applications to the cloud,\" he said in an email. \"To reach these enterprise customers, Google needs marketing, sales, and channels designed to reach big companies, not consumers.\"\nThat change is already in progress. Google hired Diane Greene, the co-founder and ex-CEO of VMware, to take over its business-focused products, including the cloud platform, and she has been pushing to improve the company's standing with enterprises.\nJack Clark at Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the company is working on growing its enterprise sales channels, and that cloud chief Diane Greene took part in a recent customer meeting with partner SADA Systems. SADA's CEO reportedly said that was the first time a Google executive of her stature has done so in nine years. \nIf Google can better pitch its services to enterprises and build out additional products, it has tremendous potential behind it. Quizlet, a San Francisco-based education startup, moved all of its infrastructure over to GCP.\nThe company's pricing schemes (which avoid long-term contracts in favor of discounts for continued use) played a role in Quizlet's decision to move from Joyent, but Quizlet Platform Lead Peter Bakkum said that the ultimate decision came down to a belief that Google's core technology is better than that of the competition.\nBakkum's confidence is a key sign of what could be in Google's future. Urs Hölzle, its senior vice president for technical infrastructure, expects the company's public cloud business to overtake the advertising revenue that makes up the overwhelming majority of the money Google makes. \nWhat remains to be seen is if the company can live up to that prediction. \nRELATED TOPICS\n", "deleted" : false }

Factors like intense competition, rapid advances in technology, and frequent changes in consumer preferences pose significant challenges for this market as they negatively impact the revenue generating capacity of the vendors. In this market, the vendors compete on the basis of benefits and pricing to gain a competitive edge over their rivals.\nThe increasing number of sporting events is a major trend witnessed in the market. Sporting events such as the Olympics, FIFA, Super Bowl, and Cricket World Cup are gaining high traction and are watched by millions of the population across the world. The growing passion for such sports is attracting higher numbers of people to witness the event at the venue, which is increasing the number of tickets being sold each year, resulting in high growth in the global secondary tickets market.\nAccording to the report, high returns for low investment is a key driver in the market. The secondary market consists of several providers selling event tickets at various price ranges. Secondary ticket providers buy the event tickets in bulk, when their cost is low. As the date of the event approaches and the demand increases, resellers start selling the tickets at an increased price, which increases their revenue.\nFurther, the report states that the availability of live broadcasts on television is a major challenge witnessed in the market as these eliminate the need for a viewer to watch the show at the event venue.\nKey questions answered in the report:\nWhat will the market size and the growth rate be in 2020?\nWhat are the key factors driving the global secondary tickets market?\nWhat are the Key Market trends?impacting the growth of the global secondary tickets market?\nWhat are the challenges to market growth?\nWho are the key vendors in the global secondary tickets market?\nWhat are the market opportunities and threats faced by the vendors in the global secondary tickets market?\nTrending factors influencing the market shares of the EMEA, Americas, and APAC?\nWhat are the key outcomes of the five forces analysis of the global secondary tickets market?\nKey vendors are:\n", "deleted" : false }

I was fortunate to stumble on this ABC’s of Programmatic Advertising whitepaper from Marin Software, a leading demand-side advertising platform deeply rooted in the programmatic space. It was a pretty eye-opening read on how far online advertising has evolved over the recent years, and I wanted to share my learnings with all of you.\nWhat is Programmatic Advertising?\nProgrammatic advertising is exactly what is sounds like. It is automated buying and selling of digital advertising through centralized computer-driven ad exchanges and related databases and management platforms. It is designed to largely replace the old-school human powered aspects to buying and selling advertising through agencies and ad networks, with the goal of driving more efficiency and transparency to both advertisers and publishers. The advertisements can run the full gamut, including digital display, video, mobile, social or other ad creatives and placements. According to Business Insider, in the last several years, programmatic advertising has quickly grown to a $15BN industry today. This represents over 53% of all digital advertising in 2015, and is forecasted to grow to 65% by 2020. So, you bettter learn this stuff, as it is taking over, and fast!\nWho are the Key Players in the Programmatic Ecosystem?\nI thought the above graphic did a really nice job of laying out all the pieces of the programmatic advertising puzzle. At the center of the ecosystem are the ad exchanges (like DoubleClick, App Nexus, Rubicon, PubMatic, OpenX, Mopub, Smaato and AdTech). These are platforms where advertisers can set up ad campaigns to buy impressions and publishers can offer up inventory to be sold. This computer-driven system replaces the need for human driven ad networks or sales teams.\nWrapping around the ad exchanges are three key players: (i) the data management platforms, or DMPs (like Adobe, X Plus One, Blue Kai, Aggregate Knowledge Knotice, Core Audience and nPario), who collect and store all the internet user data in one central database; (ii) the Demand Side Platforms, or DSPs (like DoubleClick, MediaMath, DataXu, Rocketfuel, App Nexus and Marin Software), who enable marketers to bid on and buy ads from ad exchanges, including all campaign analytics; and (iii) the Supply Side Platforms, or SSPs (like OpenX, PubMatic, Rubicon Project, App Nexus, and Right Media), who enable publishers to offer inventry for sale through the ad exchanges, including all revenue analytics. In addition, the huge sites like Google, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft and Facebook have set up their own programmatic ecosystems, as well.\nWhy Does Programmatic Matter?\nWell, to advertisers, it is typically are far more cost-effective, quick and easy way to plan and place media buys. Why use humans to research and negotiate with the sales teams of hundreds of publishers, to pay expensive, high rate ad placements. Programmatic buys typically end up at a fraction of the cost (details below), and all with an unbelievable level of consumer targeting capabilities that were historically unavailable (also detailed below).\nAs for why the publishers should care: they may no longer need expensive human sales teams selling out their ad inventory. But, more importantly, given how far lower the CPM ad sales rates are in the programmatic vs. human world, they need to pay particular attention to how far their overall ad revenues may fall by launching programmatic solutions. My guess is, at some point, they won’t have a choice, and all publishers will need to be in programmatic, in one way or another.\nWhere Does the Consumer Data Come From?\nThere are three major types of consumer data sources, used in targeting ads to consumers. First party customer data is the cleanest, directly captured by consumers (e.g., their name, address, demographics), from that specific publisher. Second party data is similar to first party data, in that the data was directly captured from consumers, but is being sold by a third party that did not actually capture the direct data themselves. The benefit of second party data is the greater reach than first-party data, as it can been aggregated from numerous sources. And, third party data is anonymized data, captured by companies that that were never involved in any original transaction or engagement with a customer, but can append certain data from third party sources or use sophisticated algorithms to determine key classifiers (e.g., demographics, interests, affinities, behaviors, intent to purchase).\nHow Does the Targeting Work?\nThere are so many different ways to target your advertising to very specific customer groups. You can target based on audience (e.g, demographics), behaviors (e.g., actions taken), context (e.g., subject matter of content they are reading), intent (e.g., keyword searches or products viewed), location (e.g., based on GPS on their phones) and beacons (e.g., in-the-aisle in stores). Targeting can also be set to identify “look-alikes” to known users, to help increase the reach of your efforts (e.g., if my customers like sports, target other sports fans). Targeting can also be specifically set to hit one consumer across each of their multiple devices, to hit them with multiple impressions on each of their computers, phones, tablets, televisions, etc. when such specific device information is known. Key point, anything that can help signal customer intent, typically helps increase conversions and ROIs around those products.\nHow Does Retargeting Work?\nIn addition to finding new customers, you can also remarket to past customers or users, to pull them back with additional ad impressions served to them while they are on other websites within the network of publishers in the ad exchanges. You can remarket to them based on one of the following triggers: (i) if they visited your web site; (ii) viewed certain product or content pages on the web; (iii) if they opened or clicked your email; (iv) based on your CRM data; and (v) based on keyword searches in the search engines.\nHow Is the Ad Inventory Sold?\nAd inventory can either be sold on a reserved basis (guaranteed to run) or an unreserved basis (if the excess inventory is there to fulfill your request). And, the pricing can either be fixed (set rates, impressions, budgets) or auction-based (the price will be set at that of the highest bidder). The real-time bidding model is commonly referred to as RTB in the industry. According to Marin, only 8% of programmatic was reserved inventory/fixed price buys in 2014. But, that is forecasted to grow to 42% in 2016.\nHow Much Does it Cost?\nAds are sold either on a CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions), CPC (cost per click), CPA (cost per action) or CTC (click through conversion) basis. But, assume most programmatic is typically sold on a CPM basis. CPMs can range wildly based on the quality of the list and the level of targeting. The higher quality the list or the more specific you want to target, the higher the price. Prices also vary by industry, by devic, by format and by placement on the page. But, on average, assume CPMs in the $0.50 to $2 CPM range via programmatic. Which is material savings vs. the $10 or higher CPMs that are typically in the human-driven, non-programmatic world. So, programmatic can help you stretch your limited ad budgets 10-20x farther. Which is music to the ears of most small businesses with limited marketing budgets.\nI hope this crash course helped you get a better understanding of the programmatic advertising ecosystem and the wide world of options you have to explore there. Good luck!\n \n", "deleted" : false }

Get the latest in martech by subscribing to MarTech Today.\nSUBSCRIBE\nMarTech Landscape: What Is An Ad Network?\nAd networks have been around for nearly two decades. Find out how they work and what they offer publishers and advertisers.\nGinny Marvin on December 30, 2015 at 9:00 am\nMore\nAd networks make it possible for advertisers to buy digital ads across a slew of publisher sites and apps. How they came to be and how they work is the focus of this installment of our  MarTech Landscape Series .\nA Brief History\nFirst, a walk down memory lane. Ad networks sprouted up during the dotcom boom that started in the mid ‘90s. As the number of sites and digital publishers proliferated, they needed a simple way to increase inventory demand and ad revenues. Likewise, advertisers needed help scaling their digital ad buys across a growing number of websites without having to deal with each publisher directly.\nIn the beginning, there was DoubleClick. Launched in 1996, the digital ad services agency pioneered the concept of an ad network and attracted buyer demand with its ad performance tracking and reporting solutions. The company acted as a middleman, brokering ad buys between advertisers and a network of publishers.\nDoubleClick survived the dotcom bust of 2000, and Google bought it in 2007 for $3.1 billion. By that time, Google AdSense was four years old, having launched in 2003 . Today, the Google Display Network of Google AdSense publishers is the world’s biggest ad network, and DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) acts as Google’s premium network of publishers.\nWith the growth of mobile and video, ad networks that cater specifically to these areas formed, and many have been scooped up by the likes of Google (AdMob), Yahoo (Flurry and BrightRoll), Twitter (MoPub), AOL (Millenial Media, Adap.tv) and Facebook (LiveRail). TubeMogul and Tremor Video are examples of independent video ad networks. Chartboost, InMobi, Smaato, StartApp and TapJoy are among the still-independent mobile ad networks.\nHow Do Ad Networks Work?\nAt the most basic level, ad networks pool inventory of unsold ads from publishers and sell it to advertisers. They earn money by taking a cut of ad revenue, sometimes marking-up inventory before selling it.\nAds are delivered to a publisher’s site by an ad network’s ad server via code on the publisher’s site that calls the ad. Performance is tracked via a tracking pixel from the ad network that the advertiser places on the conversion page(s) such as a thank you page on its site . The ad network’s ad server powers ad targeting, tracking and reporting on the campaign.\nUnlike AdSense where advertisers and agencies manage bidding, targeting and optimization themselves, many ad networks manage campaigns on behalf of agencies and advertisers. In these cases, an ad network and buyer negotiate the terms of an ad buy such as audience targets, impressions (the number of times an ad is served) and average cost per impression (CPM). The ad network then executes the targeting, optimization and reporting on the campaign.\nWhat Types Of Targeting Are Available?\nSome ad networks categorize the sites in their network by the types of content they cover. Automotive, travel, beauty, fitness sites, for example, may be grouped into vertical channels and sold to advertisers that want to reach audiences interested in those topics. Some networks cater to specific verticals while others are open to nearly any type of site. Or ad networks may instead sell audience segments built on behavioral, interest, demographic and other data from publishers and third-party data providers.\nThere are also ad networks focused on low-priced inventory that give little to no transparency into where an advertisers’ ads show up. These blind buys can offer scale on the cheap, and are typically bought by direct response advertisers who measure performance by CPA and are less concerned about brand safety.\nAre All Ad Networks Equal?\nIn short, no. Some networks are very selective about the type and quality of publishers allowed in the network, while others are decidedly less so.\nMore restrictive ad networks may have exclusive access to premium publisher inventory. In fact, groups of publishers have formed their own ad networks to control the types of inventory in the pool and maintain premium pricing.\nSome networks will buy ad impressions in bulk from ad exchanges and re-sell them with a mark-up. Some ad networks also sell inventory from publishers on open exchanges. Another strategy is to syndicate ads sold through other ad networks.\nTransparency Concerns\nAd exchange buys and ad syndication are two reasons why buyers soured on some ad networks since it’s often unclear at the outset where a brand’s ads will run on (or off) the network.\nPricing transparency has been another concern. For example, an ad buy sold on an average CPM could end up showing on a large number of low-demand, low-CPM impressions, offset by a small number of premium, high CPM impressions. The ad network hits the CPM target with a big profit margin while the advertiser’s “premium” buy turns out to be anything but.\nBuyers also need to trust the networks’ targeting technologies will properly match their ads to relevant content and audiences for contextual and behavioral targeting campaigns. That hasn’t always panned out.\nFraud has also been an ongoing problem, costing advertisers billions, according to a 2014 study  by the Association of National Advertisers. There are many  variations of ad fraud . In some cases botnets, which can infect thousands of users’ computers with malware, generate bogus ad impressions and clicks that appear to be generated by humans. Another tactic of scammers is to infect ad networks with publisher sites or simple pages that are crammed with ad units.\nEven when fraud is not involved, studies have shown fewer than half of the digital ads shown are actually seen by users because they are served below the area in view on a user’s screen. In reaction to these issues, advertisers have pushed to have ads measured and sold on a viewable impression rather than served impression basis.  The industry has agreed on a standard for viewability for display (at least half the ad needs to be in view for at least one second) and video (fifty percent of the ad needs to be in view for at least 2 seconds), Many ad networks and publishers now offer viewable impression pricing and verification.\nPricing And Ad Formats\nAd networks started in the age of the desktop banner, but they now encompass all kinds of digital inventory, including mobile and video.\nThere are ad networks that specialize in one type of ad format or medium and others that sell just about anything. In addition to standard IAB ad units, some examples of other ad formats sold by ad networks are native display and video ads, in-image ads, content recommendations and in-text ads.\nMany networks offer several pricing options. Pricing models include cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM), viewable CPM (vCPM), cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-acquisition (CPA), cost-per-view for video (CPV). Some buys are fixed-rate, while others are auction-based (like AdSense).\nPublishers typically earn a percentage of ad revenues.\nYou might be wondering how ad networks are different than ad exchanges. Stay tuned. Ad exchanges will be the focus of the next installment of the MarTech Landscape series.\nAbout The Author\n", "deleted" : false }

Tim Carmody Business\nDate of Publication: 12.02.11.\nTime of Publication: 2:14 pm.\n2:14 pm\nGoogle Prime: Retail Competiton With Amazon Is Still About Data\nGoogle is known for tirelessly shaving milliseconds off delivering search results. Could the company use big data to do the same to deliver retail goods fast?\nSources speaking to the Wall Street Journal and New York Times say that Google, troubled by Amazon’s dominance in product search with Prime’s speedy shipping, is looking to partner with other brick-and-mortar retailers close to customers to offer the same one-two day delivery.\nPotential partners include Macy’s, The Gap, and OfficeMax, although a Macy’s spokesman says they’ve made no decisions about participation, according to the Journal. If it comes to fruition, the service would launch sometime in 2012, starting with pilot programs in San Francisco and New York.\nInstead of rebuilding Amazon’s national storage and shipping infrastructure, Google appears to be pursuing a federated, software-service-side model. It would handle online search and payments on the customer side and use its data centers to match search requests with nearby stores, fulfillment centers and delivery services — particularly those who can provide fast, free shipping.\nWhy would Google want to play a bigger part in retail? The same reason it wants a part of identity services, offers and local search: customers seeking out products is increasingly playing a bigger and part of Google’s core business in search and advertising.\nAlthough Google’s long offered what it calls “Product Search,” customers have grown accustomed to turning to bypassing its portals and searching directly with retail specialists like Amazon or eBay.\nGoogle wants those search hits, and the premium advertising space it can offer to customers already looking to buy something.\nContinue reading ‘ Google Prime: Retail Competiton With Amazon Is All About Data ‘ …\n“Google getting in the [physical] fulfillment is DOA,” Forrester Analyst Sucharita Mulpuru said, noting the huge expense of trying to compete with Amazon in this space from scratch. “They want to play in local and help drive more online sales, which would drive more search revenue.”\nBesides helping drive search, inserting itself into the retail chain offers a company with Google’s algorithmic firepower plenty of other revenue opportunities, by aggregating, analyzing and optimizing data on customer-retailer interaction.\n“I expect the company will focus on becoming an arbiter of shopping intent and transactions,” Mercent Corporation CEO Eric Best told Internet Retailer . (Best is in a position to know: Mercent provides marketing expertise to smaller retailers through Google, Amazon, eBay and other portals.)\nCapturing data exhaust in online retail doesn’t just play to Google’s strengths; it could give the company a tool that Amazon may have difficulty matching.\nStill, it won’t be easy. Google’s already run afoul of the Federal Trade Commission due to antitrust concerns. If Google actively engages in a substantial business relationship with retailers, it could easily be accused of tipping the scales to steer search traffic their way.\nTo a certain extent, that would be the whole point of partnering with Google. But retailers who don’t participate in the program would have good reason to cry foul.\nAnother hurdle is plausibly delivering on two-day delivery — especially when Amazon and other companies have trained customers to expect (and seek out) free shipping.\nMulpuru is skeptical. “So much of local or same day fulfillment has nothing to do with figuring out the last mile,” she said. Mulpuru also noted that while Google has a log history of encouraging independent teams to explore new projects, recently CEO and co-founder Larry Page has been ruthless in streamlining Google’s offerings and focusing its teams on the company’s core businesses.\nEven if Google may be dipping its toes in the water, “Page may kill it before it sees the light of day,” Mulpuru said.\nIf that’s the case, both small e-retailers and Amazon-sized giants can breathe a lot easier.\n", "deleted" : false }

I have first hand knowledge of this industry and wrote about it a year ago .\nA lot of cash changes hands, making accounting difficult and tax evasion a competitive necessity for ticket brokers that want to stay ahead. A common practice among brokers is to sell a ticket to a consumer first and then go and find the ticket afterwards. If the broker misjudged the pricing – which is common – they often back out of the transaction. And since many states regulate or outright prohibit the secondary sale of tickets, the whole market tends to be a grey area, leading to further erosion of consumer confidence and even higher prices. Adding to the confusion – counterfeit tickets are still very common.\nThat never stopped eBay from diving into the business head first (while avoiding relatively tame markets like virtual goods ). And they doubled-down last January with their $310 million acquisition of secondary ticket marketplace Stubhub.\nBut a new class of startups is emerging that is starting to securitize the ticket industry in ways that work very similar to the stock market. One startup, Yoonew , is pushing the envelope more than most.\nFor now Yoonew is focusing on football tickets, and the Super Bowl is their big event. People pay $2,000 or more (lots more) for Super Bowl tickets. If you want a good seat, and buy from a reputable broker (this is a relative term), you are quite simply going to be paying a staggering amount of money. If you wait to the last minute you might get a deal, particularly if the teams aren’t a draw. But you also run the risk of paying a lot more, or not getting in at all.\nBehind the scenes are the market makers – the very select few individuals who actually have their hands on the tickets. These include players and NFL officials, official partners to the NFL, and the people who purchase tickets from them. How much they pay for those tickets is based on their analysis of the game economics, and they are putting serious capital at risk every year. They then turn around and sell those tickets to the public. If they’re good they make a lot of money. If not, they can lose their business over a single game.\nYoonew is productizing that risk and bringing it down to the level of the individual ticket buyer – people who actually want to attend the game. Instead of buying a ticket early and not knowing if your team will even make it, people can simply buy a contract that delivers a ticket at no additional charge if their team makes it. If the team doesn’t make it, they’re out whatever they paid for the contract.\nPrices are market based – and contracts can be purchased for as little as a few hundred dollars (prices are rising steadily now as the chances of any particular remaining team making it go up dramatically). That’s a big lure for rabid fans who can’t otherwise afford to attend the game. They pay now, and hope for the best.\nYoonew says they guarantee their contracts, and have never had an incident of fraud or non delivery. But I can’t find a link anywhere on the site to exactly what that guarantee is. An article in Forbes suggest it’s three times the price paid, but I don’t see evidence for that on the site. Even 3x your money won’t make up for the losses if your team makes it and you don’t get a ticket. So, as they say, Caveat Emptor.\nThere’s a good overall history of the company and founders here .

Some of the minor patents issued today covered Time Machine, which may come in handy in Apple's current patent infringement case, and a design patent which relates to Apple's Mail app. Yet the notables within today's group of granted patents include strategically important iPhone/Multi-Touch patents which will definitely add to Apple's smartphone war chest.   \n \nGranted Design Patents: Mail Icon, Bluetooth Headset +\n \nApple has been granted three design patents this morning. The first design win relates to Apple Mail. Specifically, the cool \"Airplane Send Icon\" is the focus of this patent which credits CEO Steve Jobs and Bas Ording as the inventors. The second design win is for their now defunct Bluetooth Headset which Apple may resurrect in a future product.\n \n \nApple describes their third design patent as \"a user interface for a computer display with a large, lower rectangle that conveys the impression of a translucent/transparent surface and a small, upper rectangle that does not convey the impression of a translucent/transparent surface.\"\n \nGranted Patent: Multi-Touch Input Discrimination\n \nApple's granted patent is about multi-touch. Specifically it's about intelligent input rejection and operational mode transitions. Apple's patent states that \"For a hand-held multi-touch touch-surface device that may be put into a pocket, purse, or held against the head (e.g., portable music player, portable video player, personal digital assistant or mobile phone), detecting when the device is being clasped on the way into or out of the pocket, against the body, or against the head is very useful for: input rejection (ensuring that touch-surface input signals generated as a result of these actions are not mistaken for normal finger/stylus touches); operational mode transitions (e.g., dimming the device's backlight, putting the device to sleep and waking the device from a low-power state); and, for mobile telephones, answering calls (e.g., when the device is brought near, but not necessarily touching the head) and/or terminating calls (e.g., when the unit is placed into a pocket or purse).\"\n \n \nApple's patent FIG. 1 shows, in flowchart form, a multi-touch processing methodology In patent FIG. 2 we see a flowchart form, a patch irregularity calculation; In patent FIG. 5 we see a plot of empirically determined data illustrating a patch irregularity measure's ability to discriminate between ear contacts and other touch-surface contacts (e.g., fingertips, thumbs and cheeks); and FIG. 7 shows us a block diagram form of a touch-surface device.\n \nApple's First Claim: A method to discriminate input sources to a touch-surface device, comprising: obtaining a proximity image; segmenting the proximity image to identify a plurality of patches; determining a minor axis radius value for each of the plurality of patches; identifying one of the plurality of patches as being associated with a large object if the minor axis radius value of the patch is above a first specified threshold; and using the identified patch to control an operation of a touch-surface device.\n \nApple credits Wayne Westerman as the sole inventor of Granted Patent 7,855,718 originally filed in Q1 2007.\n \nGranted Patent: User Interface for Positioning an Insertion Marker in a Touch Screen Display\n \nApple has been granted a patent that generally relates to user interfaces, and more particularly, to a method, system, and user interface for positioning an insertion marker in a touch-sensitive display.\n \nApple's patent FIG. 3 shown below illustrates a process flow (300) for positioning an insertion marker via an insertion marker placement aid. An insertion marker is displayed on a touch screen (302) in an application that includes text entry, such as a memo pad, email, or short message service (SMS) application. In some embodiments, the insertion marker is displayed in a first area (for example, display tray 214 of FIG.3) that also includes text entered by the user via a keyboard (for example, keyboard 210 of FIG.3) that is located in a second area. A contact on the touch screen, formed by a finger, is detected (304 and 404).\n \n \nApple credits Scott Forstall, Senior Vice President of iPhone Software and his team members Bas Ording, Marcel Van Os, Kenneth Kocienda, Richard Williamson; Bas (San Francisco, CA), Van Os; Marcel (San Francisco, CA), Kocienda; Kenneth (Sunnyvale, CA) and Williamson; Richard as the inventors of Granted Patent 7,856,605 originally filed in Q4 2006 or a little under three months prior to the iPhone's introduction.\n \nGranted Patent: Time Machine\n \nApple has been granted yet another patent for Time Machine and specifically for a \"User Interface for Backup Management.\" Last week Apple was granted two other Time Machine related patents \"Navigation of Electronic Backups\" and \"Conflict Resolution in Recovery of Electronic Data.\" It was noted in our October report that Apple is being sued for alleged patent infringement by Mirror Worlds. They claim that Spotlight, Time Machine and Cover Flow infringe their patents. Apple's latest string of related patents may come into play during their trial.\n \n \n \nApple's First Claim: A computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer readable storage medium, the computer program product including instructions that, when executed, generate on a display device a graphical user interface, the graphical user interface comprising: a view display area for presenting a current view, where the current view provides a representation of a window in a current state, where the window is distinct from the graphical user interface; a prior state display area for presenting a prior state of the current view including one or more representations of the window as it existed at times in the past, the prior state of the current view including one or more first representations of the window, where each first representation shows a past state of the window; and an input control for initiating a restoration of the window associated with the current view to a state associated with one of the first representations.\n \nApple credits Scott Forstall, Senior Vice President of iPhone Software and team members Pavel Cisler, Mike Matas, Gregory Christie, Mike Matas, Marcel Van Os, Kevin Tiene and Gene Ragan as the inventors of Granted Patent 7,856,424 originally filed in Q3 2006.\n \nOther Granted Patents Published Today\n \nOne : Scene Change Identification During Encoding of Compressed Video:  Apple's invention generally relates to scene change detection and bit rate control in video encoding, and more particularly, to scene change identification and bit rate control during the encoding of compressed video images;  Two : Another Video Related Patent: Apple's invention addresses methods for determining the number of unidirectional and bi-directional frames to be encoded for a video sequence and a method for detecting scene cuts in the video sequence;  Three : Mail Related: Apple's patent generally relates to message filtering. More particularly, this invention relates to email filtering using latent semantic analysis; and  Four : The original 2005 iPod Shuffle patent.\n \nIn Other Apple News\n \nApple Trademarks: Apple has filed for \"Express Lane\" and \"VoicePass\" in China. Both trademarks relate to Apple Support . Both trademarks were filed under International Classifications 37 and 42. The trademarks were originally filed in Trinidad and Tobago in mid 2010. Apple Abandons POD: In the Canadian Trademark Database we see that Apple Abandoned their efforts to trademark the word \"POD\" on December 08, 2010.\n \nApple Sued: Great Northern Insurance Co. vs. Apple Inc: The legal complaint filed against Apple states that a MagSafe adapter ignited combustible materials within the residence of Eric and Penelope Marziali, causing a fire. After a detailed investigation of the cause of the fire, the fire marshal for the Town of Glastonbury, Connecticut, concluded that the origin of the accidental fire appeared to be associated with the external system components of the laptop (MacBook Pro). Great Northern Insurance Company paid out $75,000 to the Marziali's and is seeking to recover these costs from Apple. The case came to light in documents found in December, though the original filing with the Connecticut District Court was made on November 19, 2010 (Case 3:2010cv01826).\n \nThere have been other patent infringement lawsuits filed against Apple in the last 30 days. There were two filed by Affinity Labs of Texas, which are tied into a legal case that began in Q1 2010. Another was filed yesterday by Multimedia Patent Trust. It's a complicated suit with a lot of baggage. Yet for our legally minded fans that might be interested in reading up on this case, we'll point you to  Foss Patents  - who present a long but thorough breakdown of this new lawsuit.  \n \nNotice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of patents with associated graphic(s) for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application and/or Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application and/or Issued Patent should be read in its entirety for further details.

Visible Measures’ new breakthrough approach empowers advertisers, content publishers and site owners with real-time metrics and optimization to radically enhance the effectiveness of Internet-delivered video advertising campaigns, helping all parties build better content and monetization models.  In a separate press release today (Editor’s note: see release entitled, Visible Measures to Provide Brightcove Publishers with Online Video Audience Engagement Metrics), Visible Measures announced a key partnership and industry endorsement for its Video Experience Measurement solutions.\nOnline video usage is proliferating rapidly and the medium offers new possibilities for precise targeted marketing. In fact, market researcher eMarketer recently reported that Internet video advertising spending will nearly triple in 2007 to $640 million in the United States alone, up from $225 million in 2006. eMarketer further projects that this number will jump to at least $1.5 billion by 2010.\nHowever, advertisers and publishers are struggling to properly understand audience engagement. Video consumption on the Web varies greatly from that of television, and demands a new set of metrics to help predict and analyze the success of online video content and advertisements. Visible Measures bridges that gap with its industry-defining method for Video Experience Measurement that applies deep and real-time optimization capabilities to help companies efficiently improve and monetize the video customer experience.\nThe traditional method of television audience measurement simply does not work for online video,said Jeff Pulver, chairman and founder of pulver.com and founder of Network2.tv. Broadcasters and advertisers currently use sampling to determine television viewership, which makes sense as there are relatively few channels and standard programming patterns, so the assumptions are often good enough. However, the Internet has created millions of microchannels and one-off videos that can be watched anytime, so content producers and advertisers need a next-generation analytics solution to help them make sense of it all and measure the success of each video.\nGeneral Catalyst Partners Provides Series A Funding and Joins Board\nVisible Measures also announced $5.0 million in Series A funding from General Catalyst Partners . The funding will be used to support the company’s growth and to expand product development efforts. Concurrent with the Series A financing, Larry Bohn and Neil Sequeira, both of General Catalyst Partners, have joined Visible Measures’ board of directors.\nGeneral Catalyst sees great potential for Visible Measures because it is serving a very immediate need in the growing online video market,’ said Bohn.\nVisible Measures was founded by startup veteran Brian Shin to help Internet video publishers improve audience engagement and increase video advertising effectiveness. Shin will be speaking at Spring VON in a presentation entitled, “Video Metrics & Measurement”, which takes place on Thursday, March 22 at 1:45 p.m.\n“With audiences increasingly consuming online rich-media content, publishers and advertisers require a new analytical framework to determine how to efficiently and effectively reach their customers, “said Shin. “Our goal is to become the universally-trusted, independent audience measurement standard that unifies advertisers and publishers. Only with common, insightful metrics will they improve the viewer experience and better monetize their content.”\nAbout Visible Measures\nVisible Measures Corp. (VMC) offers a breakthrough method for Internet video audience measurement. The company’s patent-pending Video Experience Measurement solutions provide independent third party metrics of video viewership to help publishers and advertisers deliver superior customer engagement and increased advertising effectiveness.

Has the fact that Facebook now delivers 4 billion views a day convinced advertisers that the site is a potentially viable alternative to TV?\nNo, not yet, according to advertisers. Though they do acknowledge that Facebook’s video business can’t be ignored.\nMajor ad buyers say that Facebook’s video view numbers are undoubtedly impressive. But in terms of actual ad inventory, Facebook still pales in comparison to YouTube, which features pre-roll ads (something Facebook has shied away from) and has a more developed video ad business.\n“The growth of video views on Facebook is staggering,” said Adam Shlachter, chief investment officer at Digitas. “But it’s still not 100% clear what the opportunities are to capitalize on that.”\nTo that end, Facebook held its non-Newfront, NewFront-like presentation for advertisers last night in New York , during which is shared details on Anthology , the company’s branded video content initiative. The affair, held at Facebook’s New York office, included presentations from companies such as Vice, Tastemade and Funny or Die.\nThe Anthology gathering was timed just a few days before the kickoff of the NewFronts, which are anchored by YouTube and its usually splashy event, and a few weeks before the major broadcast networks present their schedules for the coming season. All are competing for major advertisers’ marketing budgets.\nWhile Facebook got in front of advertisers first, it hasn’t necessarily taken the wind out of YouTube’s sails–or sales. “I don’t think what [Facebook is] doing throws a wrench in anything YouTube is doing,” said John Swift, Omnicom Media Group ’s chief executive of North American investment.\nTo be sure, YouTube’s ad strategy is far from perfect (as WSJ reported recently , the site has struggled to reach profitability). But the Google -owned video behemoth has made great strides over the past few years catering to advertisers’ demands for more TV-like data and buying options , while also making a concerted effort to market its biggest stars .\nAnd there’s no question that video ads posted on Facebook–like the “Star Wars” movie trailer–can take off like wildfire. Of course, those instances don’t always consist of solely paid media efforts.\nLet's catch that teaser trailer again! Marvel's \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" in theaters May 1, 2015.\nPosted by Avengers on Thursday, October 23, 2014\nFor example, Visible Measures looked at 82 Web video campaigns released in March that in aggregate reached 437.5 million people through a combination of paid advertising or organic, people-driven sharing. More than half of those campaigns used Facebook.\nAmong all the campaigns released in March, Facebook accounted for 35% of total viewership, versus 65% for YouTube. At the end of last year, Facebook’s share was in the single digits, found Visible Measures.\n“There is a huge opportunity for Facebook to grab video ad dollars because of its targeting,” said Brian Shin, Visible Measures’ chief executive. “But we don’t see those dollars coming from YouTube.”\nYet Facebook doesn’t seem to be in a huge rush to fully monetize its 4 billion daily video streams. Executives declined to provide much in the way of detail about the company’s long-term plans for its video ad business during yesterday’s earnings call .\nIn the near term, the Anthology-branded partnership deals provide a way for the company to learn what its users like in terms of video alongside content creators and marketers.\nOne interesting note from last night’s gathering, according to several executives in attendance, is that Facebook and its Anthology partners spoke about using the social network’s rich data set to inform what sort of programming gets developed through these deals.\n“Facebook’s focus on real identity allows for rich creative development [and] personalization at scale,” stated Steven Kydd, co-founder of Tastemade.\nShare this:\n", "deleted" : false }

The service then extracts the data to create a centralized tracking point for all deliveries. TrackMyShipments regularly pings the original service for updates, and can email or SMS location updates of tracked items to users.\nThe Milpitas based service is a solid enough idea, although I can’t help that wonder exactly how many people have soo many packages on the way that they need a centralized management service for them.

Then it can make the ads dynamic, or change them based on what a player has seen before.\nThis is the first time ever that Miniclip has been able to monetize content inside of its games in a scalable and real-time fashion since its 2001 founding. RapidFire gives advertisers a new and engaging way to reach consumers on Miniclip’s huge online gaming site for kids and casual gamers. Miniclip has 100 million monthly active players and 900 games for this new revenue stream.\n“We’re thrilled to work with a strong partner like Miniclip, who has the ability to bring multiple game titles and millions of new players into our network,” says Jordan L.

Historically, this has only seen use in console and high-definition PC games. The reason for this is because web-based games have lacked the 3D graphics environments that enable billboards and other 3D ads to be fully visible to players.\nThe Vancouver, Canada-based RapidFire recently acquired the console-based in-game ad technology from IGA Worldwide.\n“Miniclip is always looking for innovative advertising technologies that fit with our games. We have high demands when it comes to our various monetization models. In-game advertising is a solution that we think has great potential to become even more important over the next years,” says Sylvia Epaillard, the senior advertising manager at Miniclip.\nMiniclip is including the Radial Network in games such as Motocross Nitro, Turbo Racing 3, Diablo Valley Rally, Pro Kicker Frenzy, and Basketball Jam Shots. In the coming weeks, additional Miniclip games will use RapidFire.\nRapidFire was founded in 2012 as an in-game advertising agency, mostly doing product placement in video games. It switched 11 months ago to operate as an in-game ad network, similar to the older companies like Massive (which Microsoft acquired) and IGA Worldwide. RapidFire has 15 employees, and it has been bootstrapped without outside funding. The company has run more than 250 campaigns this past year for brands like Disney, Red Bull, Paramount Pictures, McDonald’s, and Hankook Tire.\n“Miniclip is always looking for innovative advertising technologies that fit with our games.

The deal furthers Walmart Labs' mobile push and marks its 13th acquisition in the past three years.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\nIn a blog post announcing the acquisition, Gibu Thomas, SVP of mobile and digital at Walmart, said the Labs team was impressed by how quickly Stylr founders Eytan Daniyalzade and Berk Atikoglu were able to develop and grow the app.\nThomas stressed the focus Walmart Labs has placed on mobile app development, given the estimation that 80 percent of Walmart customers under the age of 35 own a smartphone, and half have used their device in-store to assist with their shopping.\nThomas wrote in the blog:\nWe are excited about the opportunity to serve these customers with indispensable digital tools that bring the convenience of online shopping into our physical stores and integrate our online and offline experiences to enable our customers to shop anytime, anywhere.\nWhat's key that statement is the mention of integration and the need to bridge offline and online shopping experiences. Walmart joins the bevy of other retailers that are all on that mission and likely fighting the same enemy — Amazon.\nWith a rumored smartphone announcement coming Wednesday, Amazon is upping the ante on technology's ability to reach shoppers and make them spend money. An Amazon smartphone would give the gargantuan online retailer a direct link to consumers, prompting the rest of the retail pack (Walmart in particular) to beef up their own mobile muscle.\nWalmart is obviously aware of the challenge. It's been buying a range of companies with diverse technologies and integrating them into Labs' products. Last month it acquired Adchemy, a product search and e-commerce firm. Before that there was Yumprint, a recipe and meal-planning service, and before that it bought Torbit, makers of Web acceleration technology. They joined Small Society, Set Direction, Grabble and OneRiot, companies focused on building the retailer's mobile app strategy, as well as Inkiru, OneOps and Tasty Labs.\nThe acquisitions brought Walmart Labs' employee count to more than 2,000, and it will gain two more from Stylr. Both Daniyalzade and Atikoglu will join Walmart Labs in San Bruno, California.\nRead more: \n", "deleted" : false }

Eliot Van Buskirk Business\nDate of Publication: 03.04.11.\nTime of Publication: 4:01 pm.\n4:01 pm\nSurprise! Qtrax, The ‘Free and Legal Music Downloads’ Service, Is Back\nQtrax's free music downloads are wrapped in Microsoft WMA DRM, as shown here by the \"Yes\" in the Protected field.\nSurprise, surprise: Qtrax is back. Starting today you can download the free on-demand music service, which made big waves in 2008 with its failed attempt to launch a free music service with music from all four major labels.\nA new Microsoft Silverlight version of Qtrax , available at a hidden URL that’s currently making the rounds, lets music fans download as much free music as they can handle from a large catalog of music from three of the four major labels — EMI, Sony Music, and Universal Music Group. All you have to do in return is view a few ads within the Windows desktop app.\nQtrax spokeswoman Shamin Abas told Evolver.fm that those three major labels have each inked deals with Qtrax to allow their music to be downloaded by Qtrax users for free. We have contacted EMI, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music to confirm that they had signed deals with Qtrax, but our testing backs up what Abas told us: that hundreds of thousands of major label tracks have already been uploaded into the system, and Qtrax is currently uploading millions more in preparation for its official launch next week.\n(Update: EMI spokesman Dylan Jones confirmed the deal to Evolver.fm, stating, “EMI Music recently completed a short term agreement with QTrax to enable them to distribute a selection of EMI content as ad-supported streams and conditional downloads.”)\nThis means that so long as you don’t mind playing your downloaded music within the Qtrax app, there’s a massive amount of music there, all free for the downloading. The app saves music as DRM-ed WMA files, which are playable within Qtrax but not in other applications — not even in Microsoft’s own Windows Media Player. They also won’t play on any portable devices and, crucially, cannot be successfully shared on file-sharing networks.\nEven without the threat of P2P, Qtrax faces challenges. Ad-supported music has been a notoriously tough nut to crack, as services like the Warner Music Group-funded imeem demonstrated all too clearly . Qtrax, too, had its share of travails back in ‘08, when it failed to secure music distribution licenses. It remains to be seen whether the company can sell enough ads to support free music downloads — and in this beta version at least, Qtrax’s ads aren’t too obtrusive.\nAfter testing this new version of Qtrax, we can confirm that it really works, offering a large catalog with music from EMI, Sony Music and Universal Music Group for free download, but not music from the notoriously ad-supported-music-shy Warner Music Group. We didn’t encounter any glitches with playback, browsing, or other commonly-accessed features.\nEach band page, regardless of whether Qtrax has free downloads for it, includes links out to YouTube videos, Ticketmaster ticket searches, Amazon purchase links, and a Wikipedia link, in addition to photos and bios within the Qtrax app itself.\nAccording to Abas, talks with Warner are “going well,” but the deals with EMI, Sony and Universal are global in nature, and the above link is already live in 30 countries. Qtrax’s “Free and Legal Music Downloads” service is scheduled to go live on Qtrax.com next week.\nSee Also:\n", "deleted" : false }

When you put on the Apple Watch you enter in your security pin, then as long as the Apple Watch knows it is still in contact with the wrist, you don't have to enter in the pin again.\nThis feature makes using the Apple Watch to pay for things via Apple Pay more convenient, but it's also open to exploits.\nBait and switch\nWhen the sensor detects that the wrist is no longer in contact with the Apple Watch, the wearable locks itself, requiring you to enter in a pin next time you wear it. If someone removes it from your wrist and puts it on themselves, they will need to enter in that pin.\nHowever it was discovered that there are two weaknesses to Apple's implementation; the first is that the sensor takes about a second to detect that it's not being touched by the wrist. While this means that it doesn't accidentally lock itself when the Apple Watch moves when being worn, it does provide thieves with a window – no matter how slight.\nThe other weakness is that the sensor cannot differentiate between a wrist and a finger, so someone could steal the Apple Watch and then place a finger over the sensor to keep it from being locked.\nThe thief could then use your Apple Watch to pay for things without having to enter in any pin. The blogger at WonderHowTo posted a video on how this flaw could be exploited.\nAs you can see from the video it is tricky to pull off, and will be very difficult to perform without the wearer noticing, but it is possible.\nWe also tried the method here and can confirm that it does work (don't worry, we returned the Apple Watch to its owner afterwards).\nAlthough you might be concerned that by posting a video on how to do this will simply teach thieves the trick, it should hopefully bring the issue to the attention of Apple, who could eliminate the risk by reducing the time the sensor takes to notice it's not attached to the wrist, or by replacing it with a more sophisticated device in the next model.\nUntil then, be extra weary and if your Apple Watch does get stolen make sure you cancel any cards connected to the device to be on the safe side.\n", "deleted" : false }

The study’s goal was to discover which cities in the U.S. had the fastest average download speeds, and not surprisingly, major tech hotspots like San Francisco, Austin, Seattle and New York all led the pack.\nBut topping the list? Not San Francisco. Instead, the honors go to Austin, which saw speeds of 841 KBps, Pando found.\nPando has good reason to track metrics like this, as it provides software to both consumers and businesses that enable downloads of large files. Game companies contract with Pando to have their games distributed using Pando’s software, which then measures the speed of the download as the data is delivered to end-users.\nThe client runs in the background on users’ computers, and while its use case biases the study a little bit towards a certain type of computer user, the large sample size still makes it possible to paint a decent picture of comparative speeds in the states and cities the study analyzed.\nAmong the largest cities in the U.S., (those with populations greater than 500,000), the fastest speeds were recorded primarily in tech hotspots, with Austin, as noted above, arriving in first place. Following that were San Francisco (828 KBps), Boston (827 KBps), Seattle (805 KBps), and New York (787 KBps).\nMeanwhile, El Paso, Texas had the slowest speed, at 483 KBps – or, about half that of Austin. Other pokey towns included Fort Worth (517 KBps), Oklahoma City (518 KBps), Albuquerque (537 KBps) and Denver (550 KBps).\nIn terms of regions, the densely populated Northeast and mid-Atlantic fared well, while more rural areas suffered. The fastest state was Rhode Island, with an average speed of 963 KBps, which topped Delaware’s 923 KBps and New Jersey’s 897 KBps.\nIdaho was the slowest state, averaging 387 KBps, followed by Oklahoma (443 KBps) and Montana (452 KBps). South Dakota, however, surprised with a speed of 712 KBps, topping both Florida and Illinois.\nThe study also rated ISPs, finding Comcast delivered the highest average download speeds (941 KBps), followed by Optimum Online at 874KBps,  Charter Communications at 868KBps, Cox at 800KBps, Verizon at 799KBps and Time Warner’s Road Runner at 737KBps.\nThe full list of top cities (those with populations over 500,000) is below.

And the only prescription is more games. That’s right. Sifting through some of Pando Networks’ recent numbers on international gaming, we found that Turkey owns an increasing share of the global downloads of free-to-play games. Over the last year, the number of gamers in Turkey downloading free games climbed to over 5 million, a 534 percent increase since 2010 — and more than 14 percent of the country’s total population.\nNot only that, but Turkey has a growing appetite for social games, which is precisely the reason Peak Games has parked its headquarters in Istanbul. In case you’re not familiar, Peak Games is a social gaming company that produces titles specifically for emerging markets — specifically in Turkey, the Middle East, North Africa, and South America.\nIn conversation with the gaming company’s Chief of Strategy, Rina Onur, she made it abundantly clear that the company is aware of the huge lead Zynga has built in social games in the U.S. (its titles have over 55 million daily active users, compared with Microsoft in second at 22 million), and that there is stiff competition among Zynga, EA, wooga, and others for the Western markets. But Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa (MENA) have increasingly connected populations, their young people are coming online in droves, and they love to play games.\nSo, while Zynga, EA, and wooga focus their efforts in Europe and North America, largely lacking a presence in MENA, Peak Games has been busy acquiring studios or creating their own games like Okey, Umaykut Online, Akvaryum, Erlikhan Günlük Falınız, which Onur says now have over 7 million daily active users. (Although AppData puts that closer to 4 million.) These games are all built around popular Turkish and Arabic card/board games that are native to the region, so the titles are tailored towards their specific local markets, in their native tongue.\nPeak Games’ MENA focus has caught the attention of top tier VCs in Europe, as the company closed a $11.5 million series B funding round in September from Earlybird Venture Capital and Hummingbird Ventures, among others, bringing the startup’s total investment to just under $20 million. At the time, Turkey was the fourth largest Facebook market, with some 30 million+ using the social network, and those numbers continue to grow across the Middle East and North Africa.\nWith this high rate of adoption, the startup has been eager to acquire studios with strong development talent and established titles and help bring those to the Facebook platform, make them more social, and expose them to its multi-million-strong existing user base. Last summer, it acquired two hardcore strategy game studios, Umaykut and Erlikhan, (both of which are Turkish) in an effort to continue bringing these emerging markets to social gaming.\nAnd today, Peak Games is announcing the acquisition of Saudi Arabian social games giant, Kammelna Games, as it looks to further expand its reach into underserved markets with localized, culturally-specific games. The startup already has a popular Arabic-language title with Happy Farm (at some 2.2 million daily active users), which it will now complement with Kammelna’s “Baloot,” a popular Saudi trick card game.\nOnur tells us that Kammelna founder Essam Alzamel will now run Peak Games’ new studio in Damman, Saudi Arabia, keeping the company’s 15-odd employees in their home country, and successfully adding another location to Peak Games’ already existing offices in Istanbul, Ankara, Amman, Barcelona and Berlin.\nThe Chief of Strategy says that more than two-thirds of Internet users in Saudi Arabia play games online, and the country has one of the highest average revenue per user (ARPU) rates in social gaming. Capitalizing on what they see as a massive regional opportunity (that is only going to get bigger), Peak will now set about launching Baloot across platforms, including Facebook and mobile, as well as using Kammelna to develop (and launch) more Arabic card, board, and table-top games.\nPeak Games now claims to have over 20 million active players worldwide, with 150 employees (40 of whom are in MENA), and you can be sure that this is not even close to the end of the startup’s near-term M&A strategy, as we hear that Peak is in the process of acquiring yet another studio. It’s not clear which studio yet (and the company would not divulge the price of its Kammelna acquisition), but you can be sure that the acquisition will be another stepping stone in its mission for MENA dominance. More to come as we learn more.\n", "deleted" : false }

Today that platform is actually launching.\nThe company bills One (or, to use the full name, One by AOL) as the platform where advertisers can optimize their ad campaigns across channels including video, display, and television. A big piece of that launch involves rebranding AOL’s existing programmatic ad products, so Adap.tv is now known as One by AOL: Video; the AdLearn Open Platform is now known as One by AOL: Display; and Convertro is now known as One by AOL: Attribution. (Like TechCrunch, Adap.tv and Convertro were both startups acquired by AOL.)\nNonetheless, Seth Demsey, the chief technology officer for AOL Platforms, said the past year has been spent writing new code, and he estimated that 50 percent of One represents new technology, both with features like multi-touch attribution (tracking how different ads on different screens can contribute to a purchase), and in “componentizing” the platform so that in the future, new products can be plugged in easily.\nAOL has become increasingly focused on programmatic advertising (where the ad-buying process is managed by technology and algorithms). In fact, the shift to programmatic was one of the reasons given for the company’s restructuring and layoffs earlier this year.\nDemsey highlighted a few key features that he said set One apart, including the simplification of bringing all ad channels and data sources into one interface; the single, unified view it provides for each consumer; its speed (he showed me how to create a new audience segment and launch a campaign targeting that segment within a couple of minutes); the fact that it can offer premium advertising at scale, thanks in part to personalization capabilities; and its openness.\nThat last point was probably the biggest one, with Demsey contrasting AOL’s approach with the “walled gardens” of Google and Facebook. (He previously worked at Google.) Of course, “open” is a buzzword that gets thrown around a lot — what really makes AOL more open? Demsey said the litmus test is “full fidelity of data, in and out” of the platform, meaning that advertisers should be able to take all their data from One to whatever platform or product they choose.\nEarly users of One include Intuit and ad agency Havas. Demsey noted that different customers will use One in different ways — each product can be used individually, and Demsey said AOL can offer One through a completely self-serve model; through full service, with AOL managing the campaigns for its customers; and everything in between.\nRelated Articles\nAol Buys Marketing Analytics Company Convertro For $101M (Memo) Adap.tv Introduces Linear TV To Its Ad-Buying Platform\n“This is as much a technological revolution as it is a culture and process revolution,” Demsey added — meaning that one of the big challenges involves convincing everyone in an organization to use these tools. So AOL has also had to refine how it brings customers on-board, and that’s also why a more full-service approach can be important.\nFinally, Demsey noted that the initial launch consists of advertiser tools, but there’s technology for publishers in the works, too.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

It's another monetization opportunity,\" O'Brien said about his open source desktop, which is designed to work with leading open source office suites including OpenOffice, StarOffice and IBM Symphony. \"We do see that request out there.\"\nThe Projity exec also hinted that the company is close to a deal to bundle OpenProj with Novell's SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop and has also had discussions with Red Hat and Ubuntu. OpenProj is currently bundled with Mandriva, another Linux distribution that is popular in Europe and is being marketed in the U.S. \"\n\"We've got major visibility at the distros. We are speaking to Red Hat, Novell, and Ubuntu and we're getting a warm reception because those companies are now orienting their desktops to the business community where ROI is important,\" he said.\nProjity claims that its open source project management desktop has been downloaded 175,000 times in its first three months on the market. It is released under the OSI-approved CPAL license.\nThe 6MB OpenProj download supports Linux, Macintosh and Windows and is free of charge. It comes with an open [Microsoft]Project filter.\nProjity makes its money on its commercial software-as-a-service offering called Project-ON-Demand, which has client and server side components and is offered at $19.99 per month.\nEven as the company steps ups its attack against Microsoft Project on that front, it is also considering offering its server-side components under an open source license. \"We're thrilled to open source our desktop and we'll have to address [the server-side],\" he said.\nProjity is turning up the heat on its No. 1 rival, Microsoft, whose dominant Project project management application is ubiquitous in the marketplace due to lack of competition, O'Brien claims.\nNext week, the company will launch a major revison of its Project-ON-Demand Saas offering that features a slick Ajax interface to improve usability and enhanced server-side reporting features. Projity also plans to offer team collaboration and time cards features.\nO'Brien is optimistic about his chances, claiming that Microsoft has failed to offer an Office 2007 bundle with Project included and is offering the standard version at $599 and Pro version at a steeper price of $999.00.\n\"I don't want to wake a giant but it may be hubris on Microsoft's part. You can't find an Office suite that includes Project and they've bumped the price. It's a very high priced market now and the number of competitors has dwindled to almost none. \"\nGiven that, Projity expects to see more interest in its SaaS offering and its new open source offering. He claims Projity has several large deals pending in Europe, including one company that replaced 3500 copies of Microsoft Project with OpenProj. He also claims that Peugot is using OpenProj with SLED on its desktops.\n\"There was a big gap out there and and so we know this is another cog in the wheel that helps the entire industry,\" he said. \"It's interesting to see the development of the open source marketplace. It's no longer just a fringe element of develping economies for free software. We don't run into objections about open source.\"\n\"A day in a life without Microsoft is becoming real,\" he added.\nO'Brien is an industry veteran who in the 1990s co-founded an ASP called Web Project that hosted project management software. It was financially unfeasible but the effort was udnerwritten by Sun and Cisco. In 2000, the company was acquired by Novient. Key execs including O'Brien waited until their non compete expired and in 2000 created Projity after seeing this large software sector \"completely abdicated\" to Microsoft, O'Brien said.\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

(Note: While ReadWrite takes device and data security seriously as a topic, it certainly does NOT endorse this kind of content. Please see  Auernheimer’s original blog post  if you’d like.)\nA few hours later, Auernheimer started to see the effects of his work. University students were hitting Twitter, Reddit, and other social media sites to complain about the printed flyers, while others scoured the Internet for the source of the controversy. Universities weren’t the only victims to the exploit, as some offices were also hit with the racist flyers.\nAuernheimer, who posts on white supremacist sites as well, said that the flyer had to be black and white unicode to ensure that all printers accepted it. Any bitmap images or color might have caused issues, especially with college printers that might have rules for printing.\nRacist hack prompts police response\nAuernheimer defends his right to print the racist flyers, claiming that all he did was communicate with internet-connected printers. Some university students and local newspapers have called it a hate crime , and police are investigating in at least one case.\nFor those that don’t know, Auernheimer is not stranger to stirring the pot. Along with Goatse Security, he exposed a flaw in AT&T’s security that allowed 114,000 iPad email addresses to be exposed. He has also attacked Planned Parenthood, and exposed the names of government officials on Ashley Madison and FriendFinder.\nWhile most will not agree with Auernheimer’s political and social views, he has once again shown that you can stir up thousands of people with only a few lines of code.\n", "deleted" : false }

(For the record, that's \"daddy\" as in \"mack daddy,\" as this e-newsletter clearly has zilch to do with parenting.)\nUrbanDaddy, which has about 315,000 subscribers and says it's doubling that year-over-year, is particularly notable for two quirky reasons: one, you have to be referred by a friend to join, which puts a choke on viral growth and keeps subscriber numbers on the low end, but gives it cachet. Two, it's a New York-based newsletter start-up that's never been affiliated with the Pilot Group--more unusual than you might think. That investment firm, headed by former MTV and AOL exec Bob Pittman, has quite the penchant for the newsletter niche: it took a majority stake in and then flipped Ideal Bite to Disney earlier this year, and reportedly has just sold DailyCandy to Comcast for $125 million.\nIt's likely that a sizeable portion of UrbanDaddy's readership can't actually afford the bottle-service nightclubs, private islands in the Baltic, and travel packages to eco-friendly Caribbean golf resorts that are detailed in its daily e-mails. But the company can score advertisements from high-end fashion and liquor brands that are within reach of the guys who want Ferraris, and that's what brings in the cash. (The site has not disclosed revenues.)\nUrbanDaddy also operates a small men's fashion blog, Kempt .\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

Full disclosure, I spoke with the producers of the 60 Minutes piece on background a few times over the past few months as they were putting it together, just to try to help them go in the right direction.\nContrary to the reaction of many of my Twitter friends, I think 60 Minutes got some key things right in the story, but they also got a couple of things wrong in there, too — most importantly they’re overlapping the Valley story with the government funding story. Here’s my take on their piece, which — to their credit — is one of the more comprehensive mainstream media looks at what was the VC cleantech phenomenon:\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n1). RIGHT: From a purely venture capital perspective, cleantech has been ugly and it has “crashed.” I don’t think you can argue rationally that this hasn’t happened; again, only in the venture capital, Silicon Valley ecosystem. And yes, there are a couple exceptions that emerged from the Valley that made it through, like Tesla.\nAdvertisement\nAs I’ve covered many times over the past six years, venture capitalists lost a lot of money on cleantech ( Kleiner Perkins being the poster child of this ), and many have now left the sector. At the same time, entrepreneurs widely know there’s very little money available for early stage “cleantech” startups anymore, and the limited partners that back venture funds don’t want the VCs to invest their money in anything called cleantech these days.\nAdvertisement\nThere was a very real bubble and bust that happened, though there are still firms around that have evolved and are sticking with it. Will it come back like the second wave of the internet? There will be some more successes in the future but I don’t think the equivalent massive amount of money from VCs will emerge again.\nAdvertisement\nGreen:Net 2010: Michael Copeland – Senior Writer, Fortune; Vinod Khosla – Founder, Khosla Ventures\nAdvertisement\nA lot of the 60 Minutes piece was trying to cover this Valley aspect and I think they did a good job of that. The VCs did lean on government connections and support at times, and they made a lot of mistakes.\nAdvertisement\nVinod Khosla is also the right guy to talk to, as he’s the enigma that says his firm is going to continue to fund the cleantech sector at an aggressive pace, despite the difficulties. It was probably pretty hard to find a VC that would admit on camera that she or he made a bunch of weak investments in cleantech and now, hat in hand, is exiting the scene.\nAdvertisement\n2). WRONG: Unfortunately, playing up the taxpayer-funded government green-flop angle in the piece was both stale and overblown. It’s been covered ad nauseum not only in the political arena, but also in more mainstream pieces like the Wired one two years ago .\nAdvertisement\nThere were a few companies in manufacturing that were backed by the Department of Energy loan program that were clear mistakes — Solyndra and Fisker — but some of the other companies mentioned in the piece were either very minor losses or also still have promising tech that is being developed under a different owner. Leslie Stahl named 9 companies that didn’t do well for various reasons (not all from the loan program) and then dramatically declared she’s exhausted from naming them all.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAs Michael Grunwald has pointed out in his book The New New Deal , government support — from the Department of Energy through the stimulus — has created a large amount of jobs over the years. Beyond the stimulus, solar panels and wind power have reached record levels in the U.S. in the last year and that’s also thanks to U.S. government support. Even within the loan program, there were more wins than the 60 Minutes piece let on, like the Ivanpah solar farm that created a lot of jobs outside of Las Vegas. The U.S. government needs to give more support to next-generation energy technologies, not less.\nAdvertisement\nPart of the problem with the 60 Minutes piece is that it’s combining the story of U.S. support for clean power and energy efficiency, with the Silicon Valley story. They’re totally separate and different. The subhead of the piece is a prime example of the confusing aligning of those two things:\nAdvertisement\n“Despite billions invested by the U.S. government in so-called “Cleantech” energy, Washington and Silicon Valley have little to show for it.”\nAdvertisement\nUm, does that include the huge gains in wind farms and solar panel projects in the U.S., or does that just mean that Solyndra didn’t work out? Because, Solyndra happened in the summer of 2011; two and a half years ago. The underlying problem is that “cleantech” is a convoluted term that can mean many things, and isn’t all that helpful as an organizing group. Let’s figure out in 2014 if we should kill that term or not.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n3). WRONG: The piece had a very, very light touch on Kior. The company’s stumbles are far bigger than explained in the story, from missing its volume production goals, to having a stock hovering between $1.50 and $2, down from an IPO price of $15 per share, to having a law suit from investors. Yes, it’s possible that they’ll pull through and meet expectations, but more likely is that they won’t. That’s just the realities of the difficult business.\nAdvertisement\n4). RIGHT: Because it’s 60 Minutes they end on an upbeat aspirational note, with a statement from Khosla on being a dreamer:\nAdvertisement\nIn fact you need dreamers to stretch. I probably have failed more times in my life than almost anybody I know. But that’s because I’ve tried more things. And I’m not afraid to fail because the consequences of avoiding failure are doing nothing.\nAdvertisement\nAs I said in this piece about Kleiner Perkins , I think the VCs that put money into some of these cleantech innovations actually deserve a bit of our admiration, despite that some of the investments weren’t so wise, and many haven’t yet proven to be good for their funds.\nAdvertisement\nThey tried to bring us jetpacks, and they hoped to create some real fundamental innovation in sectors like energy that are super important for the world. The rest of their peers made money off of sectors that don’t necessarily have a direct benefit for society like gaming, social media, or online commerce.\nAdvertisement\nMoney is the goal in the end either way, but the Valley has always been about risk taking, and the cleantech VCs took the biggest risks out of anyone in the Valley of the past half decade. Hopefully there’s a next wave of these investors that are making smaller, quieter, and more informed bets and will some day show there’s a model in the Valley that will work.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

The company isn't distributing it with SUS (Software Update Services), however.\nMicrosoft is also putting out some high-priority updates that aren't related to security, on Microsoft Update, Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services and Software Update Services.\nThere are currently five outstanding zero-day flaws in Microsoft products. eEye Research has them listed on its Zero-Day Tracker.\nThe most recently reported of the five is a Word 2000 vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to take over a PC with the rights of a logged-in user. It requires user interaction, such as a user opening a file manually off a Web site or from e-mail as an attachment. McAfee reported this as a vulnerability distinct from previous Word zero-day vulnerabilities, of which there has been a bumper crop lately.\nTo wit: In February, Microsoft put out a cumulative bulletin with patches for six problems in Word, five of which were rated as critical in the Office 2000 version. They included fixes for a malformed strong vulnerability, malformed data structure flaw, malformed object drawing glitch, malformed function problem and a Word count issue.\nMicrosoft has acknowledged that the outstanding vulnerability causes a denial of service for Word, but it claims that it's impossible to exploit. eEye notes, however, that with no technical details released, we can't be sure it's not exploitable. Still, the flaw is rated as being of only medium risk.\nThe other outstanding flaws, all of medium or low risk, are a flaw in Windows MessageBox, an Internet Connection Sharing denial of service, a local denial of service on Microsoft Office 2003 PowerPoint, and an RPC memory exhaustion issue.\nLast month's Patch Tuesday witnessed Microsoft's all-time high for security fixes, as the company shipped out a dozen bulletins to fix 20 holes in products, including 11 critical issues in Windows, Office, IE and even its own anti-virus tools.\nAccording to a Microsoft spokesperson, this is the fourth Patch Tuesday sans patches since Microsoft started the monthly update cycle in November 2005.\nThe spokesperson pointed to Microsoft Security Advisories as being a way for Microsoft to communicate security information to customers about issues that may not be classified as vulnerabilities and may not require a security bulletin. He also pointed to the MSRC Blog, for alerts around public threats.\nAs far as current open zero-days go, the spokesperson said that after Microsoft has completed its investigations, it will provide a security update, possibly an out-of-cycle update, if it's warranted.\n\"Microsoft is almost always investigating potential and existing vulnerabilities in an effort to help protect our customers,\" he said. \"Creating security updates that effectively fix vulnerabilities is an extensive process involving a series of sequential steps. There are many factors that impact the length of time between the discovery of a vulnerability and the release of a security update, and every vulnerability presents its own unique challenges. When a potential vulnerability is reported, designated product-specific security experts investigate the scope and impact of a threat on the affected product. Once the MSRC knows the extent and the severity of the vulnerability, they work to develop an update for every supported version affected. Once the update is built, it must be tested with the different operating systems and applications it affects, then localized for many markets and languages across the globe. In some instances, multiple vendors are affected by the same or similar issue, which requires a coordinated release.\"\n \n", "deleted" : false }

This is consistent with what I and others have observed about the majority of SMBs, even those with websites. The search engines want to reach this massive market directly but have found it very difficult to do so without working with established sales channels and partners (newspapers, yellow pages, webhosts, etc.) that have existing SMB relationships. That can be problematic in some cases because the various revenue sharing agreements diminish the available funds for a paid search buy (but that’s a lengthy topic for another time).\nFirst some context. Here’s a breakdown of US businesses by headcount according to US Census data:\nSource: US Census (2004)\nAll but a tiny fraction US businesses have less than 100 employees. Most have fewer than four.\nNow back to what the Microsoft survey found:\nThe study revealed that 59 percent of small businesses with Web sites don’t currently use paid search marketing, and of those, 90 percent have never even attempted it.\nNearly nine in 10 (89 percent) feared keywords may become too expensive.\nEighty-one percent questioned if paid search marketing is the best use of their marketing budgets.\nOne quarter of respondents believe paid search marketing is too complex.\nTwenty-one percent thought it would be too time-consuming.\nThirty-five percent felt they would need an agency to help set up a search marketing campaign.\nOpus Research recently found in an earlier SMB advertiser survey (n=1089, 8/08), among SMBs who did no online marketing, the main reason was confusion:\nSource: Opus Research, AllBusiness.com (2008)\nThis is “online marketing” in general and not search per se. But the findings, as the Microsoft data suggest, would be magnified for search among those not doing it. However the same Opus survey found that paid search was cited as the third most effective marketing method among a list of 15 media types, after email marketing and print newspapers. So those doing it have seen its value presumably.\nYet even among those SMBs that are doing search marketing, many are doing it in ways that diminsh the effectiveness of their spend. SEM platform provider Clickable found that more than 50% of 1,000 SMBs on its platform failed to implement conversion tracking and were thus wasting some of their budget by not really gaining insight into the true ROI of their keywords.\nWhile progressive SMBs and “e-tailers” were among the first to adopt paid search as a direct response medium, the majority of small businesses are mystified by the mechanics — the “how” — of search and need simple tools and/or third party help. Yet their spend is such that it may be hard for a third party without a substantially automated/scalable platform to build a sustainable business model around it. For example, Palore recently found the following about the average paid search spend of certain categories of SMBs:\nSource: Palore\nBut there are other data that show an even smaller monthly spend. The volume is great, but the spend is relatively low. Unless or until the engines can provide an even more simplified way to do paid search they’re unlikely to acquire large numbers of additional SMB advertisers, except through complex third party relationships. (Google “simple ads” has yet to appear .)\nThus for SMBs and search engines there will likely continue to be challenges and frustration — on both sides — for at least the foreseeable future.\nAbout The Author\nGreg Sterling\nGreg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.

The Seattle-based company, founded in 2005, has raised $40 million from venture capitalists, including one who backed Facebook. Wetpaint has been heralded by Jude O’Reilley (then at online-health startup Trusera , now at Amazon) as “stars in the consumer wiki space,” and a “power to the people.” But the star of wiki is now building on that success in a new and fascinating way, aiming to become a star of online entertainment media.\nWetpaint’s scalable Web-publishing content platform boasts over 1.3 million user-built sites , and gets 10 million unique pageviews a month. The hope is that user base will give Wetpaint a running start with its latest venture, Wetpaint Entertainment, today, in which it is diving into the entertainment media space face-first. The idea, co-founder and chief executive Ben Elowitz says, is to turn the traditional publishing industry on its ear.\n“Publishing is going through a massive transformation right now, and it really needs to find a new model—the audience has become so fragmented, so we really need to find a model,” he says. “Our goal is to revolutionize media by cracking the code on a profitable, scalable model for the publishing industry.”\nAt first glance, Wetpaint Entertainment sounds like a glorified network of TV fan sites—in the same vein as the sites driven by another Seattle-based startup, BuddyTV and the thousands of independent blogs and entertainment news sites. In fact, the creation is something very different. Wetpaint Entertainment’s 15 ‘channel’ sites, each dedicated to a different popular TV show, are the product of the intersection of multimedia videos and images, active social networks, and a team of professional editorial staff. It’s sort of a cross between social wiki technology, a Web-analytics company, and a magazine.\n“We started with the social wiki by Wetpaint platform, and as we did that we realized that there was a big opportunity around entertainment,” Elowitz says.\nThe result, he says, are topical sites chock full of content specifically tailored for the reader—or user, rather. It’s supposed to maximize the resources of the web, and integrating new technologies, to create a more efficient, comprehensive, and more interactive and content-rich site at a fraction of the cost of other mainstream media outlets, like People magazine or US Weekly.\nWetpaint homepage\n“If we were People magazine trying to do this, it would take hundreds of people,” Elowitz says. “We are able to publish content at about a fifth of the cost, because we’re using technology to be more efficient.”\nMuch of the technology he’s referring to stems from Wetpaint’s original Web-based tool for creating wikis that were both easy to use, and powered with social networking tools. By developing a publishing platform heavily mired in technology, Elowitz says his team of 35-full time staff (the company laid off 15 employees in July 2009 ) has found a more interactive, faster, customizable, and more advertiser-primed way of publishing.\n“One of the themes that we’re attacking in entertainment, is there’s this bridge between Hollywood and the real life, and we’re able to cross that bridge,” he says. “Traditionally, top publishers have had a really high consumer experience, but at a really high cost, and that cost isn’t sustainable.”\nWetpaint Entertianment is launching today with 15 sites centered around TV shows that are popular with young women: “The Vampire Diaries,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “America’s Next Top Model,” “Castle,” “Hellcats,” “Nikita,” “Glee,” “Dancing With The Stars,” “Top Chef,” “Pretty Little Liar,” “Bachelorette,” “The Bachelor,” “Gossip Girl,” “Jersey Shore” and “The Real Housewives of DC.” On each site there are as many as 200 updates daily on topics surrounding each fan base—show news, spoilers, gossip, fashion worn by the stars (an easy in for high-end advertisers, Elowitz notes), top 10 lists, music from the show, and pictures and video both aggregated from syndication partners—which he could not name—and created in-house.\n“We have original video productions where we recap a week in TV, or take people off the street and re-enact scenes from episodes,” Elowitz says.” This is all really about completing that … Next Page »\nThea Chard is a correspondent for Xconomy Seattle.

The company’s platform builds profiles that can encompass    both scores and external signals, such as the prospect’s intent or    whether their company offers a freemium product.\n“Predictive scoring and profiling technologies add tremendous value when    it comes to sales and marketing workflows for account or lead    prioritization, inbound marketing and demand generation, so it’s a    natural extension to bring these advanced techniques into your    advertising strategies,” said Vik Singh, co-founder and CEO of Infer. “The most successful approaches are those that combine proven,    best-of-breed platforms, as opposed to force fitting a one-size-fits-all    solution that applies predictive to both advertising and automation.    They are two different sides of the coin, each deserving dedicated focus    and depth to do proper justice and to achieve significant gains in    marketing and sales. That’s why we developed an open architecture that    intelligently feeds our insights into your stack to make CRM, marketing    automation and adtech systems all infinitely smarter.”\nBuilding Data-Rich Profiles for Hyper-Segmentation\nThe Infer    Profile Management Platform first combines data that’s trapped in    companies’ internal systems with thousands of proprietary third-party    signals. It also pulls in valuable buyer intent signals from marketing    automation platforms, advertising systems and other data vendors to    proactively identify new ‘interested’ accounts to target. Infer    intelligently matches, merges, interprets and filters all of these data    points so that go-to-market teams can create data-rich, descriptive    prospect profiles using a broader range of customer attributes than ever    before. Through thoughtful hyper-segmentation of these high-potential    profiles, companies can greatly improve effectiveness and efficiency in    a variety of sales and marketing programs.\nHyper-Targeting ABM Campaigns for Greater Impact\nInfer connects with leading advertising systems to share these carefully    defined profiles, and orchestrate whichever actions a company wants to    perform on them. For example, by feeding rich Infer Profiles into    Terminus, a marketer can show personalized display ads to particular B2B    accounts, i.e. best-fit marketers who use the Marketo platform. “Infer’s    open architecture makes it simple to take your account-based marketing    strategy to the next level,” said Eric Spett, CEO at Terminus. “Companies can pull their ideal customer profiles from Infer into our    platform, and effortlessly bring predictive into daily workflows that    provide critical ‘air-cover’ for ABM campaigns, and result in faster    progressions through every stage of the marketing and sales cycle.”\nMeasuring Campaign Results through Predictive Scoring\nComing full circle, Infer’s Predictive Ad Targeting Platform can    leverage the company’s statistically accurate fit and behavior scoring    models for greater predictive power, a deeper level of segmentation, and    more insightful campaign measurement. Infer Predictive Scoring helps    marketers measure the quality of the leads they are reaching, make    course corrections as needed, and ensure that their messaging and    channels are effectively aligned with the company’s target profiles.\n“Infer’s profiling and scoring technologies, in tandem with ad platforms    like AdRoll and Terminus, help us easily employ predictive targeting,” said Alex Acker, senior manager of marketing and insights at Nitro. “By    working smarter in this way, we’re able to boost engagement at the top    of our funnel, and get a whole lot more for every advertising dollar.”\nInfer’s open approach and integrations with other partners like AdRoll,    Eloqua, Google Analytics, HubSpot, InsideView, InsightSquared, Marketo,    Pardot, Salesforce and Social123 help to make an organization’s existing    sales and marketing stack more impactful and effective.\nAbout Infer\nFounded in 2010, Infer delivers a predictive sales and marketing    platform that helps companies win more customers. It leverages proven    data science to rapidly model the untapped customer profile data sitting    in an enterprise, along with thousands of signals from the web, and help    drive a company’s growth strategy through valuable predictive workflows.

Financial terms of the deal were not released, although Scrapblog had raised more than $10 million from investors including Disney’s Steamboat Ventures. In recent months, however, Scrapblog’s traffic had dropped off sharply and Jill Braff, the Glu Mobile (NSDQ: GLUU) veteran who joined the company as CEO a year-and-a-half ago, stepped down in November.\nAsked about Scrapblog’s recent difficulties during an interview, Mixbook CEO Andrew Laffoon said the site’s traffic had been on a “slow decline” in part because of unspecified “operational challenges.” By contrast, he said his own site had been growing quickly and its financials were “very strong” — something that had allowed the company to purchase a once-larger rival. He would not say how the deal was structured or whether any cash changed hands.\nAdvertisement\nWhile both sites let users put together scrapbooks, photobooks, and calendars using photos gathered from elsewhere online, Laffoon said Mixbook had initially focused on the photobook space, while Scrapblog is better known for its scrapbooks.

wireline and wireless traffic\nMore like this\nSaaS service shows “the correlation between all the moving parts,” says satisfied early user\nEmail a friend\nUse commas to separate multiple email addresses\nFrom\nYour message has been sent.\nSorry\nNetwork World | Apr 18, 2016 5:29 AM    PT\nRELATED TOPICS\nComments\nStartup Nyansa Inc. today launched a SaaS-based IT network analytics service that can inspect, analyze and correlate wireline and wireless data to help large campus IT shops speed network problem resolution and create performance baselines that can be used for network tuning, gauging the impact of network changes, and justifying new network investments.\nThe CEO and co-founder of the company, which has raised $12 million in venture backing, is Abe Ankumah, onetime Senior Director of Products and Business Operations at Aruba Networks, who went on to become Director of Client Products and Alliances at Meraki.  When Meraki was acquired by Cisco in 2012 Ankumah became Director of Cisco’s Cloud Networking Group, but left in late 2013 to cofound Nyansa with CTO Anand Srinivas and VP of Engineering Daniel Kan.\nNyansa (pronounced “ni-ans-sah”) prides itself on being able to gather and inspect wireline AND wireless data -- and even wireless metrics -- for use in performance analysis, and stresses that it doesn’t require agents on end user client devices and that it can correlate and summarize, in plain English, “data for every client network transaction from initial connection to application access.”\nThe meshing of the wired and wireless worlds is a good leg up for Nyansa, says Zeus Kerrvala, founder and principal analyst with ZK Research.  “We’re living in a world where everything is connected, and in many organizations wireless is the primary connection, so being able to incorporate the two is critical,” he says. “Wired and wireless visibility is typically done separately and you end up having to correlate this stuff manually.  There are probably some engineers out there that can do that, but most companies probably don’t have that level person.  I think there is a real opening here.”\nHow it works\nWhile the company’s Voyance service does not require installation of hardware appliances or client agents, customers will need to install one or more of Nyansa’s virtual machine-based “crawlers” that “extract and inspect all wired traffic from a mirrored span or tap port as traffic passes through network switches,” the company says.  “This information is fused with wireless metrics gathered from WLAN controllers.  Voyance currently supports Cisco, Aruba and Ruckus WLAN controlled environments.”\nThe crawlers look at all data but only forward performance metrics to the cloud for correlation by the Voyance cloud analytics engine, which is hosted in AWS.  CTO Srinivas says that every gigabit of traffic results in about 500K bit/sec of information that is forwarded to the cloud for analysis.  “Some of our largest customers are moving 3G to 4Gbps, so they’re seeing 2.5M-3Mbps going up to the cloud.”\nThe ability to see, collect and analyze both wireline and wireless data is key because Wi-Fi is “causing the biggest pain for the network ops guys because it has become the primary way people connect and it’s harder to troubleshoot those problems,” says VP of Marketing David Callisch, formerly of Ruckus.\n“Within Wi-Fi we can see eight or ten metrics, everything from channel width, feature set, what access points are deployed and whether band steering is being used,” he says.  “So if someone calls in complaining about a Wi-Fi problem, we can look at everything from the time they connect and every network service they go through to hit an application.  It might not be a Wi-Fi problem after all.  Maybe they’re not getting an IP address, or not authenticating to a server or the application is performing poorly.  We can help guide IT ops.”\nEarly user Mike Fitzgerald, Network Architect and Senior Network Engineer at Brandeis University, says that kind of insight is valuable.  Voyance “sees the conversations between the wireless clients and the underlying support -- the DNS servers, the DHCP servers -- so it will call out that, ‘This person seems to be having a bad experience, but it isn’t your wireless, its their DHCP didn’t work or your DNS lookups are slow or latency is off.’  So it is a great tool because you can go to one place and get a lot of root cause analysis.”\nThose types of problems, Fitzgerald says, “would be hard to see unless you have a tool like this that can show you the correlation between all the moving parts.  It has also helped us identify behaviors on our network that we didn’t know existed because they weren’t hard faults. Stuff just gets slow every once in a while and you’d like to know why.  And now its like, ‘Oh look, when that stuff seems slow it is because this thing is happening over here,’ so it is great tool that way.”\nBaselining benefits\nBut root cause analysis is only one thing Voyance was designed to address, Srinivas says. \nOnce installed, Voyance starts building a baseline of the environment, a profile that enables the company to address a range of other needs, including analyzing how network changes effect performance and end user experience.\n“That’s one thing IT struggles with,” Callisch says.  “They put in a new DNS server, and they don’t know if that change was good or bad.  With Voyance, they can show what actually happened.”\nCritical to that analysis is keeping the load the same so you’re comparing apples to apples, Srinivas says: “Let’s take DHCP as an example.  You added another DHCP server and you expect it to reduce latency by X.  You have to keep the load the same to see if it actually made a difference.  Because we collect all this data, we can find periods of time when the load was the same for the before-and-after analysis.” \nBecause Nyansa collects all this data in the cloud, it also makes it possible to compare and contrast anonymized customer network analytics so companies can see how their environments stack up to those of similar sized operations in their industry, Srinivas says. \nSticking with a DHCP example, Voyance makes it possible for a customer considering DHCP configuration changes to see what happened when other customers tried a similar change.  “We don’t make a recommendation as to whether you should do it or not,” Srinivas says, “but, without saying who they are, we can show you what happened when other people did it.”\nHaving the ability to compare and contrast also can help you figure out what projects to take on, he says. \n“Let’s say network clients that cannot connect to DNS went from 0.5% to 0.3%,” Srinivas says.  “The question any IT person would need to answer is, ‘Should I work on making that 0% or is 0.3% actually good enough?’”  With Voyance you can see what the norm is for similar institutions and then focus your energy on efforts that matter.\nThat also has implications for network investments.  If, for example, peer operations deliver better end user experiences, you can drill down and possibly use that information to justify, say, an upgrade to gigabit Wi-Fi.\nAsked if any customers are worried about sharing this type of information, Callisch said none of the company’s roughly 25 customers have yet refused. \nThis experience sharing approach is “pretty cool,” says Kerrvala of ZK Research.  “I read all the time about how IT isn’t that proactive.  As a former IT guy I take offense at that.  It isn’t that they aren’t proactive. They haven’t really had the tools to be proactive.  You can’t manage a digital network with tools that were made for a different era, and that was what engineers really have had to do to date.  It is getting more and more important to have management based on analytics because that lets you move to a more predictive model.”\nEarly user Fitzgerald at Brandeis says the university is just starting to work with Voyance’s compare and contrast functions: “We seem to compare pretty well.  There are some places where we might be a little off so we’ll look at that.”\nBut the ability of the service to provide a bigger picture view is already paying dividends, he says.  “We have a couple of buildings that have higher incidents of poorer performance and we didn’t think we had a problem in those buildings.   No one is complaining, but now we have something to go investigate.”\nIn another case he says the service “showed us that one DNS server was getting hammered all the time compared to the rest of them and suggested we look into that.  So we did and we found a firewall was pretty much using the same source port all the time so the load balancer was thinking it was all one conversation and was routing all its requests to one server.  Its that kind of stuff where the value of this kind of product shines.”\nNyansa says it is targeting large campus environments with tens of thousands of devices in vertical markets such as education, manufacturing and healthcare.\nSubscriptions to the SaaS service are available in 1-3 or 5 year contracts for different size buckets -- small, medium, large, x-large and custom.\nThis story, \"Network analytics startup provides insight into wireline and wireless traffic\" was originally published by Network World .\nRELATED TOPICS\n", "deleted" : false }

A visit to the blacklisted domains now results in the ominous looking message from Homeland Security below.\nWhile the graphic is pretty scary, Market Ticker’s  Karl Denninger points out the websites themselves and the servers they run on have not actually been seized , just the domains.\n“That’s a lot of staff attorney time and trouble to get a big fat nothing out of it, which is exactly what they get going down this road.  Why?  Because all they can do is redirect the domain pointers which will do exactly nothing when the sites re-register under a top-level domain not under the US Government’s jurisdiction – and there are lots of them.”\nDomains under US jurisdiction currently include anything controlled by Verisign which puts .com site owners in a legal relationship with the United States. According to Denninger, all afflicted site owners need to do is move to a non-US controlled top level domain in order to dodge further ICE seizures.\nSome have already started to migrate to other domains, though it’s likely choices like .net won’t be any safer. Torrent-Finder owner Waleed Gad El Kareem said he switched his site over to Torrent-Finder.info the moment he saw the ICE message on Torrent-Finder.com, posting the new site’s address on Twitter.\nHip hop site RapGodfathers has aggressively followed suit with its own .info address, using Twitter to get the word out about the move and asking people to retweet as well as @replying fans with its new domain.\nEveryone please retweet our new link, lots of people still don't know about it. http://www.RapGodFathers.info #RGF\n— RGF.iS (@RapGodFathers) November 27, 2010\nOnsmash seems to have not made the move over, but is soliciting emails from fans on Twitter who oppose the domain name seizure as well as tweeting out stuff like “THEY CAN NEVER STOP US!!!” I’ve emailed them and sister site dajaz1.com about possible plans to move to a different domain and am waiting to hear back.\nARTISTS: If you oppose the seizure of @OnSMASH pls send an email to freeonsmash@gmail.com & express why. Your participation is appreciated!\n— Hof // OnSMASH (@HofOnSMASH) November 28, 2010\nEven the counterfeit sites have caught on, an email I sent to http://www.2009Jerseys.com was met with the following auto response, “Notice: The original Domain Name has been suspended, please visit the new domain name http://www.2009Jerseys.net , We apologize for the inconvenience. If there is new information, we will first time inform you.” The people behind Dvdcollects.com have decided to focus all their energy on the yet unfettered Bestcollects.com according to their Facebook page.\nIf it really is that easy to pick up and move on its hard to believe that the other 70 or so sites won’t find friendlier domains on which to land, rendering ICE’s efforts ultimately futile. If anything, the seizures serve as lesson to all possibly infringing sites — Steer clear of the .com top level domain.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Those include smaller companies such as Xora and Citrix, and will eventually include bigger names such as SAP, Microsoft, and Salesforce.com.\n\"Historically, app providers gave a fully functioning app for desktop and a limited [version] on mobile,\" Tim Wagner, vice president and general manager of Samsung Mobile's enterprise business, told CNET. \"Now companies want full functionality on mobile devices, and they want it on mobile first.\"\nAt launch, Samsung is not creating new apps but is helping software makers tweak their apps to take advantage of unique Samsung device features such as its S Pen, gestures, and screen mirroring. For example, health-related apps may now incorporate Samsung's gesture technology to allow ER doctors to use a tablet after they've already scrubbed in for surgery. Or other apps, such as the ProntoForm offering, will allow users to use the Air View function of Samsung's S Pen to see more info about a certain field on an electronic form. Samsung also will work with developers to make apps that work with its\nGalaxy Gear\nsmartwatch.\nSamsung, which became the world's largest smartphone vendor more than a year ago, has been aggressively ramping up its push to attract corporate users for its technology. The company launched Samsung for Enterprise, or SAFE, technology two years ago in an attempt to make its devices more business friendly. Its many features include encryption, VPN connectivity, and mobile device management capabilities such as remote wipe. And it also launched its Knox security platform to make its devices secure enough for the U.S. Defense Department and other organizations.\nSamsung's Galaxy Note 3 includes new features for the S Pen. Josh Miller/CNET\nWhile many companies have focused on mobile devices, traditional enterprise applications haven't always translated as well to smartphones and tablets. By working with developers and business solution providers, Samsung will ensure that apps work smoothly with its devices and include functionality beyond the standard versions available for Android and other mobile device operating systems. That could give the company an edge over rivals and help it attract more business users at a time the overall smartphone market is slowing.\nFor BlackBerry, Samsung's move couldn't come at a worse time. The company late last week threw in the towel on the consumer mobile market, saying instead that it would focus on the business and \"prosumer\" market. A few days later, BlackBerry revealed that it had agreed to sell itself for $4.7 billion. A big reason for its decline is the success of rivals like Samsung and Apple, not only with consumers but also with business users. Workers who bring their own devices to the office have tended to favor those from Apple and Samsung, rather than phones from BlackBerry.\nSamsung doesn't disclose its share of the business user market, but it's clearly chipping away at BlackBerry's stronghold. The company considers enterprise users to be one of the top three biggest growth opportunities in mobile -- if not the biggest opportunity -- and it plans to become No. 1 in that market within the next 12 to 18 months, Wagner said.\n\"We're in a very unique position here in the US market and globally to accelerate our success based on the competitive positions of a few folks,\" Wagner said, though he declined to talk about BlackBerry specifically. \"Because of what we're able to do on the device side and the security side and now focus on a very different engagement model with solutions, we're going to pick up a tremendous amount of momentum as we go into Q4 and 2014.\"\nHere's the full list of Samsung's initial Solutions Exchange partners: Accellion; AccuCode -- AOBar and AOLaunchPad; Actsoft Advanced Wireless Forms; AirWatch; Apriva; Belkin -- Store and Charge, and Tablet Stage; BrainPop; CellTrak; CellTrust -- SecureSMS PULSE, SecureSMS COMMAND ANYWHERE, and SecureSMS TRACK ANYWHERE; Centrify; Citrix -- Podio and Receiver; clickSoftware -- ClickMobile and ClickSchedule; Comply 365; DecisionPoint -- ApexWare, ContentSentral, and Custom Mobile Application Development; Fiberlink -- MaaS 360; Genband Smart Office; LIA; Mi-Co; Mlevel; Mobelisk; MobileIron; Moki Mobility; ProntoForms; Samsung TecTiles; SoftPro -- SignDoc Mobile; Soonr Workplace; SOTI MobiControl; Stratix; Telenav; Ultimeta; XORA; XRS; and XYZMO SIGNificant Signature Capture.\n", "deleted" : false }

He is also the author of  The Intellectual Devotional  series.\nSummary\nInstead of a chapter-by-chapter or entrepreneur-by-entrepreneur summary, I’ve taken the “playbooks” for all 41 entrepreneurs and organized them into categories. Most of the advice falls under idea generation, which should tell you how crucial it is.\nIdea generation\nChris Anderson, founder of Future Publishing and CEO of TED Talks: Observe people’s real passions to figure out what they want.\nCharles Best, founder of DonorsChoose.org: Don’t just scratch your own itch, but an itch you actually care about.\nSara Blakely, founder of Spanx: Cultivate a vision for your product by devoting time to thinking, honing in on a clear goal (hers: get on the Oprah Winfrey Show), and solicit feedback not from family but people who can help.\nSteve Blank, founder of E.piphany and author of The Startup Owner’s Manual: Start with your core expertise (something you have business experience in), focus on an idea that truly excites you, and don’t dismiss entrepreneurship education.\nRodney Brooks, founder of iRobot and Rethink Robotics: Identify the intersection of your talents and the ways you imagine the world being a better place. Also identify “megatrends” that will create major new markets.\nJeff Bussgang, founder of Open Market, Upromise, and Flybridge Capital Partners: Focus on customer pains that are a high priority for them, and build a solution that has immediate and obvious benefit.\nMarc Cenedella, founder of TheLadders: Find the intersection of your abilities and your passion, and do something nobody else can do.\nRobin Chase , founder of Zipcar: Take advantage of excess capacity (assets people have but don’t use all the time), enable collaborative consumption , and figure out what you’re good at before finding a market.\nChip Conley, founder of Joie de Vivre Hospitality: Approach the market like an outsider unburdened by assumptions or traditions.\nChris Dixon, founder of SiteAdvisor, Founder Collective, and Hunch: Find founder/market fit, and fill “whitespaces” (places where there is demand but no supply).\nCaterina Fake, founder of Flickr and Hunch, chairman of Etsy: Make something that people would use every day.\nMitch Free, founder of MFG.com: Ideas will find you, rather than the other way around.\nEileen Gittins, founder of Blurb: Pick a market that is large, growing, and within your reach.\nJoe Green, founder of Causes: To decide between ideas, flesh them out first and then compare.\nScott Heiferman, founder of i-traffic, Fotolog, and Meetup: Find an idea that you’re obsessed with; and focus on things that are actually useful.\nReid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn: Pick the biggest idea you can handle; and pick ideas where you can be ten times better than the competition.\nBen Horowitz, founder of Opsware: Make something that’s ten times better than the competition’s.\nCyrus Massoumi, founder of ZocDoc: Solve one of your users’ top problems, and focus on one area and one sector.\nStephen and Heidi Messer, founders of LinkShare: Find opportunities that other people don’t see.\nHosain Rahman, founder of Jawbone: Focus on a full experience, and build products that make it better; and focus on something customers care about.\nAdeo Ressi, founder of TheFunded.com and The Founder Institute: Start with multiple ideas and narrow them down; find the intersection of your strengths and the world’s deficits.\nKevin Ryan, founder of AlleyCorp, CEO of Gilt Groupe: Pick ideas that you can execute on, because execution is more important; and pick ideas that you’re obsessed with.\nKirill Sheynkman, founder of Stanford Technology Group, Plumtree Software, and Elastra Corporation, managing director of RTP Ventures: Make something better or faster.\nJeff Stewart, founder of Mimeo, Urgent Career, and Lenddo: Start with lots of ideas and pit them against each other.\nCustomer development, launch, and early stages\nAnderson: Hone in on passionate niches of early adopters.\nConley: Start small to catch mistakes fast and save money.\nFree: The only way to test the market is to actually test the market.\nGansky: Set aside time to fully understand your business before launch.\nGittins: Look for three assumptions to validate.\nGreen: For cause-based organizations, motivate people by creating relationships with them and leading by example.\nHoffman: To get a head start, launch an idea before it sounds like an obvious solution.\nMassoumi: Start by understanding your end user.\nRessi: Put as little money into an early company as possible, until you’re sure it can survive on its own.\nStewart: Look for data to make predictions, then listen to feedback from the customer.\nJay Walker, founder of Walker Digital and Priceline: Don’t only talk to people who are your target customers, but other people, too – they may have unique insights.\nCofounders, company culture, and hiring\nBest: Trust your team to improve processes within the company.\nMatt Blumberg, founder of Return Path: Run your office with the mentality of a party host, eager to make everyone comfortable.\nCase: Hire people who can move the company forward, not just handle its present condition.\nLisa Gansky, founder of Ofoto: It’s okay if personalities at the office clash slightly – you get more “spark.”\nGardner: Share information freely.\nSeth Goldman, founder of Honest Tea: Help your employees grow into new roles.\nJeffrey Hollender, founder of Seventh Generation and American Sustainable Business Council: Be transparent to the point of discomfort;

and expect to be laughed at when you enter a market.\nKevin Efrusy, founder of IronPlanet and Corio, general partner at Accel: Be courageous enough to shift direction rather than trying to save a dying idea; take risks on opportunities that could be big; if the market is being disrupted, be sure to change along with it.\nFake: If you don’t find the right problem and the right people to work on it, even working 24/7 isn’t going to cut it; and look out for side projects that could become the focus of your business.\nGansky: First define, then refine, then scale your business.\nGardner: Diversify your paying customers (and hence your risk).\nGoldman: Understand your core task, value, or skill and stick to it.\nGreen: Be on the lookout for opportunities that could be big.\nHorowitz: Set out to be a monopoly, but still keep watch on your competition.\nTony Hsieh, founder of LinkExchange and Venture Frogs, CEO of Zappos: Be on the lookout for ways to evolve ahead of your competition; be like MacGyver and make things work with what you have.\nMcCann: Prioritize your tasks and figure out what can be done imperfectly.\nRahman: To keep up, you need to innovate all the time.\nLinda Rottenberg, founder of Endeavor Global: To expand, wait until you’re “pulled” into new markets by supporters and customers; and to get to your big vision, practice “minnovation” (small tweaks along the way).\nSheynkman: Define your revenue model clearly.\nStewart: A business is composed of hundreds of small ideas around pricing, marketing, manufacturing, etc.; and to motivate yourself, try to avoid stagnation.\nWalker: Recognize that problems are complex, since they involve humans.\nBest: Give your users transparent choice.\nConley: The customer experience should be joyful.\nPersonal\nDachis: Be a Renaissance man to give yourself broad experience and knowledge.\nDixon: Study the history of business and technology to better predict the future.\nEcko: If you’re an artist or creative, learn to control the emotions that come along with that; and accept criticism and negative feedback.\nGittins: Be willing to accept critiques of your idea.\nHsieh: Be humble to avoid overconfidence.\nMcCann: Surround yourself with worthy people and ideas because you will unconsciously absorb them.\nMessers: Be prepared for your different roles at different stages of a startup.\nMusk: Try to avoid wishful thinking.\nNovogratz: Focus on your vision and potential rather than being bogged down by mistakes; and recognize how much help you’ve gotten from people who lived before you.\nRottenberg: Strive to be called “crazy.”\nRyan: Allocate your time by figuring out what leads to the biggest returns.\nSheynkman: Observe and participate in all different roles in your company so you understand them.\nWalker: Stop and think.\nBig vision and goals\nTom Gardner, founder of The Motley Fool: Know your end game.\nHarrison: Your purpose and passion should come through in everything you do;

This book is chock-full of advice, but that’s part of the problem. If you read it straight through, your brain will start swimming in all these different, sometimes conflicting tips. I’d recommend buying it, putting it on the shelf, and maybe reading one person’s “chapter” (six pages) per night. That’ll give you time to think about each individual’s journey, process their individual advice, and see how it applies to your startup. Ultimately, I think, it’s your job to come up with your own “playbook.”\nShare this:\n", "deleted" : false }

It consumes media like a monstrous couch potato. Now it's getting larger, and way more useful for online video services.\nDavid Zax 10.27.10 12:25 AM\nReal-time broadcast monitoring service Critical Mention just added 50 top U.S. radio stations to the roster of broadcast streams it digitizes and renders into easily searchable text, it announced yesterday.\nThere is a dizzying amount of TV and radio out there. If you're a brand manager—or, especially at this time of year, a campaign manager—and you want to keep track of what's said about you, where do you turn? Critical Mention's latest platform ingests and digitizes over 27 hours of content every 60 seconds (more than YouTube handles in the same span of time). Its clients can search eight million video clips and 10 terabytes of indexed TV data. If a guest on a Fox affiliate in L.A. talks trash about one of Critical's clients, that client will receive an alert and can view the clip online within seconds of airing. Critical's indexing tentacles now reach into Canada, Europe, and even the Middle East.\nCritical Mention has many competitors in the real-time broadcast monitoring field. So besides its size, what sets Critical Mention apart from the pack? Critical's CEO Sean Morgan last year tapped former Apple R&D guru Tom Gilley to help scale the business, improving technology such as the all-important voice-to-text algorithms. The company \"timecodes every word to its moment in a video,\" Morgan tells Fast Company. That means users can \"click on one word, click on another word, and they've edited the video.\"\nWhat really sets Critical Mention apart, according to Morgan, is that it's actually one of three components of Critical Media . The umbrella company also comprises syndicaster.tv , which lets networks migrate their content to the web, and clipsyndicate.com , which helps them—you guessed it—syndicate that media.\nThis three-pronged strategy, moving beyond capture and alerts to distribution, gives Critical Media a much wider reach. According to Morgan's jargon of choice, Critical Media is a global video ecosystems company. \"We are the de facto aggregator of video as it is taken off of airwaves and put online,\" he says. Hundreds of broadcasters use syndicaster.tv to post clips to their own sites. Critical Mention serves clients on both ends of the media equation—not just those reacting to content, but also those producing it.\n[Image: flickr user SashaW ]\nGet the latest Fast Company stories delivered to your inbox daily.\nSend\nI'd also like to receive special Fast Company offers\nMust Reads\n", "deleted" : false }

Across our different markets, we are taking bold strategic measures to shape our business and the market. We are accelerating investments in spectrum, networks, and systems, and transforming our cost structure. We strive to deliver a great customer experience with innovative products and plans,\" the CEO said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"I am pleased that we are gaining good momentum on our growth initiatives in the enterprise segment for cybersecurity, cloud, and Smart City services in Singapore and the region.\"\nWithin Singapore, its mobile business revenue was up 2 percent, to SG$530 million, with 134,000 4G customers added in the quarter to take its total 4G subscriber base to 2 million. Post-paid average revenue per user (ARPU) was down 2 percent, to SG$74, due to less data roaming.\nThe company's fixed TV revenue in Singapore was down 6 percent, to SG$60 million, with ARPU down 3 percent, at SG$40. Both of these were dragged down due to customers who signed up for the pay TV service for the 2014 FIFA World Cup only, and subsequently cancelled their subscriptions. Excluding these World Cup subscriptions, ARPU rose by 7 percent and revenue by 13.2 percent year on year from the same period last year.\nSingtel gained 22,000 fixed-line fibre customers within Singapore during the quarter to June, bringing the telco's total customer base to 440,000.\nSingtel Group's entire global mobile customer base, encompassing its businesses in Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, India, the Philippines, and Thailand, rose by 8 percent this quarter, to 565 million subscribers.\nGlobal mobile communications were up 3.6 percent year on year, from SG$316 million last year to SG$327 million. Sale of equipment jumped by 53.1 percent, from SG$51 million to SG$78 million. Fixed broadband also saw an increase, from SG$50 million to SG$53 million.\nThe company's global pay TV, international telephone, and national telephone segments all fell, however: Pay TV by 1.5 percent, from SG$55 million to SG$54 million; international telephone by 3.6 percent, from SG$53 million to SG$51 million; and national telephone by 5 percent, from SG$32 million down to SG$31 million.\nThe falls in telephone usage and pay TV mark a continuing trend in consumers shifting from traditional voice and TV services to using data for communications and streaming entertainment.\nAccordingly, Singtel last month switched on its 4G+ network , becoming the first telco in Southeast Asia to offer a tri-band 4G network using LTE-900, with the upgrade promising to provide customers who own compatible mobile devices with improved 4G coverage, most notably underground and in indoor areas.\n\"Demand for data is growing exponentially, and we are always looking for ways to improve the mobile experience for our customers. Our goal is to deliver the most reliable and seamless connectivity,\" Singtel's VP of mobile marketing Diana Chen said at the launch in late July.\n\"We have invested heavily over the past year to improve the quality and extent of coverage, particularly indoor coverage. We have also enhanced zones that have been in need of a signal boost.\"\nSingtel in addition revealed a partnership with McDonald's to outfit 123 fast-food restaurants with a Wi-Fi service by mid-2016. Unlimited access to the network is free for Singtel customers to access until November, and will be thereafter be capped at 2GB per customer per month.\nIn June, along with other Singapore telcos M1 and StarHub, Singtel announced that it would be switching off its 2G network services by April 2017.\n\"Today, the majority of mobile customers are on 3G and 4G networks; only an extremely small percentage of customers remain on 2G-only mobile devices,\" a joint statement from the three companies said.\nThe results on Thursday underline the effect of the weakened Australian currency on Singtel's overall revenues and profit, an impact that resulted in the Singaporean telco seeking permission to be delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in April.\n\"After careful consideration, the Singtel board has determined that there are minimal shareholder benefits from maintaining Singtel's listing on the ASX. The delisting will also have the effect of reducing the costs arising from dual-listing requirements,\" the company said at the time.\nSingtel largely operates in Australia under the Optus brand, which simultaneously announced its results for the quarter. The Singtel subsidiary recorded an increase in net profit of 19.5 percent, from AU$164 million last year to AU$196 million this year.\nOperating revenue was AU$2.3 billion for the second quarter of 2015, an 11.3 percent year-over-year growth in constant currency terms from the AU$2.1 billion reported during the same period last year, while EBITDA grew by 7.3 percent for the quarter, from AU$597 million in the three months to June last year, to AU$641 million this year.\nLast month, iiNet shareholders voted in favour of TPG's AU$1.5 billion takeover bid . The acquisition, which is yet to be approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the court, will result in TPG becoming Australia's second-largest telco, eclipsing Optus' numbers by increasing its customer base to 1.7 million.\nOptus' primary rival Telstra also reported its results (PDF) on Thursday, recording a net profit after tax of AU$4.29 billion for the 2014-15 financial year, down AU$260 million or 5.8 percent year on year from last year's AU$4.55 billion. EBITDA decreased by 3.5 percent, down from AU$11.1 billion to AU$10.7 billion.\nAustralia's dominant telco attributed its loss in net profit to the sale of its Hong Kong mobile business, increased price competition from its rivals, and significant investment in its mobile 4G network. However, it is continuing to see growth in its mobile data, network applications and services, and IPTV businesses.\nSingapore's third-largest telco, M1, last month announced a SG$90 million profit for the first six months of 2015, an increase of 3.8 percent year on year, with service revenue of SG$408.6 million.

The head of the division is Mary Lou Jepsen, cofounder of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) Project and founder and former CEO of Pixel Qi , a startup that makes displays that are readable in direct sunlight.\nThe report says that Google X is hard at work creating \"large-scale video displays\" that are \"composed of smaller screens that plug together like Legos to create a seamless image.\" The modular design would allow for different screen shapes and sizes, just by moving the modules around.\nThis sounds like most large-format displays already in existence, such as the Christie MicroTiles  pictured above. The Google X difference is that the group is trying to figure out how to make modules without any seams at all. If you look closely at the picture above, you can see the borders around each rectangular module.\nThe Google X group has apparently managed to poach some engineers from Samsung and Qualcomm, but the report describes the team as \"small.\" Large-format displays are typically used for stadium jumbotrons, digital billboards, and video walls. It's not known what Google would want to do with large-format display technology or who its potential customers might be, but those are all typical questions for anything coming out of Google's mysterious skunkworks.\n", "deleted" : false }

One of those execs is Mac Delaney, who served as SVP of programmatic for Starcom Mediavest (SMG) before becoming Merkle’s VP and head of programmatic.\nDelaney spoke with AdExchanger about his transition and the changing face of the agency holding company.\nAdExchanger: Why did you move to Merkle?\nMAC DELANEY: The future agency model has DNA that doesn’t currently exist in today’s agency world. A big part of it is understanding audience segmentation, going all the way back to direct mail. I would extend that further and say, the future agency model is capable of handling your entire customer database.  I always tried to work [in disruptive areas] in my career: Federated Media/John Batelle was kind of the precursor to native. I was early in at Yahoo when we built the performance division. This move was a bet I saw other agency [executives] like Gerry Bavaro [who  moved to Merkle  from Omnicom’s Resolution Media] making.\nAnd the media component?\nOn top of database knowledge, you’d have an expertise in systems integration, and be able to consult with a marketer on how you understand audiences across different platforms and environments, and help them discover and learn more about their customers. You’d have key tactical components like social, SEO, email, display and programmatic, specifically. The last piece [is] where traditional agencies are holding on – you’d be able to buy tonnage of media based on relationships that you have, which help you negotiate.\nWhich is harder? The media or the systems integration part?\nThe hardest thing to do is to be the systems integrator. You look around the marketplace and see why agencies are encroaching on one another. The consultant firms have systems integration, but don’t have marketing or media buying experience per se, or database management to link it all together.\nAnd then you have companies like Merkle. Although we’re in a category with Acxiom and Epsilon, we [can] activate audience segments and bring them into the marketing environment and optimize creative because of our acquisitions over the last 10 years.\nMerkle’s history is as a CRM/database agency, but has moved aggressively into media and programmatic. Is this symptomatic of all the recent ad/mar tech mergers?\nOur value prop is marrying old-school data management and marketing with new sources of data. And you see that through [Merkle’s] acquisitions and integrations.\nIn order to talk about addressable marketing beyond the cookie, you need to marry foundational data management with how things are activated in the cookie-based and post-cookie world. You have some holding companies saying, “Our CRM databases are now plugged into Facebook,” but beyond the press release, when a client asks how it works, you need agencies who speak that vernacular and Merkle is one of the companies doing that.\nWhat do you make of all these agency holding companies investing in tech?\nOwning technology is incredibly hard. If you’re Google, Yahoo, AOL, technically both media and bona fide tech [companies], it can be done. But ensuring that technology stack is on the bleeding edge compared to its competition is incredibly hard. So is integration. Every single company that’s made acquisitions to build a complete stack has that challenge. Google did in launching DBM (DoubleClick Bid Manager) and it took a good, long while to integrate Teracent and analytics and Invite Media. Adobe, the same.\nThe moment a company from outside that category, such as an agency, acquires technology, the clock starts ticking around how long will it take for that feature/capability/algorithm to be antiquated. The agency has to be very careful about what it buys versus what it builds or partners for. SMG buying a future-forward DMP and DSP [like RUN] – it has to be very surgical and make good, financial sense.\nIf you’re a client, you expect your agency to buy technology. I don’t know if that is a DSP for $500 million, but I do believe you need to understand the data management component. If you’re a client today and your agency hasn’t made an investment anywhere, you’d be wondering why and what’s taking so long.\nMerkle was an early partner for Facebook’s and Google’s cross-device tools. How do you broach the issue of data ownership with clients?\nMerkle is drawing a distinction between addressable and non-addressable marketing. When you leverage cookies, there will be an inherent imperfection. But given your ability to decide what percentage of your mix will be based on second- and third-party data, you could still make the “first” generation of addressable back out for you. This is where Merkle sees a lot of opportunity – linking the addressable, known customer database to, “We need to build audience segments based on ‘X’ five signals.”\nBeginning now, with Google launching Customer Match, and Facebook with Atlas, those are giant, addressable one-to-one solutions, which will change the role of the agency. … [T]he complexities that arise from walled gardens underscore the need to have an unbiased, unconflicted partner in an agency who can help manage all of that. There is no smoke and mirrors when buying audiences in the digital world as there were five years ago.\nThe interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n", "deleted" : false }

Educomp had acquired Wizlearn (previously Asknlearn) for $7 million in 2007 in cash and options at that time and later transferred the stake from Educomp Asia Pacific to Educomp Intelliprop Ventures for $9 million.\nEducomp states that it made a 57% return on its original investment and that it will use the money to its debt to Axis Bank. The company said that the sale included its associated subsidiaries Singapore Learning, Pave Education and Wiz Learn (e-learning solutions company).\nSale of Gateforum Educational Services stake\nIn August last year, Educomp Solutions-owned Educomp Online Supplemental Services sold its majority shareholding in Gateforum Educational Services to ASK Pravi Private Equity Opportunities Fund for an undisclosed amount. ASK Pravi Capital said they would look to leverage Gateforum’s GATE preparation platform and scale it to other test preparation spaces.\nIndiaCan stake sale\nIn 2013, Educomp sold 50% of its stake in IndiaCan, a vocational training business to Pearson, its joint venture (JV) partner in the venture. The JV IndiaCan was started between Educomp and Pearson in 2009 to tap on the vocational training market in India. Educomp stated that this move was part of their “consolidation strategy”, a third in a series of exits from non-core businesses. The company said that this stake sale was made to avoid the need to fund losses and other capital needs of a non-core business.\nEducomp subsidiary Authorgen raised Rs 22 crore\nIn the same year, Authorgen , a subsidiary of Educomp Solutions, raised Rs 22 crore from Private Equity firm Kaizen and Bertelsmann , a German media company. Authorgen operated WizIQ.com , a web based platform for education services providers that enables them to create virtual Classroom and Convert document to flash.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2011, Educomp Solutions received the approval of its shareholders to transfer the domain and the business associated with the StudyPlaces.com business to its wholly owned subsidiary Educomp Software Limited. The business being transferred would cover the domain name studyplaces.com, its “business contracts along with all the employees, assets liabilities including all licenses, permits, consents and approvals whatsoever as a going concern” based on the book value as on 31st March 2011.\nAcquisition of Studyplaces\nIn 2010, Educomp had acquired and merged Studyplaces with a maximum consideration of $1.5 million dollars, as a preferential share allotment. Info Edge, which had invested $1 million in the company along with $1 million each from Kleiner Perkins, Caulfield & Byers (KPCB), Sherpalo Ventures had reported that they had lost money on the deal. At that time, Livemint had reported that Educomp planned to sell its entire 50% stake in Eurokids International Ltd, which runs pre-schools and publishes children’s book.\nCheck out our education coverage here .\nImage Credit: Flickr user  opensource.com\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Instead, it means finally hunkering down on a big idea and hoping it sticks. And when it does, you and your founding team are in for a real whirlwind of a ride. Just ask OfficeLuv, Chicago’s tech-enabled office management and maintenance startup who launched just last year and has already skyrocketed to about 50 employees. Take note, future founders.\nResponses from CEO and co-founder Chris Hartman.\nDay 1\nWhen Kathryn (co-founder of OfficeLuv) and I first started OfficeLuv we were just two people in one room, figuring things out. Despite frequent struggles, we both remained strong and resilient to push forward. In the earliest days of a startup I believe it is necessary to have resiliency and to some extent stubbornness. If you accept no as an answer and shut down, your dream and goal of building something great does, too. You will get many nos before a yes, so prepare yourself at this stage to accept that and push on.\nMonth 1\nCreate and reiterate with speed and intent. Start with your concept and move, and move quickly. The constant feedback loop from potential and current customers is essential. Try to build something that consumers or businesses will pay for but keep in mind that you're building for scale — you do not need to create, build or implement every feature requested or suggested. It is okay to say you do not offer something so long as your core product adds value or serves a purpose. Overexpanding your team, product or technology at this stage can prove to be a huge setback in future months. Be diligent at this stage: ask for feedback, ask for suggestions.\nYear 1\nStructure scales. As we are approaching our one year anniversary, we are beginning to expand our product and service offering beyond our core. Our team is now 48 employees strong and growing. Our attention and investment in our infrastructure, processes and personnel is paying off tremendously. Our ability to scale significantly in 2016 will be a direct outcome of our planning and iterations over the last 11 months. While we have our heads down working toward our next milestone, we also realize it is great to stop and smell the roses. We've come a long way in just a year and we're so proud of what we've been able to accomplish as a team.\n \n", "deleted" : false }

The technology was good for delivering real-time advertisements inside of video games such as those made for the PlayStation 3.\nThe deal shows just how much the game advertising business has changed in the past six years.\nBack in 2008, IGA Worldwide had 70 employees , and it was reaching 30 million gamers on the PC, Mac, Flash games, and the PlayStation 3. But then brand advertising moved into social games on Facebook and on mobile.\nBy the end of 2011, the New York company had fallen on hard times and was laying off employees. IGA had developed a technology, dubbed the Radial Network, which enables brands and advertisers to reach gamers playing triple-A console, computer, and mobile video games. Ads are streamed in real-time inside of a game’s 3D environment onto objects such as billboards, hoardings, buses, and posters. IGA could slap ads on any object in a virtual world where a gamer was likely to see an advertisement.\nThe Vancouver-based RapidFire is acquiring Radial Network ad servers and software development kits, and it will replace the preexisting RapidFire in-game ad serving tech.

XAware plans to use the money to finance its switch to an open-source business model in which the company will make its software available at no cost and generate revenue by offering service and support to users, said Tim Harvey, XAware’s chief executive. The investment by vSpring Capital, Sequel Venture Partners, ITU Ventures Inc., BMJP LLC and GMT Capital Corp. is the most money secured by a Colorado Springs company since Accellos Inc. scored $20 million in October 2006. XAware last raised $3.35 million in 2006. “Integration has been, is today and will continue to be one of the biggest problems in information technology,” said Ed Ekstrom, vSpring’s managing partner. “We believe open source and data integration represent a tremendous opportunity, and XAware is well positioned to become the market leader.” Atlanta-based hedge fund GMT is a new investor in XAware; the other four investors have previously combined to pump nearly $18 million into the company since 2002. Venture investors own a majority of XAware; the rest is held by management and employees. “The open-source model gives us a way to reach thousands of customers we couldn’t have afforded to reach any other way,” Harvey said. “We want to get as many people as possible using the software so they can come back and buy service and support from us.” XAware moved in November to the open-source model for its data integration software, a strategy the company had been developing since early 2007. As a result, about half of its 25 local employees went to work for customers or became independent developers, Harvey said. The latest investment should be the last the company needs until it becomes profitable and can support itself, Harvey said. While he declined to speculate how long that would take, he said the investment “certainly gives us several years worth of runway.” More than 60,000 users have downloaded a free version of XAware’s software at www.xaware.org during the past two months, which Harvey said is a promising start for the new strategy, which also has been used by Red Hat Inc. for the Linux computer operating system. “More and more of this kind of middle-ware is bought and not sold; companies want to try it before they buy it,” Harvey said. The additional funding will be used to promote the free version of XAware’s software and add features and functions to it, he said.

Fundamentally changing the way songwriters and artists get paid.\n2015-01-29 14:53\nNEW YORK, Jan. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- QTRAX, the free and legal digital music service, announced today a wide ranging plan to compensate songwriters and artists (\"artists\") in a more lucrative and representative manner. The details are available in an extensive, detailed report commissioned by Qtrax and authored by one of the Big Four accounting firms.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150129/172176\nThe Artist Manifesto (see on www.qtrax.com ) is effectively an Artist Bill of Rights with a sweeping set of initiatives that provide artists with far more input and compensates them fairly and respectfully. The key initiative is the awarding to artists of the equivalent of a 30% equity stake. This equity allocation is being enshrined in a legal entity called the Artist Trust to be administered independently by a Rights Organization, currently being selected.\nArtists will share in the profits of Qtrax and benefit from any liquidity event such as an IPO or trade sale, in precisely the same way other stakeholders accrue wealth.\nThe 30% Equity allocation will be divested over a 10 year period to artists based on the number of plays.\n\"Equity is the only real pot of gold from any of these digital music services, including our own. Artists are being shamefully compensated with ridiculously meager distributions while the value of some digital music services escalates to multi-billion amounts. Without the creative work of artists there can be no music services. None. An obvious fact but one that is not respected in the current economic structure. It's not a question of laying blame. Perhaps it can't be correctly attributed. But no amount of congressional pondering is going to alter the rates significantly enough. The base is so low that even a handsome percentage increase will not be good enough. Record companies were wise enough to request equity from music services. The songwriters and artists were not appropriately organized to do so. It's time they became owners of these services rather than exploited providers of content. We invite all digital services, existing & in the future, to similarly contribute equity to the Artist Trust to be run entirely for the benefit of Artists under an esteemed Board of music industry leaders. Distribution of proceeds from equity post-IPO will provide substantial income to artists and songwriters\" said Allan Klepfisz Founder and CEO of Qtrax.\n\"As QTRAX builds towards a liquidity event over the next 2-3 years money can be contributed into the Artist Trust in the form of advertising and sponsorship dollars by brands that believe in the power of music to connect with young consumers\" said Lance Ford President and CMO of Qtrax.\nABOUT QTRAX:\nQTRAX ( www.qtrax.com ) is a unique and emerging player in the digital music industry that will be launching its newly upgraded \"Free and Legal Music Service\" in Q1, 2015. Qtrax is available in 68 countries.\nFor more information:\n", "deleted" : false }

The site is currently inaccessible, and according to a comment left by Ton Walter on our old review of the app, the site has been down for three weeks now.\nIf you’re a WorkflowPerfect user frustrated by its seeming demise, I’ve gathered together a few potential alternatives:\nAdvertisement\nProcessMaker\nProcessMaker : If the business process management (BPM) features of WorkflowPerfect were what drew you to the app, check out ProcessMaker. It’s an open-source BPM tool that offers more powerful features than WorkflowPerfect, such as process mapping, a form builder, business rules and LDAP synchronization. Two editions are offered: the free Community Edition, and an Enterprise Edition with a greater range of features.\ncalc{list} With Passive Automation : This oddly named app is a CRM tool. It combines a contact manager, email system and company-wide workflow automation tool. Three editions are available, but for the Passive Automation features, you need to get the Pro edition, which costs $495. A 30-day free trial is available.\nProWorkFlow\nProWorkFlow : ProWorkFlow is an easy-to-use project management, workflow and time tracking solution for small to medium businesses. Plans start at £10 ($15 USD) per user per month. A free trial is available.\n5pm : If the task management — rather than BPM –aspects of WorkflowPerfect were why you were using the tool, you might like to check out 5pm. It’s an intuitive, easy-to-use project management app (see Jason’s review here ). Plans start at $18 per month, and a free trial is available.\nLiquidPlanner : If 5pm is too simplistic for your project management needs, another app that’s worth considering is LiquidPlanner; Mike sang its praises in his review . It has dynamic scheduling, Gantt charts, estimation, time tracking and analysis features. LiquidPlanner plans start at $25 per user per month, and a free trial is available.\nAdvertisement\nUnfortunately, none of the suggestions I’ve listed above are exact like-for-like replacements for WorkflowPerfect, but hopefully one of them will have the sort of functionality that you’re looking for.\nAdvertisement\nOne lesson to take from the disappearance of WorkflowPerfect is that if a web app has no obvious business model or means of generating revenue — WorkflowPerfect was only supported by Google ads on the site — there’s a greater risk it could disappear without warning. While most of the apps listed above are more expensive than the free WorkflowPerfect, they’ll hopefully have a better chance of staying the course.\nAdvertisement\nList your WorkflowPerfect alternatives below.\nAdvertisement\nRelated GigaOM Pro content (sub. req.): Report: The Real-Time Enterprise\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

While Microsoft has traditionally uses Windows Update to deliver OS and some application updates from a single source, the  latest leaked build of Windows 10 reveals that the company is moving towards P2P. A new option allows Windows 10 users to enable \"updates from more than one place,\" with the ability to download apps and OS updates from multiple sources to obtain them more quickly.\nCrowdsourcing updates\nApps and OS updates can be downloaded from Microsoft and PCs on a local network, or a combination of local PCs, internet PCs, and Microsoft’s traditional Windows Update servers. It’s no surprise that Microsoft is moving towards this distribution model. The software maker  acquired Pando Networks in 2013, the maker of a peer-to-peer file sharing technology that’s similar to BitTorrent. It’s not clear what technology Microsoft is using for its Windows 10 testing, but it’s reasonable to expect it has evolved from the Pando Networks acquisition.\nMicrosoft has not yet officially announced its P2P plans, but the company is planning to release an official Windows 10 preview shortly that will likely include the new changes. While Microsoft’s changes could prompt security concerns over the validity of OS updates, it’s likely that the company has built in methods to prevent tampering and a means to verify update packages before they’re applied to Windows 10 systems.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with Windows 10\n", "deleted" : false }

Today, that application is going live on the App Store for everyone to try for themselves.\nLed by CEO  Javier Soltero , previously a CTO at VMware and CEO and co-founder at Hyperic, and joined by former VMWare and Yahoo engineers   J.J. Zhuang  (CTO) and  Kevin Henrikson  (VP of Engineering), Acompli aims to solve some of the still significant pain points involved with using email on our smartphones today.\nThat is, typing on small screens is challenging, locating files and emails and contacts can be difficult, and switching between email and other productivity apps, like your calendar, is also hard.\nFor these reasons, a lot of email usage on mobile is limited to sending out short replies, while leaving the more complex tasks – like determining your availability for a meeting, or locating and attaching a file – for when you’ve returned to your desktop or laptop computer.\nAcompli, however, offers a different option by combining email and calendaring in one app, while also making it easier to locate anything, including older messages, people or files.\nIntegrated Calendar\nTo do so, its email app has been designed with a calendar button at the bottom, allowing you to look at your schedule at any time. And more importantly, it offers a calendar icon in the email “Compose” screen that, when tapped, opens up your calendar to display your availability. You can then tap a few times that work for you and those are dropped into the Acompli email message.\nIn addition, you can create meeting invites from the app by tapping on the time in the calendar, adding details like location and time, then sharing it with recipients who will see it as a calendar invite. And if you’re running late to a meeting, you can just tap the event and then the small arrow next to the organizer’s name to send a quick “I’m running late” note and your location.\nFinding Files And More\nThe app also keeps track of all the files you’ve been sharing via email for easy attachment to new messages, instead of forcing you to dig back through your message history to find the thread with the file attached (and then, often, having to clear out the text in that message so the new recipient doesn’t see the prior communication.) This feature is activated easily – you just tap the standard paperclip icon, which of course, also allows you to attach photos from your Camera or photo gallery, too.\nAcompli’s search feature is also powerful, with automatic suggestions that appear as you type, keyword highlighting, folder labels that show you where a message can be found, and a way to search for files – even filtering to show only “slides,” “images” or “docs” to help you narrow searches. The people search feature, meanwhile, is also a handy way to get caught up on your history with that contact, showing you prior emails, files shared, and meetings you attended together.\nWhile much of the app’s differentiated feature set is focused on what you can do beyond email, its email interface is fairly robust too. One thing that I especially like are the filters that let you switch between unread mail, flagged mail, and those with files. In iOS’s default Mail app, you can tap into your folder list to view flagged mail, but that’s it.\nWhile some of Acompli’s features are today found in a number of competing apps, including Gusto , CloudMagic , Tipbit and others, Acompli’s look-and-feel and feature set help it stand out. But the app is not perfect – the font is smaller than the iOS Mail app, with things like the sender and subject line shaded differently, which can make things a bit harder to read. It’s always jarring to try to switch to a new email app, so things that don’t necessarily have to change perhaps should not be touched.\nBut overall, Acompli is far more usable as an actual email application than those email apps built mainly for triage, including Mailbox.\n", "deleted" : false }

Previously, a small but visible text block that read “Google Site Stats” automatically appeared on the page where the conversion tracking code was placed on your web site. The logo would appear only after a conversion occurred via your AdWords ad, and it provided converting visitors links to information about AdWords conversion tracking and instructions on how to block the tracking.\nThis was obviously a huge pain point for advertisers. Yes, we want to track their conversions with AdWords and take advantage of all of the benefits and tools the platform provided, but showing that logo to site visitors was red flag to privacy worriers. I’m sure it was a great piece of branding for Google and that they’re sorry to see it go. My rep once explained to me that because Google was tracking user actions, they felt it was important to let users know that for their own security. However, in the post, Google also notes to “please inform users about the tracking methods you employ on your site by modifying your site’s privacy policy.” if you take down the logo.\nHmmm… Out of my own curiosity, I wonder what finally happened that got this change pushed through?\nYahoo Search Marketing: Yahoo’s top 5 frequently asked questions\nAt the Yahoo!

He also will be working with Executive Director Paula Hunter to seek additional sponsors for the Foundation besides Microsoft, he said.\n\"Some foundations, historically, are very project-centric,\" Walli said, citing the Apache Foundation as an example. \"Others are more business-centric, like the Linux Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation.\" But the CodePlex Foundation is designed to be technology- and licensing-agnostic, Walli said.\nMicrosoft announced the creation of the CodePlex Foundation last September , with a mission of increasing the participation of commercial-source vendors in the open-source world. In a recent interview with TechFlash, Hunter noted that one of the primary reasons Microsoft decided to create and fund the CodePlex Foundation was \"to reduce the barriers to their employees in being able to participate in open-source projects.\"\nThe Foundation is administering a handful of projects already, including the CoApp open-source package-management system and the Orchard content management system , both developed by Microsoft employees.\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

Maybe\n \n \n \nOn a day of endless polling , here's one that you might find even more interesting than all the political postulating. Well, maybe not, but it's probably worth noting anyways...\nIn case you missed it, the National Cyber Security Alliance ( NCSA ), a consumer security collaborative spanning the non-profit, academic, government and industry sectors, published a pretty remarkable study about Americans' perception of cybercrime.\nAccording to the report, which the oft-referenced Zogby recently conducted online with over 3,000 U.S. residents, Americans may in fact finally be adjusting their computing habits based on their knowledge of hacks, cracks and malware attacks.\nAnd let's face it, beyond selling people technologies that help protect them from attack this has been the elephant in the room with IT security, that is, raising consumer awareness, specifically in regards to the Web world.\nBased on Zogby's poll, \"nearly 60 percent of Americans say that the risks of identity theft have changed their online behaviors,\" NCSA claims.\nAdditionally, over 40 percent of those polled reported that they only visit familiar Web sites , and another 20 percent said they've curtailed their e-commerce buying based on their cyber-security concerns.\nThis is pretty cool, though, too bad about the e-commerce thing, but really that has to be expected as much as the credit card industry has stepped up to eat a lot of the losses. For the biggest fear among consumers remains identity theft -- and apparently not without good reason.\nAccording to the poll, a remarkable 22 percent of those surveyed said that they have had their \"identity misused\" to compromise a bank account, steal a credit card number or take out an unauthorized loan.\nI mean, that's over 600 people among 3,000, which is a pretty staggeringly high proportion.\nBut, I guess it proves out the fact that many people will only learn by enduring cybercrime hardships on their own.\nIn general, over 73 percent of those surveyed said they regularly use the Net to bank, trade stocks or review personal medical information. So, risks would appear to remain pretty high, even as many people have become more security aware.\nOn the downside, some 53 percent of those polled said that they use the same password for multiple services. Bad call there.\nAnd here's one result that I can't figure out at all, when those polled were asked if having their bank account or credit card account robbed of $5,000 was worse than having their home broken into and robbed of $5,000, 51 percent said that online fraud was worse.\nWhat's more, only 37 percent said that they considered the physical breach more unnerving than the cyber attack, with 12 percent unsure.\nNow, I don't know about you, but I'd sure rather have my identity stolen than have someone invade the confines of my physical residence, but, I suppose it does add to the theory that people are putting more weight on issues of cyber security.\n\"The convenience of conducting part of our lives online has transformed the way we live, but it's not without risk,\" Michael Kaiser, executive director of the NCSA, said in a report summary. \"Only visiting Web sites that you trust is one aspect of good online security. In addition, home users should be vigilant about keeping their anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall up-to-date and use unique passwords that contain numbers, letters and symbols. These tools combined with good online behavior equal good cyber security.\"\nMatt Hines has been following the IT industry for over a decade as a reporter and blogger, and has been specifically focused on the security space since 2003, including a previous stint writing for eWeek and contributing to the Security Watch blog.

I was curious how his service works and how it's different from other dating sites. Here's my interview with Alexei. Please comment with your questions for Alexei. - Mark Brooks\nWhat is Anastasia ?\nIt's the fastest way to meet Russian women via the internet. It's an online dating website that allows people from Russia, North America, Europe and other parts of the world to connect and correspond with each other. People from different countries can write letters to each other in their native language and the letters are delivered and translated. We have a network of over 200 agents in the former Soviet Union who make sure the messages get delivered.\nWho are your target customers?\nMost of our male customers are based in the U.S. or Canada. We also have some male customers from the EU, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. We have female customers from all over the former USSR. We have slightly more women on the site then men, which is actually a part of why the site is successful. We currently have more than 10,000 active women profiles on AnastasiaWeb ; however our overall database is much larger. We only display the profiles of women who are actively using the site.\nWe don't allow every applicant to become a member. We verify profiles and personal information and allow only those individuals that pass the verification process. We do everything we can to protect our customers.\nWhat is the age range?\nWe don't allow men or women under 18 and I would say that the average female age would be about 24 or 25 years old. So these are rather young women. The male audience is older in general. The average age would be between 34 and 40, in that range. In Russia and Ukraine it's very common that women date and marry men that are older.\nWhat's AnastasiaWeb's founding story?\nWe were founded in 1993 by a Russian/American couple, Elena and David Besuden. Elena and David met through an introduction service in 1992 and were married the same year. Initially, Anastasia used catalogs to introduce profiles to men in the US. This format was used at first, because the internet wasn't so well developed. The first AW web site was launched on Jan 21, 1997. Also, in 1997, Anastasia International formed a partnership with IT Online, to handle its business operations in Russia and the CIS. There are now more than 90 employees working in the US and Russian offices, handling web development, maintenance, marketing, customer service, verification and other administrative services.  Elena and David grasped the idea of online dating rather early and succeeded.\nHow do you make money?\nWe make money on the correspondence. Each letter being delivered is translated. Most of the women do not have a computer or regular access to the Internet, so we formed a network of agents that could deliver and translate messages. We charge for a letter but we actually provide more than just a delivery service. We provide additional services that go along with the letter itself. One of the services is a direct telephone communication service, which allows clients to speak to each other with the help of a professional translator. It's like a conference call. Women don't pay at all. The cheapest correspondence service level is $3.99 per letter and the most is $8, but membership to the site is free. They can use a lot of other additional free services.\nHow do you protect the users from potential scammers?\nThere are many companies who used to say, \"We don't have fraud. We're fighting fraud and 100% scam free.\" We can't say that, we are not 100% fraud free. But we realize the problems and we make every single effort to protect our customers. We have initiated a fraud fighting campaign and have invested heavily on investigation, protection and different ways of tracking fraud. We can protect the correspondence; we can make sure that the message is delivered and that it is translated in the proper way.\nA women coming to an agency provides her personal ID that will be scanned and entered into the database. We verify that she's not under age and we also verify that she's not married. We verify information about her kids and other information. Then the agency will estimate the language ability of the women. It's a rough estimate but we like to provide this information to our members. The agency tries to verify that the photograph is definitely her photograph and that it's not an outdated photograph.  Then they enter her profile on the AnastasiaWeb site. Our verification agents in the Moscow office will call her within three days. They will review all the information. We have a call center that is devoted to calling the women and further verifying that they're legitimate clients. They will verify identity, ask if the woman wants to participate, and verify other important information. The profile is then considered a checked profile and will be activated when our system updates in two or three days. \nWhat are your goals for AnastasiaWeb for 2006 through 2007? What kind of partnerships are you seeking?\nOne of our goals over the next year is to expand our \"offline\" activities. To provide more organized opportunities for members to meet in-person. Regarding partners, we are looking for companies that provide great traffic. We have a good affiliate program with hundreds of affiliates. We are looking to expand that. We're also interested in speaking with other western online dating companies that would like access to our large database of verified profiles from throughout the former Soviet Union. Finally, we're looking to cooperate with companies that have know-how with mobile communications and video.  Mobile phone dating will be a benefit for our customers, because it should speed-up the communications process. We want to take every step possible to help our clients really find someone special.\nSep 15, 2006 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

A rumor was circulating last week that Microsoft was sniffing around SecondLife vendor Linden Lab . I have no idea why Microsoft would want Linden Lab, but the Softies are definitely trying to expand their gaming presence to incorporate hardware and games that will appeal to more than just hard-core gamers.\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

Sourcery will be exhibiting at booth 8424K in Startup Alley which is being held at McCormick Place from May 21-24, 2016. Startup Alley was created by the NRA to showcase companies that are thinking outside the box, with technologies not normally used in the restaurant industry.\nSourcery Payments is a seamless interface to help restaurants, commercial kitchens, food retailers, and restaurant accounting firms digitally manage invoicing and payments with advanced dashboard insights for real-time spend monitoring and improved cash flow management.\n“By essentially taking over this part of the operation, we’re enabling our customers to focus on what they really love: cooking delicious meals and delivering outstanding customer experiences,” says Sourcery’s CEO Na’ama Moran. “Restaurant owners are really passionate about food, but they really don’t like to manage cash flows. That’s what Sourcery does so well, and why we’ve been selected to exhibit.”\nSourcery’s integrations with most accounting software– including QuickBooks, Dynamics GP, Intacct, Netsuite, Sage and Xero – as well as partnerships with Restaurant365, Heartland Payment Systems, Revel POS, and restaurant management systems throughout the industry, allow Sourcery to streamline restaurants’ day-to-day back office activities – freeing them up to focus on their employees, customers, and their passion – serving great food.\nSourcery has already built an impressive list of users. Some of the leading tech companies with their own kitchens, like Palantir, Dropbox, and Airbnb, are all Sourcery users. Popular restaurants like Elephants Deli, Snap Kitchen, Eastman Egg, Bracco World Café, Pizza Hacker, and Nerai also rely on Sourcery.\nIn fact, some of the biggest venture capitalists are already taking note of Sourcery’s huge growth potential. Palantir’s cofounder Joe Lonsdale, Yammer CTO Adam Pisoni, and ex-Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein are all part of the investor group.\n“Sourcery is solving a real business problem in a highly focused and underserved vertical with massive potential for network effects,” Lonsdale said in a statement.\nSourcery has developed the next generation Accounts Payable Platform for restaurants, caterers and corporate kitchens of all sizes.

She has a PR degree and she describes herself as a Social Media addict, fashion and iPhone lover. Contact her on Twitter!\nWith an international footprint and highly-skilled professionals, Making Sense has focused on bringing our client’s ideas to life providing the best User Experience possible. Whether we’re developing a revolutionary app or developing a game, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve the user, rather than our own company goal.\nWe always take projects or products as if they were our own. By listening to our clients, we identify solutions that meet their needs and find the right professionals for the team. This was the case of COPsync , which operates United States’s largest law enforcement real-time, in-car information sharing, communication and data interoperability network.\nAs the testimonial video shows, COPsync needed to develop industry’s first high-definition software driven video system for law enforcement patrol cars. The software-driven system needed to use the power of existing in-car computers and to eliminate the need for a separate DVR (digital video recorder).\nHands in Action!\nAs a creative company that likes to take on new challenges, Making Sense was excited to be part of a highly complex software development project. COPSync runs a lean operation and has a small development staff. For this reason it developed a very close-knit partnership with Making Sense, who acted as their “in-house” outsourced development team.\nWith a bilingual force of professionals taking advantages of flexible/manageable schedule that adapted to the partner Making Sense Created VidTac , an in-car video system for law enforcement. This system offers true High Definition 1080p video, which is double the image quality of current High Definition systems. It is also the only system in the law enforcement in-car video market that simultaneously captures both full-motion HD video and high-resolution five megapixel still images. At 1080p, it records more than 10 times the image detail of standard resolution analog cameras.\nThe benefits behind VidTac\nMaking Sense definitely took a unique software approach with VidTac . It turned the existing in-car computer into a DVR without interrupting other programs. That is in contrast to other camera systems, which require a costly DVR for all video recording, processing, and storage.\nWith the help and hard work of Making Sense’s developers the software-driven system was able to use the power of existing in-car computers and eliminated the need for a separate DVR (digital video recorder). They also designed an ultra-compact twin-lens camera system which not only doubled the image resolution quality, but also the effective visual range of both video and still images.\nAfter developing VidTac , COPsync was able to offer clients an application with the following features:\nOn-board GPS and accelerometer, built-in location tracking and crash detection, and configurable backup memory.\nAn evidence file size control feature that allows the volume of data stored to be adjusted by dialing down the data rate and blending video with high-quality still images.\nVidTac’s redundancy records and stores more than 100 hours of evidentiary video, depending on the selected data rate.\nUX at the core of everything we develop!\nIn an recent interview with Making Sense , Herbert Severin, VP Strategic Innovation explained “There were a lot of business challenges to producing VidTac, our law enforcement video system. We needed to get to the market quickly, we needed to do sufficient market testing, and we needed creativity. And continued “We also needed to have a very unique User Experience. We were doing it differently than anybody was doing it that was using a PC which opens up flexibility from a priority box and that is expertise that Making Sense brought us.”\nAs COPsync VP explained, they needed a software development company that offered creativity, technical expertise and a commitment to service that matched their own commitment to their customers. They needed to partner with a company that offered extensive, proven experience creating applications with an Excellent User Experience .\nSome of the main UX benefits offered by Making Sense include:\nEnthusiastic acceptance by end users\nHigher productivity and efficiency\nImprovements in user satisfaction\nThe success of this revolutionary app was such that it was featured in newspapers and TV channels from all over the world including CNN in the U.S, BBC in England , el País in Uruguay, and  La Nacion , which is is one of the most prestigious newspapers in Argentina.\nWe are your next strategic partner!\nAs a software development company with a team of highly qualified professionals Making Sense continues assisting companies to provide the best services to their clients in today’s competitive world.

The event, titled \"Garden of Hedonism,\" promised \"a night of total titillation that's both decadent and green,\" and that it would be held at--Johnny Utah's!?\nNew Yorkers who follow restaurant openings and closings are undoubtedly familiar with Johnny Utah's , an \"upscale-cowboy\" theme restaurant and bar across the street from Rockefeller Center. It's also home to one of only two mechanical bulls in Manhattan, and apparently, the rationale for holding a vaguely green-related party there is that the bull is solar-powered.\nAl Gore would be proud.\nUnfortunately, I didn't ride the bull; I had some reconnaissance to do because I still wasn't exactly sure what the event was all about. Ideal Bite, as I soon learned, is the newest offspring of Pilot Group, the on-the-down-low media investment group run by MTV co-founder and former AOL Chief Operating Officer Robert Pittman.\nPilot Group, as some better-informed attendees told me, currently has stakes of varying degrees in locally run e-mail newsletters DailyCandy and Thrillist , as well as music blog Stereogum . I also heard that there's a connection of sorts to elite social-networking site ASmallWorld .\nThis, of course, means that Ideal Bite is a well-moneyed start-up. As a result, the launch party featured an open bar with organic signature cocktails (like the \"Forbidden Apple,\" consisting of vodka, apple juice, lime juice, apple brandy, sparkling cider, and mint leaves), scantily clad dancers wearing faux fig leaves, and well-stuffed swag bags.\nThe crowd was very Midtownish, very BlackBerry-friendly, and suspiciously good-looking for a dot-com launch party--thirty-somethings, mostly, the men in suits and the women wearing outfits strategically assembled to bridge the gap between office life and nightlife.\nI ran into some of the folks behind Thrillist and DailyCandy--Thrillist co-founder Adam Rich reminded me that his start-up is having its own soiree later this week and asked, \"What's with all these parties suddenly happening all the time?\" Really, you'd swear it were, you know, Silicon Valley. Except we're cuter here.\nAlso around: Blip.tv co-founder Dina Kaplan, Flavorpill co-founder Mark Mangan, the team from events start-up SpongeCell --as well as two of the guys who run the Webby Awards , who have been very kind to CNET in the past.\nNot spotted: anyone from TreeHugger , which presumably offers a less sassy shade of green than Ideal Bite. (TreeHuggers, correct me if I'm wrong, and you actually were there.)\nOne male attendee eagerly pointed out a couple of Ideal Bite's female writers. \"They're hot!\" he whispered to me. \"I thought they'd be, like, crunchy!\"\nPittman was there, but he was naturally mobbed by guests all night. The person I really wanted to talk to was Jason Rapp, senior vice president of mergers and acquisitions at InterActiveCorp, whose company had just made a five-way split earlier that day. Rapp was receiving congratulations aplenty, perhaps for his company's candor in admitting to press and investors that its sprawling scope was a disadvantage.\nRapp was upbeat when I asked him how the outlook was for IAC. \"We're doing great! Did you see the stock prices?\" True, IAC shares did leap up a bit after Monday's announcement. Before I could grill him any further, someone else snagged him and presumably started asking the same questions.\nSo, the people were pretty, the conversation was good, and the drinks were free. The only problem, really, was the star attraction: the solar-powered bull. My only real familiarity with mechanical bull-equipped venues was when I was in Los Angeles in July for E3 , and attended a party at the Sunset Strip's pseudo-legendary Saddle Ranch Chop House . Let's just say the ferocity of the bull at Johnny Utah's paled in comparison to its West Coast counterpart, which I pointed out to an anonymous observer.\n\"What, do they want to f***ing break the spinal column of some senior vice president at AOL or something?\" He had a point.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

A year ago, Aurora's focus was biofuels , but now it intends to farm algae for pharmaceuticals, food, and animal feed.\nAmong the planned products are Omega-3 fatty acids for health supplements, protein for health shakes and protein bars, and fish meal. It still intends to harvest algae for biodiesel.\nThe company, which has raised $40 million from investors, is now operating a 20-acre demonstration facility in coastal Florida which uses brackish seawater. Rather than license its technology, it plans to produce algae and end products.\nAurora Algae's switch to emphasize food products reflects the difficulty of cracking into the liquid fuels business with biomass-derived fuels.

Those include movies like Seven Samurai, Break Morant, Blood Simple, and Mad Max. You can apparently expect the service to be advert-free, but it'll have a monthly premium.\nWord on the street is that FilmStruck will cost less than $9 a month. Pricing details have yet to be determined, however. Keep in mind that when the movie-streaming service does kick off later this year, likely in the autumn, Hulu fans may find that they no longer have access to some Warner/Criterion movies, as those could become FilmStruck exclusives.\nWe at Pocket-lint are huge Criterion Collection fans, so we're excited about the possibility of being able to easily stream those films in the US (it's unclear if FilmStruck will be available elsewhere, such as in the UK). But at the same time, the thought of shelling out more cash on yet another monthly streaming service is just blah.

Mark Riffee Business\nDate of Publication: 11.04.11.\nTime of Publication: 11:43 am.\n11:43 am\nNYSE Tries to Get on Same Social Media Page as #OWS\nWhile hundreds of protesters in Zuccotti Park were still asleep inside tents and improvised tarpaulin shelters early Friday morning, corporations were learning about hashtags and “following” at the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) first-ever social media day .\nNew Media Strategies , a social-media-marketing consultant with a résumé that includes work for Disney and the NFL Players Union, hosted the event. Their goal: teach the members of NYSE-traded corporations how to effectively interact with the web community.\nThe time and place seem appropriate — the New York Stock Exchange is just two and a half blocks from the epicenter of Occupy Wall Street , a movement that is perhaps better identified as #OWS .\n#OWS is essentially a worldwide metaphorical loogie in the face of the same big corporations that were invited to participate in the NYSE event today, and social media is providing the saliva .\nPete Snyder, founder and CEO of New Media Strategies, tells Wired.com that though the event has been in the works for months, the relevance to Occupy isn’t lost on anyone. “What Occupy Wall Street is saying is, ‘Hey Wall Street, you need to listen more to consumers and activists,'” says Snyder. “That’s step number one.”\nThe second step is to actively engage in the conversation that #OWS protesters have started. From there, corporations can learn how to please their customers, monitor the quality of their employees’ experiences, and observe the competition.\nSeems like a simple — and logical — enough undertaking, but corporations are often image-conscious and obdurate. They tend to create what they believe is a prestigious identity and then indiscriminately sell it to the public. The problem is, if there is no forum for communication, the marketing strategists for these corporations won’t know whether their methods strike customers and investors as pretentious or off-putting until sales dip. Snyder says NYSE-traded companies have to remember that the public owns them and the best way to ensure success is to interact as intimately as possible with the people footing the bills.\nA panel of social media experts, which included representatives from Morton’s Restaurant Group and Verizon, suggested ways to get in-touch with the web audience. Verizon’s goals, for instance, are to communicate with consumers through video and mobile networking, tweet rather than e-mail press releases, frame products and services in narratives that customers can relate to, and create cross-platform integration.\nPlenty of corporations, especially those in the entertainment and news industries, have already mastered these techniques. But many haven’t, whether because they lack tech-savvy personnel or because they’re afraid to jump into a well-established — and often critical — conversation. What they need to realize, Synder says, is that the conversation is going to happen with or without them. “Ninety-nine percent of people aren’t always going to love you,” he says. “But you can take control by participating in the give and take.”\nSnyder is hopeful that social media can be the middle ground on which #OWS protesters and their foes, out-of-touch “ major banks and multinational corporations ,” find compromise.\nIt’s a tall order, but if politicians and corporations fail to join the conversation, said keynote speaker Christine Varney, an antitrust lawyer who has worked in the Clinton and Obama administrations, “the people who are occupying Wall Street may take matters into their own hands.”\nPhoto: Mark Riffee\n", "deleted" : false }

Today, a well-known brick and mortar craft store, Michaels , is buying Chicago-based digital scrapbooking startup ScrapHD. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nScrapHD allows consumers to create digital scrapbooks online that can be printed wither at home or have bound into a professional, coffee-book style book. The site also offered the ability to create greetings cards and posters from photos. Now users will be able to use the service to print. Now users will soon be able to send their prints for pickup at their nearest Michaels store.\nMichaels says the scrapbook business is a $2 billion market, with the U.S. digital photo book market growing by nearly 60 percent over the past five years. The ScrapHD website will be closed during the transition, and will re-launch on Michaels.com with free content and paid memberships for access to premium content.\nThe fact that brick and mortar stores are trying to get into digital scrapbooking through acquisitions could be good news for smaller online scrapbooking sites, like Scrapblog, as the digital scrapbooking space is quite competitive with Flickr, Apple, Shutterfly all offering similar technologies to put user photos on digital books.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

The report covers the Americas, APAC, and EMEA; it also covers the market landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nThe increased demand for Li-ion batteries is driving manufacturers to develop next-generation technology batteries for electronic devices and vehicles. The Li-ion battery market is gradually shifting to high-energy silicon electrodes in place of conventional graphite ones. The new type of silicon electrode-based Li-ion batteries offer long-lasting energy for laptops and EVs. However, these batteries may also shrink and swell while in use or recharging, resulting in breakdown.\nAccording to the report, the cost of Li-ion batteries is decreasing rapidly owing to an increase in end-user application base. The cost of these batteries was four to eight times more than that of lead-acid batteries and one to four times more than Ni-MH batteries in 2010.\nHowever, the cost has decreased significantly since then, driven by the growing use of Li-ion batteries in BEVs, PHEVs, HEVs, uninterrupted power supply (UPS) systems, forklifts, consumer electronics devices, and backup power supplies. Manufacturers will increasingly be able to leverage economies of scale with growth in market size and production scales.\nKey vendors\n", "deleted" : false }

At the time of publication RIM had not responded to a request to name other organizations planning to pilot BB10.\nBack in October ICE announced it planned to end its long-standing relationship with RIM and switch its 17,600+ employees from BlackBerrys to iPhones  — saying BlackBerrys “can no longer meet the mobile technology needs of the agency” — so it would be a massive win for RIM if ICE ends up staying faithful. However it is not clear exactly what the agency plans at this point — whether it’s just kicking the tyres of RIM’s new platform to consider its options, or intending to use RIM”s device management software to manage a mixed estate of devices (including iPhones), or indeed considering buying all new BlackBerry 10 devices for its staff.\nAt the time of writing ICE was not available for comment.\nUpdate: An ICE spokeswoman told TechCrunch the agency is not backing away from either iOS or RIM. “Given the nature of a rapidly evolving marketplace for mobile computing and the rising expectations of our users for that technology, we see the need to maintain a set of services that base support ICE’s mission. The pilot with RIM is a prudent technology management practice,” she wrote in an email, adding: “ICE and RIM have had a long and good relationship, and we plan to continue that relationship.”\nAsked to clarify if this meant ICE might roll out a mixed estate of iPhones and BlackBerry 10 devices, or use RIM’s device management software to manage devices she said: “Again, we’re not backing away from either [iOS or RIM].”\n“ICE will be participating in a BlackBerry 10/BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 pilot as outlined in the press release. Timing for the pilot is approximately January 2013,” she added. “ICE is developing mobile applications for law enforcement, and ICE is looking into how BlackBerry 10 may be able to provide mobility solutions in the future.”\nRIM is very much in limbo at present — trying to keep its remaining customer base together and out of the arms of the iOS and Android-based competition while it transitions from its current generation BlackBerry OS to the next generation of the platform, BB10, with devices not due until the first quarter of next year. It’s also expending a lot of effort to get developers backing BB10 and building the apps it needs to ensure a healthy BB10 ecosystem.\nHaving a big government agency like ICE kick the tires of BB10 is exactly the sort of thing RIM needs to see and validates some of the moves it has been making.\nIn November the BlackBerry maker announced that BB10 had been granted FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 140-2 certification — which certifies the products for use by government agencies and regulated industries in the U.S. and Canada. It has also announced a program for existing enterprise customers to get ready for the switch to BB10 — offering one free device per company if they start preparing to adopt BB10.\nReuters notes that RIM’s shares have been surging in recent week — with another share rally on Wednesday. RIM’s shares are currently trading at 13.14, up from 11.60 last Thursday.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.\n\"As a part of our ongoing strategy to establish IBM GBS as a premier global digital consultancy and accelerate GBS leadership in the next generation cloud CRM solutions space, Microsoft solution implementations will increasingly require transformational consulting services based on unique client industry insight,\" said Peter Rousseau, associate partner in the IBM GBS U.K. public sector practice. \"IBM GBS has been successful in this area and needs to continue the expansion of its position with global reach, deep industry expertise, and industry-specific assets. Optevia's expertise and assets deliver this step change for IBM GBS.\"\nRousseau said Optevia primarily focuses on U.K. emergency services, central government, local government, health authorities and housing authorities. The company's client base includes ministries, councils, regulators, licensing and grant management organizations, transport authorities and social housing organizations.\n\"IBM has a strong presence in the U.K. public sector market and in key European public sector markets,\" Rousseau said. \"Public sector, as a market for IBM in Europe is a significant and important one.\"\nIBM estimates that the global CRM opportunity is in excess of $23 billion, with cloud-based CRM solutions expected to surpass 50 percent of that total.\n\"The worldwide Customer Relationship Management (CRM) market is continuing to expand with accelerated focus on cloud-based solutions,\" Rousseau said. \"The acquisition of Optevia is central to IBM GBS' strategy to establish a premier, global consultancy in next generation Microsoft CRM solutions.\"\nThe U.K. public sector is facing an unprecedented challenge in having to meet a rising demand for its services while facing the tightest financial squeeze in decades—and technology can play an unprecedented role in helping to meet this challenge, Optevia said in a white paper.\n\"One of the priorities is to make the back office more efficient, providing large savings in internal operations while raising the quality of service for internal and external customers,\" the white paper said. \"It requires a widespread transformation, and a customer relationship management (CRM) system can provide one of the foundations to make it possible. In this paper, we explore how a correspondence management system built on Dynamics CRM can expedite an organization's need to change and transform.\"\nMoreover, Rousseau said Optevia's strong reputation in the U.K. public sector will provide IBM with immediate access to a pool of specialty sales and delivery experts in the rapidly evolving cloud CRM space. Optevia will increase the GBS Dynamics practice in Europe. It also provides IBM with immediate access to \"differentiating code-based assets that are scalable into the broader Europe and North America regions—to help drive increased win rates and accelerated time to value for our clients,\" he said.\nThe Optevia deal should benefit IBM in three essential ways, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT.\n\"First, the company specializes in Microsoft Dynamics CRM solutions so it will provide IBM the means to both pursue new business with customers that prefer the Dynamics CRM platform and be more effective in going head to head with Microsoft in those deals,\" King said. \"Second, it specializes in solutions/services for public sector organizations, including government agencies, emergency services and transportation authorities, meaning it will complement IBM's longstanding efforts in public sector markets. Finally, Optevia has enjoyed solid success in the U.K., a key market for IBM that could also serve as a launching pad for other IBM efforts in the Euro zone. Overall, this looks like a solid deal that should benefit both companies and their existing and potential customers.\"\nIBM does not produce any commercial CRM solutions of its own, but the company partners with several key CRM vendors including SAP, Salesforce.com and SugarCRM , among others.\n\"We have a broad portfolio of CRM vendors we partner with and support,\" Rousseau said.\nAt its PartnerWorld Leadership Conference last month, IBM named SugarCRM as an IBM Beacon Award winner. SugarCRM won the award for its integrated \"IBM Marketing Cloud and SugarCRM\" solution.\n \n", "deleted" : false }

Devices that don't support any connectivity standard, such as an old refrigerator, can be added to the network via a Z-Wave adapter and then the user can monitor their energy usage and even turn them on or off.\nMost of the new appliances will come with a wireless standard for connectivity, however, and the Motorola Home Gateway supports all of these standards.\n", "deleted" : false }

The Nexo team continues to work on its product. The latest update is tight e-mail integration.

This is a handy feature, and if you're trying to increase participation in a group, it could help a lot.\nUnfortunately, not all features are enabled for two-way e-mail.

The agency has sent the regulations to the Office of Management and Budget, which will determine whether they comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act. If that goes according to plan, they'll get published on the Federal Register, making them official.\nAt the same time, the Commission is looking for candidates for its Open Internet Advisory Committee, tasked with \"tracking developments with respect to the freedom and openness of the Internet.\"\nWe're talking October—at the earliest—before these rules are finally enforceable. And once that happens, it's likely that Verizon and/or MetroPCS will once again ask a federal court to strike them down (three months ago a judge ruled the companies couldn't sue until the provisions were formally released). \nMeanwhile, at least a few people will doubtless cite the neutrality provisions to complain about ISP behavior. And we're betting that controversial restrictions on third-party tethering applications will come under some kind of scrutiny.\nIndeed, they already have. As we've reported , Free Press wants the FCC to take a close look at Google's move to curtail access (or, as Google puts it, making them \"unavailable for download\" via the Android Market) to independent 4G tethering apps. Those indie tethering downloads are a sweet deal; for the initial price of the software, they allow you to connect your mobile to your laptop and access the Internet. Similar apps from your ISP can cost as much as $30 a month.\nPlease see Google\nGoogle and the ISPs have formed a circular finger-pointing squad concerning this issue. The search engine giant says it is curtailing the technology in response to requests from wireless carriers. But when we asked Google's Droid partner Verizon for its version of the story, we got a \"see Google\" response. \"It's important to remember, Google manages what's available in the Android Market,\" a Verizon spokesperson told us.\nRegardless of where it started, Free Press says that this sort of behavior represents a violation of the C Block open device access rules that Verizon agreed to when it bought a huge chunk of 700MHz spectrum on the license area in question. \"Removing the applications from the Android Market curtails, restrains, and interferes with the ability of subscribers to use the applications of their choice by making it more difficult to download and install those applications,\" the reform group warns.\nVan Schewick\nNow a prominent professor of Internet architecture has written to the Commission , hastening to agree.\n\"Verizon Wireless's practice and Free Press's complaint raise fundamental issues of Internet openness policy,\" argues Barbara van Schewick , Associate Professor of Law and Engineering at Stanford University. \"Free Press's complaint implicates not only the specific question of whether Verizon Wireless has violated the conditions associated with its spectrum licenses, but also the more general question of how to apply openness rules to mobile networks.\"\nVan Schewick is the author of Internet Architecture and Innovation (MIT Press), and one of a group of scholars who complained to the FCC about Comcast's behavior in the 2008 BitTorrent case. Internet Architecture contends that the 'Net's design structure is changing in ways \"that deviate from the Internet's original design principles,\" removing features that encouraged innovation during the founding days of cyberspace. The alterations \"reduce the amount and quality of application innovation and limit users' ability to use the Internet as they see fit.\"\nAs in, for example, keeping inexpensive third-party tethering apps off the Google Android Market.\nApplication-agnostic discrimination\nThe complexity, of course, with defining the tethering app restriction problem as related to \"fundamental issues of Internet openness policy\" is that the FCC's open Internet rules exclude mobile wireless from its non-discrimination provisions (that's probably why the focus has been mostly on the C Block auction rules).\nBut Van Schewick's longer commentary to the Commission filed last year is worth a read, because at some point the FCC may have to deal with this tethering issue. Back in December, Van Schewick urged the FCC to adopt a non-discrimination rule that \"clearly bans application-specific discrimination (i.e. discrimination based on application or class of application)\" but would allow \"application-agnostic discrimination.\"\nVan Schewick explained the distinction as so:\nThus, a network provider would not be allowed to treat Vonage differently from Skype, or Comcast's Fancast differently from Hulu. That would be discrimination based on application. Nor would it be allowed to treat online video differently from e-mail. That would be discrimination based on class of application.\nBut:\nIt would be allowed to treat data packets differently based on criteria that have nothing to do with the application or class of application. For example, during times of congestion, a network provider could give one person a larger share of the available bandwidth than another, for example because this person pays more for Internet access or has used the Internet less over a certain period of time. But it could not throttle the bandwidth available to a specific online video application such as Hulu in particular, or online video in general. That would be application-specific discrimination.\nThe point of the rule would be to stop network providers from \"distorting the playing field\" between specific applications or classes of apps. At the same time, it would allow ISPs to use various network management tools to address congestion and other issues.\n\"Network providers would be able to enforce fairness among users, allocating bandwidth among users in application-agnostic ways, but how a user decides to use its 'share' of bandwidth, both in general and at a particular point in time would be decided by the user,\" van Schewick suggests.\nDiscrimination or blocking?\nThe FCC could conceivably deploy this concept on behalf of wired Internet users once it releases its net neutrality rules. But when it comes to third-party tethering apps, the question is whether such rules could be extended to wireless. The agency's  order  (PDF) makes the distinction between wired and wireless regulation clear (we've added the italics):\n\"Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.\"\n\"No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services.\"\nClearly the non-discrimination concept as outlined here wouldn't apply to downloadable third-party mobile tethering software. The next question is whether denying these apps a place on the Android Market could be construed as \"blocking.\" They are, after all, in competition with ISP-offered pay-to-tether services; but is keeping them off the Market a \"block\"?\nIt's yet another conundrum for the FCC to tackle, if it wants—though a good chunk of its attention will likely be spent first defending the legal basis of its net neutrality rules in court.\n", "deleted" : false }

The company won’t disclose much about what they’re doing, except that they’re building a Flash-based massively multiplayer online game ( MMOG ). And they certainly have the team to do it.\nSusan Wu , the founder and CEO, is a former principal at Charles River Ventures and the former CMO of the Apache Software Foundation, and has experience with MMOGs. She’s also a self-confessed World Of Warcraft addict. Her team includes Blake Commagere (CTO), a cofounder of Mogad (acquired by iSkoot); Don Neufeld (VP Engineering), the former technical director at Sony Online Entertainment where he shipped Everquest II, Planetside and 13 other products; and Scott Harsman (VP Production), the former executive producer and creative director at Sony Online Entertainment where he led development of Everquest II, Everquest and other projects.\nNeufeld and Harsman both worked at Sony Online Entertainment and brought a team with them. Wu says via email “There are very few teams that have shipped multiple MMOs across different generations of products. We are very fortunate to have Scott, Don and the team they brought over from Sony. There is a significant amount of learning that comes from having gone through dozens of MMO launches that we are applying to our products. Also, while at Sony, our team was involved in the design and implementation of their virtual goods platform.”\nThe company won’t yet give details on what type of game or platform they’re building, but they’ve convinced the venture capitalists that the idea and technology is sound. In the Fall of 2008 the company raised an undisclosed round of financing with August Capital and Rustic Canyon Partners, rumored to be in the $6 million range.\n", "deleted" : false }

(video)", "date" : { "$date" : "2011-02-26T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "URL" : "http://venturebeat.com/2011/02/26/will-microsoft-conquer-free-to-play-games-with-age-of-empires-online-video/", "content" : "Will Microsoft conquer free-to-play games with Age of Empires Online? (video)\nDean Takahashi\nTags: Age of Empires Online , real-time strategy\nAge of Empires has sold more than 25 million copies in retail stores over the years. So it was a big leap when Microsoft announced last August that it would recreate the game as an online-only free-to-play game. This week, it took the wraps off the game and we got a close look at it.\nIf this free-to-play version takes off, it will become Microsoft’s flagship entry in the new age of downloadable online video games, where upstarts such as Gameforge, Nexon, Outspark and Perfect World are the contenders for the throne. Successful free-to-play video games can generate huge amounts of revenue and establish companies in the new digital distribution market.\nAs I approached the game at Microsoft’s event this week in San Francisco, I was surprised to run into Chris Taylor, the zany chief executive of Gas Powered Games . He disclosed that his company had been working with Robot Entertainment on the project and was now taking over as lead developer on Age of Empires Online. Gas Powered Games has specialized in real-time strategy (where you fight enemies that move at the same time as your own forces), having made ground-breaking games in the PC-focused genre such as Supreme Commander .\nEverybody fretted over the death of real-time strategy when Microsoft shut down Ensemble Studios (the original developer of Age of Empires) a couple of years ago. But it’s hard to kill off a whole genre. Robot was started by former Ensemble Studios veterans and it began work on the online game two years ago. Now it has moved on to another game, Orcs Must Die. Taylor said that created the opportunity for Gas Powered Games to step in and finish the game, which still doesn’t have a launch date but is slated to come out this year.\nThe online-only downloadable game won’t be the same experience as Age of Empires. It has a different art style and you most likely won’t be playing massive battles in the online version, as was possible in the older games. That’s a trade-off that will make the game more marketable. But there are benefits that come from having a persistent world that’s almost like a massively multiplayer online game.\nIan Vogel, a Microsoft producer, said the art style is more accessible. To me, it looks more like a cartoon than the realistic graphics of the older Age of Empires games. One downside is that the game is downloadable. That means users must download it to their computers before they can play it. In the U.S., that’s not a great thing since not everybody has great broadband connections and some people don’t trust downloads. Browser-based games, where no download is required, tend to do better here with the mass market.\nStill, downloadable games can offer a great graphics experience and deep game play. The game has familiar combat between players, and it also has quests to embark upon. You can play cooperatively with friends or challenge them in matches. Since the game is integrated with your friends list on Xbox Live, you can engage in live chat.\nIn this game, your empire’s capital city is always alive in a persistent world. You can customize your city, collect resources, create crafts and then trade them with others. You can build your forces and enter a combat arena with your friends or fight random battles. Those battles are a lot like the older multiplayer real-time combat sessions in the classic games. But now you can gain experience and collect winnings that can be used to build the persistent version of your empire. You can progress through levels and get access to more stuff.\nTaylor says the cool thing about the game is that millions of people could play it without paying a dime. But you can take your civilization to the next level by purchasing a Premium Civilization Pack, which adds new game play and new experiences. The real sales trick for Microsoft is to convert as many people to paid accounts as possible. Typically, only 3 to 5 percent of players will pay, but that generates enough revenue to make a lot of games profitable. Success isn’t guaranteed, however. THQ recently decided to pull the plug on Company of Heroes Online after it failed to get enough people interested in paying.\nWith the premium version, you can get access to rare gear, unlock new units such as Armored Elephants and Civilization Powers. You can explore a full technological development tree, enjoy more player vs. player options, produce more kinds of crafts in new workshops, and earn in-game currency from the stores in your capital city.\nCheck out our video interview with Taylor below.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\n", "deleted" : false }

Livemocha missed the trend of mobile device based language learning and consequently lost its market share and appeal to consumers.\nSmart phones have increasingly replaced stationary PCs as our primary device to access the Internet, search for information, play games and to communicate with others. HelloTalk , an edtech startup based in China, uses these features to offer language learners a global community of like-minded people.\nFounded in 2012 HelloTalk quickly grew through word of mouth, surpassing 1 million registered users in March 2015 and adding an additional 2 million users by the end of March 2016. The community sends around 4 million messages each day and between six to seven thousand new members join HelloTalk on a daily basis.\nThe team at HelloTalk took proven concepts out of social media and integrated them into a dedicated language and culture exchange platform. HelloTalk Moments, for example, is a timeline similar to what people already know from popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram filled with posts about culture and languages from the community.\nThere are several tools to help learners break down communication barriers. HelloTalk features one tap translation for text message and text-to-voice / voice-to-text. Community members can voice call each other for free and leave recorded voice messages. Other features like group video chats and interest-based channels are planned for the near future.\nWe sat down with HelloTalk founder Zackery to ask him about the latest developments.\nIn March 2015 HelloTalk surpassed the 1-million-user-mark, and now one year later the community is close to being 3 million members strong. What drives your impressive growth?\nHelloTalk mainly grows organically through Appstore/Google Play search and users’ word of mouth referral. In 2015 HelloTalk also started doing some marketing which helped.\nWhat are the benefits of launching a language learning product exclusively on mobile\ndevices, and have you experienced any drawbacks also?\nThe benefits are that users can take advantage of their spare time and communicate through instant text and voice messages, as well as voice and video calls. Users can also know the local time and location of their counterparts, plus search language partners based on city.\nThe drawbacks are that sometimes users prefer to do deep learning on desktop computers. Also, certain users prefer to use desktop versions during work time.\nYou are launching a new version of HelloTalk. Tell us more about the new features and how they are going to enhance the learning / cultural experience. What excites you most about the new apps?\nOur new version allows users to post feeds related to language and culture. We also pioneered adding language learning features such as grammar correction, translation, transliteration into feeds. These innovate language learning features allow users to learn languages in a totally fun and exciting new ways. Since launching language Moments feature about two months ago, we are seeing about 15,000 posts a day which is very impressive.\nWhat are the most popular languages people learn on HelloTalk, and what are the most common language pairings?\nAbout 60% of HelloTalk users learn English, followed by Korean, Japanese, Spanish and Chinese. The most common language pairs are:\nKorean <> English\nChinese <> English\nLast time we talked you started to learn Spanish. How is it coming along?\nUnfortunately I haven’t done much on this part cause I am too busy improving HelloTalk with our whole team. This is a bit ironic…\nTechnology has made huge progress when it comes to instant translations (Word Lens, Skype Translator, etc) and HelloTalk also provides its learners with similar features. Some people say that as a consequence language learning won’t be necessary in the future. Why do you believe that it is still important to learn a foreign language?\nI think instant translations fulfill the need of casual use such as travel or basic communication in trade shows, but ultimately people want to communicate more than just that. I actually think instant translations can be used to help people learn languages, the same way HelloTalk uses machine translation to help users learn language through chat.\nWhat are your further plans for HelloTalk in 2016?\nWe hope to grow the user base to 5-6 million. We will introduce the following new functions (to name a few):\n– Dictionary, language learning news reader\n– Short video and voice feed posts\n– Groups (based on location, topics, interest)\nYou can find the HelloTalk app on iTunes and the Google Appstore .\nThis article was sponsored by HelloTalk and written by Kirsten Winkler.\nShare this:\n", "deleted" : false }

Vodafone yesterday announced that they will now be offering double data on pre-paid data recharge packs, effectively bringing down the prices of their data offering to nearly half. Currently, this offer is available in Mumbai only, but is expected to be launched across India.\nOne cannot help but think that this move has something to do with Airtel’s 4G commercial launch. The announcement has come on the same day as Airtel’s 4G launch. Airtel is offering 4G speeds at the same rate as 3G, and it is obvious that many subscribers from other telecom operators may move to Airtel due to their 4G offerings. By doubling the data on the pre-paid data recharges, Vodafone now becomes quite attractive to heavy mobile internet users!\nIshmeet Singh, Business Head-Mumbai, Vodafone India said, “This offer is our way of gratifying our pre-paid customers for choosing Vodafone as their preferred mobile internet provider. We are offering them double value and encouraging new data users to explore the wonders of the internet using Vodafone’s better 3G service”\nWe think that the “double data” offer has been launched in Mumbai because data ARPU in Mumbai is the highest, and Vodafone does not want to risk losing customers to Airtel. Also, Vodafone has big share of subscribers in Mumbai – they have over 4.8 million data users of its overall 8 million customers in Mumbai circle alone,\nWhen is Vodafone 4G coming?\nAirtel’s launch has now pressurized other to launch their 4G services in a hurry. In the 4G auctions held earlier in the year, Vodafone bagged nearly 5 MHz of spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band for Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Kerala. Singh confirmed that Vodafone will be launching 4G services by the end of the year. Vodafone is currently conducting 4G trials in all these 5 circles.\nWith Reliance Jio approaching the market aggressively in 4G services arena, both in terms of offerings and as well as price, it is going to be tough for the incumbents to hold on to their mobile data market share. We are surely in for some intense competition between various telco’s in India.\nShares\n", "deleted" : false }

Flite, which faces competition from Google’s DoubleClick platform, has helped serve twenty-five billion units with more than one hundred and twenty million monthly uniques, and fifty-five million unique daily events captured by Flite’s metrics system. Flite’s publishing partners include LinkedIn, Forbes, Yahoo, CBS Interactive, TechCrunch and brands like Microsoft, L’Oreal, Charles Schwab and Toyota.\nFlite is probably wise to transition the focus of its business to its ad-serving platform.

Today, I address a topic as relevant for early stage startups (vying for consumer attention) as it is for more mature companies (focused on customer relationships):\nHow to grow your brand on Twitter?\nTwitter is the ultimate marketing platform. But the scale of Twitter activity is so extraordinary (250 million tweets per day) that it is quite easy to get lost in the noise… particularly if you are an early-stage startup and/or an emerging brand.\nSeparating yourself from the masses really begins with the recognition that Twitter is first and foremost a platform for conversation. If you believe that, you avoid the mistake most brands make: treating Twitter as a mechanism to push content rather than create engagement.\nAnd once your goal is to foster conversation and engagement, you can follow these five guidelines:\n1.

New York's attorney general says that's probably because more than half of tickets to many events are held for industry insiders or otherwise unavailable to the general public.\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a report released Thursday that his investigation of the industry was prompted by consumer complaints, which his office receives regularly.\n\"Ticketing, to put it bluntly, is a fixed game,\" the report said. Investigators found abuses and practices that prevent consumers from buying tickets at affordable prices or sometimes even getting them at all.\nVenues and sellers like Ticketmaster regularly tacked on fees that added more than 21% to the face value, investigators said. They found that on average, 16% of tickets are reserved for various industry insiders like the venue employees, artists and promoters, while 38% are reserved for presales to certain groups like holders of a particular credit card.\nTicketmaster did not immediately reply Thursday to a request for comment.\nInvestigators found that third-party brokers resell tickets on sites like StubHub and TicketsNow at average margins of 49% above face-value and sometimes more than 1,000%. Some brokers use illegal specialty software, called \"ticket bots,\" to quickly purchase as many desirable tickets as possible for resale at significant markups, they said.\nThe report cited a single broker buying 1,012 tickets within one minute to a U-2 concert at Madison Square Garden when they went on sale on Dec. 8, 2014, despite the vendor's claim of a four-ticket limit. By day's end, that broker and one other had 15,000 tickets to U2's North American shows.\nA call to Madison Square Garden was not immediately returned Thursday.\nThe attorney general also has reached settlements with two ticket brokers operating without a reseller license. The settlements require one company to pay $80,000 and the other $65,000. They and their principals also must maintain a license.\n\"This investigation is just the beginning of our efforts to create a level playing field in the ticket industry,\" Schneiderman said.\nThe attorney general's office issued a report more than 15 years ago that found New York's ticket distribution system was largely underground and provided \"access to quality seating on the basis of bribes and corruption at the expense of fans.\"\nThursday's report said that despite changes in technology and state law, the problems persist, and event ticketing is the great exception to areas of the economy where online sales have yielded lower prices and greater transparency.\n \nAs Advertised in the Calgary SUN\nTop stories\n", "deleted" : false }

We have no further comment at this time. Further updates will be provided as appropriate.\"\nYahoo reportedly has held discussions with Verizon, IAC/Interactive Corp. and CBS Corp., according to the WSJ, but has not yet sat down with Daily Mail executives. Verizon, whose CEO confirmed interest in acquiring Yahoo's core Web business several weeks ago, is widely seen as the leading candidate to pull off a deal .\nYahoo has extended the deadline for receipt of first-round bids from April 11 to April 18, according to reports.\nThe Daily Mail is the latest surprise entrant in the contest. Its bid could take the form of one or two potential deals, the WSJ noted.\nIn one scenario, the private equity partner would take over Yahoo's entire U.S. operation and fold the news and media properties into the Daily Mail. The second scenario would have the private equity partner take control of Yahoo and fold its news and media companies into a new firm, which would include DailyMail.com and Elite Daily.\nThe Daily Mail has been in talks with a half-dozen private equity firms on making a bid, including General Atlantic, according to the WSJ.\nPlenty to Offer\nDespite Yahoo's difficulties as a legacy company, there remains a strong core of Web traffic that might attract traditional media company like the Daily Mail, observed Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at Poynter .\n\"Say what you will about Yahoo,they remain a leader in basic traffic,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"The rap on the company is that they cannot come up with a growth strategy or carve out a distinctive journalistic role.\"\nThe Daily Mail claims about 62 million unique visitors per month in the U.S., citing Comscore data from July 2015.\nYahoo reaches nearly 78 million people per month, making it the ninth biggest website in the country, according to Quantcast.\nYahoo has beefed up its content business over the years, luring major media figures like former CBS anchor Katie Couric, who is global anchor at Yahoo, and former Newsweek investigative reporter Michael Isikoff, who is now the company's chief investigative correspondent.\n\"The news and financial features are good and what makes Yahoo attractive to media companies,\" said Michael Jude, consumer communication services research manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan .\nYahoo's once-leading search engine probably would be folded into another entity, as it is not what it used to be before Google emerged as a leading search provider, he added.\nHowever, the likely scenario is that whichever company acquires Yahoo, it will wind up with the company largely intact, Jude suggested, because the individual parts by themselves are not as attractive.\nIdentity Crisis\n\"What exactly is Yahoo these days? A media company, a personal destination page, a news source, a 22-year-old startup?\" asked Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research .\n\"A case can be made for all of these and none of these,\" he told the E-Commerce Times.\nDefining what Yahoo's mission actually is has \"stymied its management since the leadership of cofounder Jerry Yang, and therefore made the company both malleable and cast hard,\" Krewell said.\n\"Each potential buyer can see it in their own light, but whichever company does get Yahoo will try to mold it to a new owner's whims,\" he predicted. \"It will be hard, and some things will break, and some parts will be sold off.\"\nYahoo will have no comment on the deal process, spokesperson Rebecca Neufeld told the E-Commerce Times -- either regarding the Daily Mail specifically or in general.\nDavid Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey. He has written for Reuters, Bloomberg, Crain's New York Business and The New York Times.\n", "deleted" : false }

You can always find stuff on YouTube,\" Shin added.\nAfter a user watches a video from a brand, YouTube can recommend videos from the same marketer or related videos for the user to watch next.\nIn addition, users are also likely to click on the YouTube page of a brand if they have enjoyed that brand's video, Shin said.\n\"On Facebook, meanwhile, it's more difficult for users to search for a brand's older video content and users are less likely to go to a brand's Facebook page after watching a video,\" Shin said.\nIn its report, Visible Measures analyzed 808 video ads comprising 1.6 billion views from 548 campaigns uploaded in the first half of the year from brands such as Pepsi, Samsung and Dove.\n", "deleted" : false }

However, Wal-Mart will also lose about $800 million this year as it adds online fulfilment centers, invests in systems and continues to hire talent via acquisitions.\nMore about e-commerce strategies\nStudy: 'Showrooming' going mainstream ahead of holiday season\nThe company and e-commerce chief Neil Ashe walked through the e-commerce plans on Wal-Mart's analyst day on Wednesday. The general theme is that Wal-Mart is focused on building a global technology platform that can leverage the retailer's supply chain, distribution and merchandising expertise.\nFor 2014, Wal-Mart expects to spend about $1 billion on e-commerce, up from its target of $800 million and well ahead of the $400 million spent in 2013. Wal-Mart is expecting to invest another $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in 2015 on e-commerce.\nMoving the overall sales needle with e-commerce is a daunting task. Wal-Mart for the fiscal year ending Jan. 30, 2014 is expected to deliver sales of $476.3 billion, up 1.5 percent from fiscal 2013. Wal-Mart's revenue per quarter handily eclipses Amazon's annual sales. \nAccording to Ashe, the goal is give Wal-Mart an omnichannel presence that can link physical and virtual experiences for customers. That goal isn't unique, but Wal-Mart is investing heavily and knows its identity. In other words, Wal-Mart's e-commerce operation isn't looking to do Amazon better than Amazon. Instead, Wal-Mart is looking to take e-commerce, leverage its existing strengths and ultimately land new customers as well as drive wallet share among existing ones.\n\"We know who we are and what matters. We're going to deliver Wal-Mart your way,\" said Ashe at the analyst powwow. \"If you shop with us in multiple formats, you'll shop with us more than anyone else.\"\nAshe highlighted multiple data points showing that mobile apps increase store visits, Savings Catcher, an app that scans receipts to ensure you got the best price possible, and integration points between shipping and physical store pickups.\nOther takeaways on the e-commerce front:\nWal-Mart is building a next-gen supply chain that features shared distribution centers for physical and online, dedicated facilities and ship from store options.\nThe retailer is on a hiring binge via acquisitions such as Adchemy and Tasty Labs as well as fielding more than 34,000 applicants for tech roles. Less than 2 percent of applications were extended offers.\nWal-Mart said it continues to develop its Pangaea, e-commerce operating system that revolves around analyzing data from customers, operators and merchants.\nAs for the big picture, Wal-Mart is expecting growth to come from e-commerce for the foreseeable future and the mission is to make sure technology doesn't cannibalize store sales and adds to them.\nNevertheless, Wal-Mart's capital spending on e-commerce is massive, but still just a slice of the overall pie. This chart from the Telsey Group highlights the cap-ex pie and where e-commerce fits in. The bottom line is that Wal-Mart's e-commerce spending will ding operating earnings for the next few years, but the investment could pay off for years to come. \nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

And then the ad tech companies go public.\nFrancine Hardaway 12.04.13 6:13 AM\nIf you saw the shenanigans behind the scenes in the ad tech data space you’d think the industry was filled with drug dealers all smoking their own inventory. Viewable. Not viewable. Viewable but not seen. Above the fold (that no longer exists in the world of infinite scroll). RTB (a technical term for how fast can I buy?). We're in a room full of egos all running around pretending to be smarter than they are and tricking people out of billions of dollars with machine learning algorithms. And these people have nothing at stake. A frightening number of them have had IPOs recently, too.\nThe sad fact is that ad tech companies can still go public without a sustainable business. Investors in the public markets have no more clue what they're buying than the media planners who use their services.\nMost of the schlock inventory is bought blind but hey, at least it’s at high speed.\nInvestors and advertisers, get real. There is premium inventory and there is garbage. That’s how online media works. You believe audiences are fragmented, and they are, but that doesn't mean you have to buy everything just to reach a precious few.\nMost of the schlock inventory is bought blind but hey, at least it’s at high speed. You have no idea what you are buying, because you buy it on specious audience data. Fortunately, it’s so cheap that any data makes a nice graphic for your boss, you get more spend because they think you’ve \"moved the needle.\" It’s one big conspiracy in which no one questions either the value of the ads or the value of the data that supports them.\nBut then you find out that half the hits you bought at bots. Here's the advice I received from Rodney Mayers, my friend at Proximic , a company that analyzes sites: media buyers, uncheck the box that says you will take \"unknown inventory.\" That will give you both fraud protection and a URL you can get some data on. Buy with some discrimination.\nIf you do buy blind inventory, tell your clients that you are wasting their dollars and putting their brand at risk for being next to, say, Mexican drug lords decapitating a woman. Or hardcore porn.\nAdvertisers are the people with the real money. Demand more. Ask for the data, then audit the data. If you have the money and demand little more in return than a real time buy, you will get what you pay for.\nFor the most part, the digital media industry is a joke and advertisers are being played royally. They know, you don’t know, so you get swindled every time. And the numbers are so big it doesn’t matter.\nChallenge. Everything. Don’t let vendors with Martinis and no data guide you because in the end, they will go public and your industry will have a black eye.\nNewsletter\nGet the latest Fast Company stories delivered to your inbox daily.\nSend\nI'd also like to receive special Fast Company offers\nMust Reads\n", "deleted" : false }

(That’s Armstrong at the right of the photo with Adap.tv CEO Amir Ashkenazi.) “The Adap.tv founders and team are on a mission to make advertising as easy as e-commerce and the two companies together will aggressively pursue that vision.”\nThis tops the $315 million that AOL paid for the Huffington Post, making it the company’s largest acquisition since Armstrong became CEO in 2009. Business Insider reported in July that AOL had made an offer of about $400 million for the company.\nAdap.tv will operate as an independent part of AOL’s video organization, which is led by senior vice president Ran Harnevo, and which itself is part of the broader ad offerings at AOL Networks (where Bob Lord was recently hired as CEO ). The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.\nOne of Armstrong’s big themes this year has been programmatic ad-buying, where ads are bought in an automated way — a couple of weeks ago he announced plans for a “programmatic upfront” event at Advertising Week. In the release, he says that Adap.tv is at the “forefront” of both the programmatic trend ad and the shift from traditional TV to online video.\nAdap.tv supported more than 26,000 ad campaigns that ran on 9,500 websites, AOL says.\nThe video ad company was founded in 2006 and has raised a total of $48.6 million in funding. Investors include Gemini Israel Funds, Redpoint Ventures, Spark Capital, and Bessemer Venture Partners.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

The first solution, TIBCO BusinessWorks™ Container Edition, enables large businesses to gain all the value of cloud-based deployments and to achieve continuous delivery, while rapidly scaling to meet peak demands. The second solution, TIBCO® Cloud Integration, is a lightweight platform purpose-built for the cloud that features a streamlined user interface for API development. It's an integration Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) for easily creating, governing, and consuming services and APIs, with the added benefit that organizations can smoothly spin out those services internally and externally on demand. Both offerings advance TIBCO's vision of providing solutions designed for customers to quickly and easily leverage cloud technology.\n\"Integration is a critical capability of a digital business; it means being able to connect and engage on multiple channels,\" said Matt Quinn, chief technology officer, TIBCO. \"Our 'Cloud First' approach is really about offering new consumption models for our customers, helping them access the value of the TIBCO® Fast Data platform in new ways. It also expands the types of users who can make use of our technologies by making it easier for users to create, configure, and deploy APIs. Combining these new capabilities with the recent addition of Mashery's market-leading API management solution, we now offer a whole new class of cloud integration.\"\nTIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition is a streamlined version of TIBCO's flagship product and is available as a buildpack for easy deployment, upgrading, and operating within the Pivotal Cloud Foundry™ environment. In instances where companies are dealing with regulatory requirements or sensitive data, this solution provides workload control flexibility, allowing the organization to provision information in a setting of their choosing, from on-premises to hybrid cloud.\nOther notable benefits of TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition:\nSimplicity - users can easily provision to a Cloud Foundry environment with just a few commands, radically reducing deployment times to just a few minutes;\nFlexibility - the platform can operate in different environments, irrespective of the infrastructure that it is running on; and\nGreater control - organizations wanting to maintain jurisdiction over their cloud environments can now move that responsibility in-house.\n\"Enterprise demand for rapid development of applications that deliver new customer experiences quickly and at-scale continues to grow,\" said James Watters, vice president and general manager, Cloud Platform Group at Pivotal. \"We are very pleased that TIBCO recognizes Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the platform of choice for running modern, cloud-native applications. With the availability of TIBCO BusinessWorks on Pivotal Cloud Foundry, our joint customers can confidently invest in developing the next generation of applications for the cloud.\"\nTIBCO Cloud Integration is designed to offer mid-market businesses integration functionality via the cloud. In cases where departments are seeking to rapidly create and deploy APIs, developers can build and test these services without having to involve overburdened IT staff.\nOther notable benefits of TIBCO Cloud Integration:\nVersatility - organizations can choose to use it as a standalone product or as part of a hybrid integration solution; and\nCost-effectiveness - the platform is a subscription-based service, which reduces upfront capital investments and enables rapid startup.\nTIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition will be generally available in Q4 2015.

Kuo\n \nIt's not often that startups come out of the gate, backed by a private equity investor. However, Los Angeles-based Colony Logic ( www.colonylogic.com ) is one of the few, having gotten its initial backing from private equity firm Blackstone. The company is focused on the enterprise software area. We spoke with Andy Vogel, COO of the company, to learn more about Colony Logic and its business.\nWhat is Colony Logic?\nAndy Vogel: We're essentially answering the basic question, if technology is supposed to make life simple, more organized, and more efficient, why it does not do that. We're finding that companies have many obsolete, legacy systems which they are using, rather than new solutions, which are essentially creating that flawed environment. Companies are spending as much as 70 percent of their typical IT budget on supporting legacy systems, as opposed to investing in new systems that could make a business more efficient. We're here essentially to solve that problem.\nHow do you do that?\nAndy Vogel: We do that by providing deep integration into a variety of CRM sytsems, ERP systems, and tying it all together on the back end, with a reporting and analytics toolset, which allows you to create business intelligence to make the right decisions for businesses.\nWho are your cusotmers?\nAndy Vogel: Typically, we are looking at people who have complex or very large product catalogs. They usually have a CRM which is operating in a silo, and they have lots of distributed sellers across a wide geography, which gives them issues about getting to that single source of truth across all of their systems. We've created one system to pull it all together for them, so that they operate more efficiently on sales, operations, order entry, fulfillment, and billing. Ultimately, we also offer up all the analytics to help them make better decisions for their business. It's usually a large enterprise with lots of moving parts.\nWhat's the story behind the company?\nAndy Vogel: We originally started back in 2010, when Blackstone making investment in companies that weren't very obviously companies they were going to spin out. As they started to make thse investments in technology companies and technologists they liked, they create Talus Labs. Talus Labs was a rollup of a variety of different technology companies. Gumiyo is one of the companies we acquired. As we went along that path, we decided to focus on creating a platform, really focused on the back office automation area. We've spend the last two years in the lab environment, and have tested it with one large customer, and are now rolling it out to commercial customers.\nHow are you backed, it looks like you're entirely private equity backed?\nAndy Vogel: Blackstone is our primary funding partner. They gave us our initial raise.\nWhat's your hardest challenge as a company?\nAndy Vogel: Our biggest challenge is hiring sales talent. It's very hard to find really great talent. We're actively hiring, and are specifically looking for sales people.\nWhat's your next big goal?\nAndy Vogel: Our big goal right now is to get lots of customers in different industries. We have four customers in different phases of launch, as we continue to grow we want to be able to point to use cases in different industries, such as a use case for financial services, another use case in the automotive area, another in insurance, and so on. That's our biggest challenge, and our biggest focus now is to show traction with customers, show our ability to scale, so we can grow.\nThanks!\n", "deleted" : false }

The simple, utilitarian site is a shining example of how the p2p Web can work, and one of the secrets to its success is the anonymization of its users by email forwarding and masking. Many people who wouldn’t want their real email addresses published can use an anonymous, temporary @cragislist.org address to keep things private while maintaining email as a valid form of commercial communication.\nGumiyo.com is working on a very similar concept, but for phone usage. Using its oh-so-Web 2.0 classified site to buy or sell items, a seller or buyer can be hooked up via telephone by using “disposable” phone numbers. If you find something you like, you enter your phone number and a verification code and hit “Send!”. Your number is auto-magically paired with a Gumiyo number and this number is sent to the seller. When he or she calls it, it basically forwards to yours. It even works with text messaging, a neat feature.\nIt’s free for sellers and buyers, and compliments Gumiyo’s other advanced features, like txtmsg notifications and threaded sale discussions. The service is powered by telephony start up JAJAH, who seems to share Gumiyo’s philosophy that, in time, you won’t need a computer to buy things on the Internet.\n", "deleted" : false }

Video search is not about words, optimization or getting into the traditional web search engines. Instead, he says we must look to video consumers and more collaborative approaches.\nIt’s telling that Chao, who’s all about our cultural zeitgeist, is currently running an online portal for How-To videos. Chao is best-known as the originator of America’s Most Wanted and Cops, and later served as USA Network’s president.\nAccording to Chao, we’re just at the beginning of video consumption on the web. Today, average Americans are still attached to their televisions and he believes it’s only a matter of time until Americans shift and become “internet viewing zealots.” Improving findability is critical for this transformation.\nVideo search is more about emotions than words. That’s why Chao advises to think differently and transform video search into a push rather than pull experience — and to find ways to push relevant video results and answers before there is a query.\n“There will be a place for good quality,” said Chao. “In that huge amount of video, this room has the secrets.” At the Summit, the room was filled with web video search insiders, including Blinx, CastTV, ClipBlast, Dabble, Everyzing, Pixsy, and Truveo/AOL.\nChao identified Amazon’s collaborative filtering for books as a starting point. He encouraged the video searchers to develop approaches which take advantage of community interests. He wants us to incorporate consumption behaviors but not depend on popularity contests. All these insights should support video search and discovery.\nOf course, I applaud Chao’s statements and also acknowledge we have some work ahead. With all the video search engines, we are relying on words, tagging and textual approaches today. There’s no doubt that we will have to harness people’s behaviors and interests, in more implicit ways, to really improve video findability.\nRelated reading\n", "deleted" : false }

Companies\nYesterday, I wrote a high level summary of this year’s Venture Capital in the Rockies conference .  I thought I’d give the local press one more day to see if anyone was going to write something substantive about some of the companies presenting.  I haven’t seen anything, so here are my thoughts on the companies I saw. \n24 companies presented in two tracks so the most I could see was 12.  I had a couple of conference calls during the day so I only managed to see 7 of them: Collective Intellect, Confio Software, HomeSphere, Solidware Technologies, iPosi, CreekPath Systems, and XAware.  The only company on this list that I directly have an investment in is Collective Intellect, although I have indirect investments (through VC funds that I’m an LP in) in XAware as well as Collective Intellect.  I’ve listed the companies in rank order starting with the one that I thought was most interesting / did the best job.\nCollective Intellect : I backed the founders – Don Springer and Tim Wolters – in their previous company (Dante Group – acquired in 2003 by WebMethods.)  Don and Tim are super second time entrepreneurs, and the way they’ve started up Collective Intellect shows.  Their tag line is “filtering new media for the securities industry” – they are using a bunch of hard core computer science to analyze new media content (blogs, chat rooms, discussion forums) for public market fund traders, analysts, portfolio managers, and quants (i.e. the dudes at hedge funds.)  The intersection of new media, heavy computer science, and the massive hedge fund dollars sounds like a good place to hunt.  Don did a great presentation and announced their round of funding led by Appian Ventures .\nConfio Software : I met the CEO and primary backer of Confio – Charlie Sanders – about 18 months ago when he first got involved with Confio and its cofounder Matt Larson.  Charlie’s an impressive guy having been a senior exec at Seagate (and previously Conner Peripherals.)  It sounds like 2005 was a very good year for them as they landed 40 new customers, although reading between the lines it appeared that one or two customers accounted for about 50% of their revenue.  Confio’s market – IT performance management – is a crowded one, but they appear to be doing some unique stuff around digging into the Oracle database layer to look for root cause defects (ah – “root cause” – the holy grail of all APM companies.)  Charlie a super salesman and is determined to scale the business up nicely on modest capital.  He’s off to a good start.\nXAware : Tim Harvey, the new CEO of XAware, did a super job of presenting after a mere three weeks on the job.  I generally like XAware – it’s in a market segment (SOA middleware) that I like, understand, and have made some money in.  However, I don’t understand their approach to the business.  While they generated a respectable $3m of revenue last year, it appears that most of it came from financial services customers.  Consequently, I don’t understand why they present themselves as a horizontal SOA middleware provider when they could be kicking ass in the deep pocketed financial services vertical.\nHomeSphere : I’ve got to hand it to James Waldrop and his team – they raised money in 2000/2001, survived their market falling apart, focused on growing slower but getting profitable, and have accomplished that.  They now have a respectable $10m business that sells two things: (1) manufacturer incentive and rebate service for through group buying (80%) and (2) construction management software (20%).  While #1 is a solid growth business (and HomeSphere has likely gotten to an interesting critical mass), #2 looks like a flat to declining business.  As a result, HomeSphere is looking to raise $10m to roll out three new lines of business (none of which I can remember a few days later.)  I don’t understand why they’d do this – if I was on their board I’d say “no more money – stay profitable – grow aggressively in segment #1.”\nSolidware Technologies : Sue Kunz, the CEO of Solidware, is a firecracker.  I’ve known her and her gang for about a year and watched them do unnatural acts (ah – the joys of entrepreneurship) to get their “ Splat Software ” up and running.  Splat is an SQA product (software quality assurance) that helps identify software defects through visual analysis of the source code.  I declined to invest last year as I’ve already got an investment in a somewhat competitive company ( Klocwork ), but I’ve tried to be helpful and encouraging to Sue and her team because I like their style.  I only caught the tail end of Sue’s presentation so I don’t know how she did, but she handled the Q&A nicely.\niPosi : I don’t get iPosi.  They presented a vision for a set of E911 products based on GSM-based location combined with IP geolocation (they are talking to one of my companies – Quova – about working together.)  I listened to the presentation and really didn’t understand either (a) what exactly they were going to do or (b) how they were going to do it.  My brain was working hard when I saw their revenue slide – immediately afterwards my nose started bleeding and I started fantasizing about steep upward sloping exponential curves.  I know – and like – a few of the people involved – I’m sure I’m missing something obvious.\nCreekPath Systems : I remember looking at Creekpath in 2000 when it was originally spun off from Exabyte.  I was pretty excited about funding it until one of my partners vomited all over the floor after meeting with the team.  As a result I passed – am I’m glad I did.  They’ve been through a lot of ups and downs and retooled their leadership team – again – last year.  Creekpath is a good example of the endlessly elusive storage success animal (hardware or software) that tantalizes, but eludes, the Colorado VC.  Maybe this will be the one, but as many have gone before them, they have a long road ahead of them.  I keep hearing that none of the storage vendors have this, but then I think about EMC’s software group and just shake my head.\nOh, and Seth and Chris assured me that the skiing on Wednesday was outstanding and the skiing on Friday was social (e.g. not much fresh powder, but lots of friends hanging around, blue skies, and 60 degrees.)\n", "deleted" : false }

After our selection, the companies pay a fee to present. Our coverage of them remains objective.\nVirtual worlds haven’t fared well as users migrate to social networks. But that hasn’t stopped David Post from launching Next Island . Today at DEMO, the company is formally launching an awareness campaign for its virtual world and enabling the key feature of the world that could be most appealing for users: time travel.\nNext Island has been in the works for nearly three years. The virtual world opened for its first beta test  in December . The world has since grown to nearly 2,000 users and the company is drawing attention to the high quality of its 3D graphics and the sheer creativity of its sci-fi adventure themed world.\nAs we noted before, the enterprise is a test of whether virtual worlds have a place in the modern landscape of gaming, where most of the excitement revolves around social games such as CityVille, mobile games such as Angry Birds, or traditional console games and PC online titles such as World of Warcraft. But Post believes there are casual gamers out there who are hungry for a deeper experience than what they can get now.\n“We are targeting the market we call ‘power casuals,'” he said. “What if a world existed that had the beauty and game play of World of Warcraft and yet was easy to play and had the community of CityVille?”\nA number of virtual worlds that raised a lot of money have failed in recent times. The losers include There.com, Vivaty, and Metaplace.\nNext Island is a sci-fi adventure paradise built on top of infrastructure created by MindArk , which has created the massively multiplayer online virtual universe, Entropia Universe . The universe consists of a number of planets such as Planet Calypso . Next Island is a new planet in the universe. Unlike other worlds, the time travel theme gives Next Island a chance to have a wide diversity of imagery. The first major section that visitors can travel to is ancient Greece. Within that sub-world, players can go on a variety of missions. Other sections will come online over time.\nNext Island will be run as a free-to-play game, where users can create, purchase and trade virtual goods within the world. What’s distinct about Next Island is that users will be able to cash out, converting virtual money into real world money. That’s possible since Entropia runs its own virtual bank, which has been recognized as a real bank by Sweden (Entropia Universe is based in Sweden.) Over time, users will be able to travel from era to era and from planet to planet.\nPost founded Next Island in 2008. He was a serial entrepreneur who founded and sold both pager company Page America and Cellular Systems. So he funded Next Island himself in the hopes of reviving a childhood fantasy. Each day for a brief time when he was young, starting at the age of nine, he wrote the story about the parallel universe of Elysium, where it seems like paradise, but where danger lurks under the surface. He worked on the world for eight years, but he had to wait 30 years for the technology to catch up with what he wanted to do.\nThe  back story is that the rich people of the world buy a set of islands  and then create an isolated paradise hidden from the rest of the world.  One of the islands has a portal into time that can be used to visit  places such as ancient Greece, which is now ready for players to see in demo form. Players will teleport from age to age. If players acquire weapons in a modern age, they won’t be able to take them back to an earlier age. They’ll have to earn new weapons and use them to hunt monsters. You’ll also mine for valuable resources and use them to make things that can be sold for virtual currency. The virtual world has a real cash economy; every transaction is tracked and reported.\nPost said he waited a decade to put together this business. About three years ago, he got serious about doing a virtual world. He met the MindArk people and decided to leverage all of the planet-building resources they had already developed. He recruited   John Jacobs, who goes by the avatar Neverdie in Calpyso ,  to help head his development studio. Jacobs became famous in 2005  because he mortgaged his house and spent $100,000 in real money on a  virtual asteroid in the Entropia Universe. He opened a place called Club  Neverdie and turned it into a real business. Post also recruited other  luminaries in the game industry. Post has three employees and has hired 18 Neverdie developers to build his world.\nSo far, Post has invested $1 million in the world. Outside investors include Loeb Partners, former Merrill Lynch media analyst Hal Vogel, Katlean de Monchy, Jon Jacobs and an unnamed banker from Citi. De Monchy will serve as the spokeswoman in TV ads and other marketing efforts. The first marketing partnership is with Y&R, where Next Island will create a virtual reality series called Avatarette.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPress Releases\n", "deleted" : false }

Since September of 2000, Family Legacy has been dedicated to accomplishing one goal: transforming the nation of Zambia one child at a time. The organization connects American families with the orphaned and vulnerable children of Zambia to proclaim the gospel, transform lives, and rescue orphans. They accomplish their mission through three main ministries: CampLife, Legacy Academies, and Tree of Life. After a rigorous software evaluation, Family Legacy chose Intacct over other on-premises and cloud solutions as the best fit to meet the needs of the organization.\nPrevious Business Challenges Faced by Family Legacy's Finance Team:\nDue to the limitations of their legacy accounting software, Family Legacy did not have the capacity to report on all tier levels of their organization.\nWithout visibility, right down to the lowest level of the program initiatives within the financial platform, the finance team dealt with unnecessary reconciliation and research.\nWithout the ability to provide leadership with detailed reporting - measuring trends and relationships over time - they had difficulty making good decisions for future growth.\nReasons for Selecting Intacct:\nIntacct provides Family Legacy with access to their financial information from anywhere with Internet access, whether it be in Texas or in Zambia.\nIntacct provides the organization with electronic workflows and approvals in every area needed, and will provide their team with real-time visibility into the data through easy to read dashboard reports.\nIntacct’s open API environment makes it easy to work with other systems, pulling in operational data to inform their decision making.\nHighlighted Comments from Family Legacy's Chief Accounting Officer:\n\"I’ve done another accounting system implementation and to compare that experience with this one was night and day,\" said Sommer Clayman, Chief Accounting Officer at Family Legacy. \"We love how customizable Intacct is. We have so much more data than we ever had before – it used to have be very summarized revenue data that didn’t tell us anything. The AcctTwo team was great – we’re happy as can be and we’re really happy with Intacct. Everything on the AcctTwo side was right on time.\"\nAdditional resources:\n", "deleted" : false }

Yet, it still can’t do anything crazy like telling how hot or cold an object is just from looking at it.\nOr can it?\nThis week, I tested a seriously cool (and hot) device: The Seek thermal camera. It weighs half an ounce, measures just three inches long and plugs into an iPhone or Android smartphone so you can “see” in the dark. You do this by holding up your phone with the Seek thermal attached, aiming it at an object in front of you and seeing hot or cold represented by colors on your screen. An on-screen button lets you toggle between still photos and video.\nStarting today, this tiny camera is sold online for $200. This price is pretty remarkable, considering that industrial versions of thermal cameras used by firefighters, police and contractors cost between $3,000 and $5,000 — and those prices are lower than ever in the past 10 years.\nI’ve been testing the iPhone version of the Seek thermal camera, and I found it fun to use. It’s more of a niche product and, in my life, worked mostly as a parlor trick.\nI used it to snap a thermal shot of my boss, Walt Mossberg, holding a chilly iced coffee.\nHe returned the favor with a lovely shot of me, which portrays me as a cartoon character with cold lips.\nWhen I snuck into my son’s nursery to check on him at night, as I usually do, I used the Seek thermal camera instead of my flashlight, and saw a hot glow coming from his crib.\nThe Seek thermal camera also works for more functional purposes. For example, if you had raccoons in your neighborhood and your dog didn’t get along with those raccoons, you could hold your Seek thermal camera up and scan your backyard for raccoons before letting your dog out at night. You could hold it up to the ceiling to figure out exactly where water was pooling. Or you could scan a parking lot for people before walking out to your car alone in the dark.\nSeek Thermal, a Santa Barbara-based startup, collaborated with Raytheon and Freescale Semiconductor to build this tiny camera. It’s competing against an existing alternative — the $349 Flir One from Flir Systems, a well-known company in the thermal-imaging world. Along with its comparatively higher price, the Flir One is limited by design: Its thermal camera is housed in a phone case that currently only fits the iPhone 5 or 5s.\nBoth Flir Systems and Seek Thermal have made their technology workable with other devices, so we may see thermal functions built into smartphone cameras sometime in the not-so-distant future. This would let people skip the step of plugging in a thermal camera, like Seek, or putting the phone in a special case, like the Flir One.\nThe Seek thermal camera’s corresponding app is well done, but I only tested a prerelease version of it; it’s expected to be released in the Google Play and Apple App Store in about two weeks.\nMy three favorite features in the app were an on-screen temperature indicator that shows the hottest and coldest temperatures in any shot, a slider that lets you glimpse something with or without thermal detection, and the app’s variety of 16 thermal-camera colors.\nSince you won’t want to keep the Seek thermal camera plugged into your phone, it comes with a hard case that can attach to a keychain.\nMost people will do what I did, taking this camera out once in a while for short spurts of time. That’s a good idea, because the Seek thermal camera uses your phone’s battery to operate.\nIn the company’s extreme use-case scenario test, which kept the iPhone display on and the camera on and plugged into an iPhone 6 with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular and cellular data on, and screen brightness at 50 percent, the iPhone battery died after three hours and 42 minutes.\nIn Re/code tests, the iPhone 6 battery lasted 14 or 15 hours in normal use-case scenarios without any cameras attached.\nFor now, the Seek thermal camera is fun for a little while, but most people will be frustrated by having to take it out and plug it into their smartphones. Unless you have a specific use case for this technology, you won’t mind waiting to use its features when they are built into smartphone cameras.\nrecode_divider\n", "deleted" : false }

He is the COO of World Singles Networks , and has been focused on diaspora dating around the world. EligibleGreeks and ArabLounge are two of their largest dating sites. And they're doing very nicely. I learned that they run it with a virtual team, and I thought you'd like to learn more about this way of operating. Here's my interview with Mr Romeo. - Mark Brooks\nWhen did you go virtual?\nWorld Singles Networks went virtual back in 2011. Up until then we were in a relatively large office given the size of our team. As the months went by, the office became less and less frequented in a very natural, organic way. Folks were working more from home in a blended capacity. And due to a rewrite of our main application, our development team expanded rapidly across several different regions of the country.\nHow did that transition go?\nFor the most part the transition was smooth. Being that so much of what we do already happens through a digital interface, there weren't too many adjustments we had to make from an operational standpoint. Even when our offices were side by side, it was more common for communications to be channeled through several different channels/tools. Over the years we have used an evolving array of services.\nWhat project management tools do you use?\nFor project management and more, Basecamp has been a part of our workflow for some time, less so recently. Backpack (Basecamp retured this product recently) has been helpful for simple task management between small teams and groups. We've used Unfuddle (Kanban card system that is more advanced than Trello ), and a little Pivotal Tracker (agile project management tool of choice) for more development-centric ticket/project management. And InVision is now finding a way into our mix of tools, mainly as a specialized space for design management. Unfuddle's latest product, One, looks promising as a lightweight task manager.\nAny other tools?\nFor messaging, presence, and real-time communication we've used Skype, Screenhero, Yammer, Google Hangout, Campfire, GoToMeeting and are beginning to experiment with how Slack may fit into our rhythm.\nFor non-sensitive file sharing and storage we've used Dropbox along with the built-in file management features of various other products. \nFor process modeling (BPMN 2.0) and information visualization we've been using Microsoft Visio, Tableau, XMind, and Lucidcharts. Screencast, TinyGrab, Jing, have been used for sharing quick links to screencaps. We share a lot of screencaps.\nWhat we use is in constant flux and differs across teams and departments. Certain services fall in and out of vogue. We trust that the utility of each of the tools in our set will survive on their own merits without the need for any sort of official decree or centralized decision-making.\nWhat were the initial challenges and surprises?\nWhat was probably most surprising was all of the little things. We are humans--nourished by so many subtle, semi-tangible, often invisible energies. These energies are only noticed, if at all, by their absence. An easy smile, the fist bump, jokes at the water cooler. Especially curated details of weekend trips. Urgency. Nuance. The scrunched nose--I don't understand what you're saying. The nodding head--I totally understand you. Sarcasm even, which can be so difficult in virtual spaces.\nThere are so many bits of information, so many signals that can be meaningful that are no longer transmitted. In a physical space, you see who is meeting with whom, for how long; you get a sense of the vibe and tone just from the richness of ambient sounds and background conversations; the orbits and rotations of visiting vendors. Small talk with the mail carrier. You can feel when others are in the zone sometimes just by the rhythm of keyboard clicks (or the lack thereof.)\nGone is the surety of connection that eye contact affords. (Is there such a thing as eye contact in the virtual world? Looking directly at the camera as if reading from a teleprompter?) \nWe miss out on shades of privacy. By having so much control over what gets transmitted, we tend towards sanitization. We mute our microphones to politely silence the noise of chomping lettuce, strange ticks and buzzes lurking in the cables. The virtual office and its various channels can be either on or off making us sometimes long for a more analog experience.\nHow has it worked out?\nOf course there was the immediate improvement to the bottom line :) The virtual office also instantly expanded the scale of the talent pool we could draw from. Many on the local team were thrilled to eliminate commutes and the related machinations. Reducing our carbon footprint felt good too. As well, with far less verbal touchpoints we had to be much more specific with our written communications and specifications; this has probably improved our writing skills and contributed to better documentation habits. \nIt'd be disingenuous of me to say that I don't miss being with folks though. Our company conferences are such a source of inspiration and camaraderie, for instance. Much of that is probably a product of basking together in all of the intangibles. The atmosphere upon everyone's arrival on day one is simply electric.\nWill you stick with being virtual as the company grows further?\nThere will always be a place for the virtual experience in the life of our company; it has come with many important advantages both tactical and strategic. And given how technologies continue to shrink and bend time and space, distributed workforces are pretty much here to stay. As World Singles grows to the next level, our sense is that we will most likely evolve to a form between the virtual and the physical; realizing the maximum benefit that both approaches have to offer. Why just have your cake when you can eat it too?\nWhat advice would you have for anyone considering moving to using a distributed workforce?  \nGiven the added complexity of the rapidly shifting technological environment in which we operate, a monolithic approach to anything is probably not a good idea. I'd advise folks who are considering moving to a distributed workforce to view it as a tool, not as a solution.  The days of either/or are long gone. I'd love to go to outer space but I wouldn't want to live there full time; at least not yet :)\nAs far as specific ideas on how to make the most of a virtual workspace, think of it like being an astronaut.  Folks in the virtual office sometimes experience feelings of social isolation; they wrestle with reduced physical movement and stimulation. Differences in time and the logistics of communication must be taken into account. Astronauts are trained with these and other such considerations in mind. They develop deliberate practices to counter the effects of a zero G space. Here are some suggestions for the virtual office astronaut:\nDon't pocket all the savings from dropping office rent from the books. Reinvest a portion of those savings on team building exercises and opportunities for folks to meet in-person throughout the year.\nUtilize video as much as you can. While it sure doesn't beat face-to-face interaction, a video call helps to restore a richer information exchange between participants. It provides a sense of place and context. It matters if it's snowing outside of a colleague’s window. It's cool when a cat skips effortlessly across your teammate’s desk. Plus, you'll have to groom a little more often. This is a good thing.\nCultivate virtual norms.  We have to shift what we think of as good manners in virtual spaces since we have fewer tools to soften and contour what we say. Technology will tend to exaggerate succinctness and directness; help make this okay--especially for those on the team who may be a little extra sensitive in risking offending others.  Help make it safe for people to communicate explicitly. It can be a boost to clarity, trust, and getting to the point. You may think emojis, emoticons and the like are a bit silly. They are J  However, they can go a long way in helping to express tone.  Consider adding them to your messages especially whenever there is extra risk for misinterpretation or ambiguity.\nDo you have a no-disturb protocol?  It's a lot easier to see when someone's busy when you walk over to his or her desk--there's no need to put up a sign. In a virtual space, folks may not want to seem rude or unavailable by posting a do not disturb sign.  Flow and mojo are crucial to productivity and creativity; intentionally create room for virtual quiet. Sometimes we all can be just a stray pop-up notification away from falling out of the zone.\nUnite distributed space through movement; experiment with walking meetings and group game play.\nPromote sketching, drawing, diagramming and sharing of created artifacts. Take extra steps to help people ‘see’ what you’re saying and improve operational alignment at the say time.\nConstantly ask the question:  how does our virtual space promote our core human qualities--courage, trust, empathy? When we don't have to share bad news face-to-face, when we can avoid an awkward conversation with a note left on IM, we sometimes lose out on those opportunities to practice being (a better) human.  The same goes for a pat on the back and those moments between the hustle when we celebrate what we've accomplished. Together. Better humans make better companies.\nMark Brooks: The Courtland Brooks team have been a distributed workforce from day 1, back in January 2005. Tools I recommend are Sococo for team communications, and creating a virtual office. Teamwork for project management complete with Gantt charting. Basecamp for lite document collaboration and communications. Freshbooks for invoicing. Uberconference for client calls. We don't actually do company conferences but I see this as essential for companies where the majority of the workforce are full time. We have water-cooler calls on occasion, where the team just natter, and we introduce new members of the team as we add special advisors. The best book IMHO on remote-working culture is The Year Without Pants which is about the distributed workforce that runs Wordpress.\n", "deleted" : false }

But this week, the company says it’s added two more high-profile names: investor Richard Branson and food and personal product giant Unilever .\nNeither Branson nor Unilever disclosed the amounts of their investments, but Solazyme said the financings were part of the Series D round announced last month . Solazyme said in August that it had raised $52 million for the Series D round, but reportedly the amount has been bumped up to $60 million since then.\nAdvertisement\nBritish entrepreneur Branson, best known for his Virgin (s vmed) brand that’s spawned everything from planes to cell phones, personally invested in Solazyme for this round, while his venture firm Virgin Green Fund has backed other biofuel companies like Gevo. Branson said in a statement that he was “excited about    Solazyme’s potential to make oils for fuels, chemicals and foods at    scale.”\nAdvertisement\nUnilever, which makes food and personal care products that can use algae oil, already had an R&D partnership with Solazyme, and has tested the algae oils in its products. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Unilever wants to use algae to replace palm oil, because the harvesting of palm oil has led to deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia and has drawn the criticism of environmentalists.\nAdvertisement\nThe first applications for Solzayme’s algae oil will be food and products like lotions. When I visited Solazyme’s headquarters last year, I drank some of the company’s prototype algae milk (like soy or rice milk), and checked out some of their oils and lotions under development in their labs (see image to the left). In that sense, Unilever will be a very important partner.\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, the company wants to scale up algae oil production to tackle the biofuel market: hence why a company like Chevron is interested. The company is looking to commercialize its technology in the 2012-2013 time frame, with a production cost target of $60 to $80 per barrel. To get there, it will have to build a commercial-scale algae plant, which can cost over $100 million.\nAdvertisement\nUnlike some algae fuel companies that grow algae in open ponds, Solazyme engineers efficient algal strains and grows its designer algae in  fermentation tanks without sunlight by feeding it sugar, then using existing industrial equipment to extract the oil. Solazyme is a leader in the algae fuel space, but competes with Sapphire Energy, Craig Venter’s Synthetic Genomics, Aurora Biofuels and a handful of other companies that are looking to scale up algae oil production. The market could even be getting too heated;  earlier this year , a company called PetroAlgae, which grows algae, filed an S-1 announcing its plans to go public.\nAdvertisement\nFor more research on cleantech financing check out GigaOM Pro (subscription required):\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

The HPA Tech Retreat UK is a pivotal gathering for those engaged in the many disciplines supporting the creation, management and dissemination of content across the dynamic landscape of distribution environments. The curated programme will focus on the present and future impact of the most recent technology in broadcast and cinema. It offers a unique opportunity and intimate setting to delve into the critical topics facing the content industry. The HPA Tech Retreat is presented in association with SMPTE Ltd.\nAttendees will have an exclusive opportunity to get behind the scenes on the making of the HBO production, the \"Game of Thrones\". This special session will examine the production and post of the smash hit series. An all-star panel will lift the lid on the epic series' creative and technical work, investigating everything from on-set technology, visual effects (VFX) and sound. The session also will take an in-depth look at HBO's ground-breaking use of Dolby Atmos object-based audio in the production and the challenges of creating and delivering this to the home.\nThe HPA Tech Retreat SuperSession will be led by industry leaders at work in ultra-high-definition (UHD), high-dynamic-range imaging (HDR), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and more, who will bring their studied perspectives to the topics that are of crucial impact to the industry. The SuperSession, which takes place on the first day of the two-day event, is an in-depth series of panels entitled \"Ultra Everything and Emerging Media Technology\". \"Ultra Everything\" will explore what UHD and associated technological advances mean for content creators and the audience. The line-up will include major UK and US broadcasters focusing on how the increases in frame rates, colour, dynamic range and object-based audio are affecting content. This session will be a wide-ranging look at HDR, higher frame rates (HFR), wider colour gamut (WCG), 4K and beyond.\n\"Emerging Media Technology\" will examine how emerging technologies, including VR and AR, will affect the users' experience. The HPA Tech Retreat UK will introduce important questions and open them for serious analysis, such as, Will cinema become a VR world? Will AR find its way into the cinema? Will on-demand technologies take theatregoers into a new era of experiential choice? Is VR content already mainstream?\nBehind-the-scenes peeks at other productions will be announced shortly.\nAdditional topics for the two-day event include Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) vs. perceptual quantiser (PQ); the Interoperable Master Format - IMF - and the European view from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU); the \"Consumer Technology Review\" will look at the latest technology, trends and consumer behaviour; VFX; cloud workflows; file-based delivery; connectivity; over-the-top (OTT); versioning; production finance; and more.\nRichard Welsh, co-chair of the HPA Tech Retreat UK, commented, 'The HPA Tech Retreat UK will place some of the most compelling ideas into discussion, led by the individuals and companies who are driving the industry forward. The HPA alongside SMPTE colleagues, are working closely to put forth one of the most engaging, and in some cases, challenging series of sessions in the industry. The Tech Retreat is also a place where you spend a lot of time outside of the session rooms and theatre, talking, debating and discussing what you've just seen'.\nA separate event, the Charles Poynton & John Watkinson Seminar: \"Practical Aspects of HDR: Implementation and Deployment\", will take place on 12 July. These highly regarded experts will explore the crucial technology that touches acquisition, post production/digital intermediate (DI) (especially colour grading), studio display, mastering, distribution, and display in both cinema and home. The session will begin with an overview of the theory of HDR - in particular, psychophysics and visual appearance aspects - and go on to investigate the implementation and deployment of HDR in cinema and video. In particular, Poynton and Watkinson will discuss metadata and its interpretation, and adaptation of the HDR system to varying display and viewing characteristics. Expect discussion of last-minute developments. Delegates may attend this event alone or add it to their Tech Retreat registration.\nAdditionally, the Digital Production Partnership (DPP) has announced its first PlugFest, which will be collocated with the HPA Tech Retreat UK. Following the publication of the DPP's UHD Specification and the upcoming release of the North American Broadcasters Association (NABA) / DPP Specification, the DPP aims to support the industry's implementation of these specifications through creating test files, feedback and discussion loops. The DPP UHD PlugFest will take place at Heythrop Park, 12 July. Please note that registration for the DPP UHD PlugFest is separate from the HPA event and is managed through DPP at http://www.digitalproductionpartnership.co.uk .\nAdditional programme submissions will be accepted until 30 April, as outlined in earlier announcements. Submissions are accepted at the HPA Tech Retreat UK website. The HPA Tech Retreat UK will take place at Heythrop Park Resort, in Oxfordshire, about 1.5 hours from London, easily accessible by train.

TiVo boxes can also stream video from Internet services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, pulling everything into one unified watch list.\nThe new TiVO Roamio OTA includes 1.0TB of storage, double the amount of the previous version, and can store up to 150 hours of high-definition video. As importantly, the new Roamio OTA comes with lifetime service instead of a mandatory $15-per-month subscription fee. While the up-front cost is higher at $400, compared to $50 for the subscription-based box, lifetime service pays off after a couple years of use.\nThe new Roamio OTA is otherwise similar to its predecessor: It can record up to four recordings at once, and it connects to the Internet via ethernet cable or 802.11n Wi-Fi. Software features includes QuickMode, which speeds up playback by 30 percent with pitch-corrected audio, and SkipMode, which jumps over commercial breaks during certain prime-time programming.\nIt’s still unclear whether TiVo will launch an OTA-only version of its newer Bolt DVR, which has a faster processor, faster 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and built-in transcoding to stream recordings to iOS, Android, and Amazon Fire TV devices. (Roamio DVR owners can add those streaming features with a $130 TiVo Stream accessory.)\nTiVo has offered the Roamio OTA with lifetime service before, but only as limited-time promotions. The new model appears to be a permanent addition to TiVo’s lineup and will be available May 2 through TiVo.com, Best Buy, and Amazon.\nWhy this matters: The TiVo Roamio OTA might have earned a more glowing review from TechHive if not for the mandatory $15-per-month-forever subscription fee. With that downside out of the way, TiVo’s DVR for cord cutters is a much more compelling option. Just keep in mind that the TiVo platform is missing several key streaming services, such as Sling TV , HBO Now, Showtime, and PlayStation Vue , which means it still may not serve as the ultimate box to rule your cable-free living room.\nRelated:\n", "deleted" : false }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5725fcd64a3640000198d403" }, "companyIDs" : [ "trusera" ], "title" : "HealthTap's social network of 5,000 doctors is ready to give free advice", "date" : { "$date" : "2011-09-26T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "URL" : "http://venturebeat.com/2011/09/26/healthtaps-social-network-of-5000-doctors-is-ready-to-give-free-advice/", "content" : "Tags: health technology , HealthTap , social network for doctors\nIt’s fair to raise an eyebrow when a social network for healthcare comes along, but this network just might make you raise both eyebrows in surprise: HealthTap has created a healthcare social network with more than 5,000 real-live doctors to answer patient questions. Not peers, not “experts” and not brands. Health questions aren’t posted for the world to see or comment on. This is a private network between a patient and thousands of doctors.\n“Facebook and Twitter are dangerous for doctors, but everyone wants to take part in social networking,” says HealthTap CEO and founder Ron Gutman, referring to the perils of patient confidentiality and lawsuits for giving wrong advice. Social and medicine haven’t boded well under the shared banner of technology, but Gutman is creating a social environment that works for doctors and patients.\nToday HealthTap is launching a mobile app  (free) called HealthTap Express that lets users ask any health question and get immediate answers from more than 5,000 doctors for free. This isn’t Yahoo Answers or Quora . Questions asked on HealthTap are always answered by a professional held accountable for their answers, which can be reviewed by peers. These are real, North American-based doctors with licenses and contact information.\nGetting these doctors to become part of a social network was no small task. HealthTap began 20 weeks ago (Gutman refers to the time in “weeks,” similar to the way a new parent refers to the age of their child)  as a network for OB/GYNs and pregnant women. This was a smart vertical to tackle first; as many doctors in this field are some of the industry’s most vocal about preventative medicine, patient rights and universal healthcare. Word spread of the network, like it does for all successful social networks, and today HealthTap’s app has grown to incorporate 82 healthcare fields. The app is available for iOS and Android, smartphones and tablets.\nTo help encourage doctors and patients to participate in the network, the app uses gamification elements. Doctors are able to showcase their specialties in a way that cannot be expressed on review sites like Yelp. They are able to show how much they know and lend a bit of their own voice and style to their profiles and answers. They get points and higher visibility the more helpful they are. There’s the potential for doctors to connect with new patients locally and grow their practice.\nMeanwhile, HealthTap patients get free answers to medical questions and can then make the most of doctor-visits. There’s no time wasted, neither the patient’s nor the doctor’s, on general questions. Patients can spend their face-to-face time getting to the root of their medical issues. They can also learn when they can skip a visit or absolutely need to see a doctor. That goes for some of the most embarrassing health questions, too.\n“My teenage daughter suggested I start reaching out to teenagers on MySpace,” says Dr. Jeff Livingston who runs MacArthur OB/GYN in Irving, Texas. He was one of the first physicians in the HealthTap network, but has experimented with social media as a way to help people for more than a decade.\n“We created a page and suddenly kids started asking questions they were embarrassed about asking in person,” says Livingston. “I think we are in the beginning of the social media revolution. It’s not the technology that’s important. It’s patient engagement. You don’t just go online to read something. You go on to interact; to have a dialogue. Doctors are trying to figure out their social media presence, but we haven’t yet connected the dots.”\nConnecting the dots between health and tech hasn’t been easy. This year search and social network giant Google shut down its health records project  called Google Health. Social networks for health have struggled to gain acceptance or have failed all together. For example, Trusera shut down in 2009 , a year after it go started. Its problem was lack of funding and the shaky foundation of peer-to-peer medical advice (not expert).\nHealthcare accounts for almost 1/5 of the United States’ GDP and has been troubled and regulated to the extent that only the most experienced entrepreneurs can cut through the thicket. The cost to entering the industry has been to high, but the potential rewards are higher.\nAngel investors are getting more interested in health tech. Esther Dyson, a renowned angel investor, is backing HealthTap. She has also invested in 23andMe and Medstory (sold to Microsoft). Venture capitalists are also starting to invest in health tech, i.e. not just health companies or tech companies.\n“We’ve invested in both healthcare and technology and done very well,” says Patrick Chung, a partner at venture capital firm NEA . “But there wasn’t a melding. There was a healthcare investment team and an IT investment team. In the last two to three years we’ve been seeing exciting hybrids of the two.”\nChung says entrepreneurs are now “casting their eyes to the giant, ailing patient of healthcare” and points to companies like 23andMe that have successfully navigated healthcare regulation and carved a path for information that can be acted upon. Lots of smart people are jumping on this bandwagon.\n“All good venture capitalists should follow the talent,” says Chung. “The most promising entrepreneurs had not yet gotten into this space. There weren’t a lot of health IT startups period. But now some of the most promising, high-energy entrepreneurs are getting into it.”\nAI. Messaging. Bots.

The MLSs are more or less run by the real estate agents, and they didn't like the idea of being rated. So they got together at a national convention, and magically, AHRN suddenly started getting inundated with nearly identical legal nastygrams, alleging copyright infringement in the data that NeighborCity posted from those MLS systems.\nWe found the copyright claims somewhat bizarre, because most of the information clearly is factual data, not subject to copyright. Similarly, the photographs, where there might be some level of weak copyright, should belong to the real estate agents. A few years ago, recognizing this, however, the various MLSs rejiggered their setup to require that agents click an online agreement stating that the MLS co-owns the copyright. This still seems highly questionable, though, as we'll discuss below, the courts seem to be buying that these are valid copyrights. AHRN, however, hit back with a variety of counterclaims, arguing a variety of things, including copyright misuse, but also saying that there was clear evidence of an antitrust violation, because of the coordinated effort by the different attendees of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) conference and the various MLSs. There's even something of a smoking gun email, in which the President of one of the MLSs, RMLS, sent an email to his lawyer, suggesting coordinated action against AHRN and its CEO Jonathan Cardella:\nAcross the country, multiple MLS’s have howled about the injustice of it all, wagged their fingers at Mr. Cardella, called in the full force and fury of their respective legal advisors, dropped C&D’s on the head of the bad fellow with the same effect as confetti and then we all shut down for the holidays.\nIf I were Mr. Cardella, I’d be thinking that we (the offended parties) are unconnected, unserious and more noise than threat. Ask Brian about the French guards in Monty Python and The Holy Grail as they rain insults down on Arthur.\nIf we don’t have the standing to enforce the copyright as anticipated in the Access and License Agreements of those of our Participants who assigned us an interest for the very purpose defined by Neighborcity.com, what is the point of them?\nHow do we connect the dots between all of the MLS’s that have been abused so that we can act collectively, either in cost sharing and/or strategically by taking an action against Mr. Cardella that has the desired outcomes of:\n1. Getting all of our listings off of his site\n2. Discovering where he has been getting the listings\n3. Throwing a world of hurt on both\n4. Sending a message that our copyrights are enforceable and we are serious about punishing anyone who doesn’t take us seriously\nThere are two very similar cases here. One is taking place in Maryland involving the Metropolitan Regional Information Systems Inc. (MRIS) and another in Minnesota involving the Regional Multiple Listing Service of Minnesota (RMLS, also known as NorthStarMLS). It was the head of RMLS who wrote that rather damning email above. In the Maryland case, things are not going well. The court recently granted MRIS's motion to dismiss , finding that the copyright claims are likely legit, and not buying the antitrust claims -- though, with at least some of them it is allowing AHRN to refile to correct deficiencies in the claims. However, it seems quite skeptical, arguing in part that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine allows the parties to team up in matters of litigation. While there is an exception to the doctrine if organizations are teaming up for \"sham litigation,\" the court disagreed that the litigation was a sham.\nTo summarize, MRIS and NAR’s litigation and related activities are immunized from antitrust liability. With respect to the other factual allegations in the First Amended Counterclaims, AHRN has failed to outline the contours of an agreement and has failed to explain how Counterclaim-Defendants’ alleged conduct affected competition generally. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the § 1 claims in the First Amended Counterclaims. In light of the deficiencies identified herein, the Court has serious reservations about AHRN’s ability to set forth a cognizable Sherman Act claim against either Counterclaim-Defendant. However, AHRN set forth in its proposed Second Amended Counterclaims some allegations which may be relevant to its § 1 claims, including its claim for fraud on the Copyright Office. See Doc. No. 133-1. Accordingly, in the interest of justice, the Court will grant AHRN leave to file amended counterclaims and attempt to cure the deficiencies outlined above.\nThat's unfortunate. However, up in Minnesota things are looking slightly better for AHRN. While that court also found some of the copyrights to be valid, and dinged AHRN with a finding of contempt for supposedly violating an injunction barring the posting of RMLS' copyrighted photos, it also finds the antitrust arguments a lot more compelling. Unlike the Maryland court, the Minnesota court agrees that the whole effort may be a sham, and questions whether or not all of RMLS's claimed copyrights are really legit.\nIn this case, the Court finds that AHRN has sufficiently alleged that RMLS’s petitioning activities were a sham. For example, AHRN alleges that, in the instant action, RMLS has asserted a copyright over the manner in which the facts and data are compiled on NorthstarMLS, even though the RMLS database is built on software RMLS did not design and does not own. AHRN also alleges that RMLS did not take the photographs over which it claims copyrights, and that it did not obtain the written assignments of these copyrights from the photographers that are required under the Copyright Act. These allegations, if true, could show that RMLS’s threats and pursuit of litigation against AHRN were in fact a sham.\nAnd while the Maryland Court found the Sherman antitrust claims almost impossible to justify, the court in Minnesota recognizes what's really going on here:\nThe Court finds that AHRN’s counterclaim provides a “suggestion of a preceding agreement” and thus satisfies the Twombly standard for alleging a conspiracy among RMLS, other MLSs, and the NAR. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-67. First, AHRN alleges that it received thirty similar cease and desist letters after NAR held its annual meeting in California. AHRN alleges that, at this meeting, there were discussions regarding the perceived threat that AHRN posed to the industry and what the industry could do to shut down AHRN. These allegations create a plausible relationship between the NAR meeting and the cease and desist letters. Second, AHRN alleges that Mosey sent an e-mail suggesting that AHRN should not think that MLSs were “unconnected, unserious, and more noise than threat.” This e-mail could further suggest an agreement between RMLS and other MLSs. Third, AHRN alleges that NAR voted at a later meeting to fund this action and other legal actions and adopted exclusionary rules. This allegation further supports the possibility of an agreement to pursue concerted action. Fourth, when AHRN approached third-party syndicators – through whom RMLS and other MLSs license the use of their data to other websites – it was allegedly told that the syndicators were not permitted to extend a license to AHRN because AHRN did not direct potential home buyers to a listing broker’s website. This allegation also raises the possibility of an agreement to pursue concerted action by suggesting that RMLS and other MLSs may have instructed third-party syndicators not to deal with companies who did not comply with their preferred business model. At this stage, the Court therefore finds that AHRN has sufficiently alleged a preceding agreement to engage in concerted action.\nThe court also finds it compelling that so many real estate brokers refused attempts by AHRN to license their listings, suggesting that there was a group effort, or a group boycott, designed for anticompetitive purposes.\nThese two cases are fairly important. As we've discussed at length, the ability of traditional gatekeepers to use highly questionable copyright claims, solely for the purpose of stifling innovation and disruptive startups, is a really worrisome trend. However, for the most part, they've been able to get away with it. In this case, the actions and the intention of the MLSs are abundantly clear. They're obviously not using copyright here as an \"incentive\" to create. They're using it to try to restrict the free flow of information concerning home buying, and to limit and block innovative services they dislike, such as NeighborCity, for daring to present ratings on real estate agents.\nWhile the ruling in Maryland is unfortunate, it's good to see that the judge in Minnesota is at least open to this line of reasoning. The eventual ruling in these cases, and any later appeals, could become very important in future battles concerning legacy players abusing copyright to try to shut down disruptive upstart competitors.\n", "deleted" : false }

This past weekend, the annual Long Beach Soundwalk took place across the blocks of downtown Long Beach’s art district. Coordinated by the efforts of local artist group FLOOD, the 8th annual Soundwalk saw a mix of local and international artists working with a multitude of art mediums, seemingly random materials, and technology (we ARE TechZulu after all) to create a highly interactive multi-playered experience in a new and (somewhat) abstract space.\n*whew*\nNot having been to a Soundwalk before, I immediately knew we were in for a unique experience when we turned the corner and heard a slightly spooky modulated voice directing me to: “tell the universe [pause] your wish”. From requests of world peace, to the next iPhone 5 to be revealed soon (sorry Miss, your wish didn’t quite come to fruition), all put through midi controllers and sound modulators so that everyone’s voice outputs were of a Greek deity quality (with plenty of echo effects), it was a fun way to kick off our Soundwalk.\nThe complete lineup of exhibits, performances, and installs ranged from sculptures to interactive exhibits to performances made strong consistent use of technology, which for some reason just didn’t really occur to me as a main theme (as I assumed non-powered objects and instruments would be the focus point). But once I really thought about it, perhaps a Soundwalk from another decade would be characterized by totally ‘natural’ sounds, but as generation of people who has lived with technology deeply ingrained into our lives, it only made sense that technology would play such a large role in the art show. The result for Soundwalk was a very organic-tech experience, with instruments and normal objects as the base supplemented by midi controllers, sound modulators, phase shifters, and digital reverberators of all kinds.\nI really enjoyed experiencing:\n-Gil Kuno’s “Slinky Piece”, a metal ladder that projected loopy echos and clinks through a soundboard and producing amplified noises made from a slinky falling down each rung (the kids really loved this one)\n-The tech-savvy “Arduino”, a jellyfish art piece that employed a 48 hold hemisphere that registered object presence and synced sounds and LED lights to the movements of the user\n-Pedestal and the All Girl Band with their guerilla style karaoke assaults and crowd participation oriented brand of comedy and merrymaking\n-Clowns and Fetuses and their black light fueled gallery for the macabre and the tripped\nOne of my favorites (couldn’t find the sign for it) took place in a completely blacked out room, where ambient sounds played from the four corners of the room. The artists provided exhibit participants an iPad with a custom-designed soundboard with a number of pre-loaded sounds with volume and activate capabilities. The experience, with eyes closed, was just astonishing as you were able to distinctly pinpoint the movement and positioning of different audio tracks.\nIn the end, the event was much different than I had originally anticipated, much less of a music focus than I had originally thought, and a bit more abstract. And I believe, this level of abstract thought and creativity really gave the pieces a lot of meaning; while one could easily dismiss a piece in an “I don’t get it” moment, there was a lot of great thought put behind each piece as the artists were oftentimes on hand and happy to describe thought processes and meaning behind their works.\nThe final result, an interesting stroll through Downtown Long Beach with ambient sounds hitting our ears from all sides, able to provide you just enough of what was going on with each exhibit to draw you closer and explore. Really neat stuff.\nAnd we also managed to catch up with a few of the event coordinators (Kamran Assadi, Shelley RuggThorp, and Marco Schindelmann) from FLOOD and get some insight into the long-running Soundwalk some more!\nSo how did Soundwalk come about? It’s a pretty unique concept!\nThe whole idea of developing the arts district in cities to raise community value has been done all over, LA, New York, etc. and some people wanted to do it here as well. They tried to, but our arts district had nothing substantive here. A few boutiques, but no conventional exhibition spaces. The idea was to bring real art to the district, so we thought, why not sound? Sound doesn’t require a lot of finite space, it’s very flexible and fluid, so it’s a versatile medium.\nHow have you gone about obtaining the artists?\nSound artists are a smaller tight-knit group of people. There’s a great program at Cal-Art as well. It started off with, 30-40 people, and the list has just grew organically. The database is pretty extensive now with local artists, nation-wide, and international artists. This year (with the help of Nick Dynice ) we’ve really made an effort to showcase the artists regularly on our Facebook and website with profiles leading up to the show.\nPlease tell me a little bit about FLOOD and the walk\nWe’re an artists collective and we do a number of different projects, not just Soundwalk. Different installations, conceptual projects, and happenings. We’re not a one trick pony, maybe a two trick pony :). One thing to pay mind to is that for most places, an art walk’s purpose is to provide a space for artists to show and sell their work. With how these sound exhibits are done and performed, it’s all about experiencing. No one is really selling their work.\nOne thing I noticed was the emphasis on ambient sound rather than music. Any insight into this?\nIt’s definitely not a music event. There’s plenty of those already. It’s not just that we want to differentiate, but that it IS a different kind of event. Music can be a component, but it’s not the focal point. Also, some people do just show up to play or exhibit their work.\n*Marco Schindlemann joins us for dinner*\nMarco, great of you to join us, anything you could tell us more about the Soundwalk?\nThis is what we do. Sound art is all about democratic listening. Music is very hierarchical, with a lot of structure in keys, notes, etc. As a result, when music is written and produced, it is very much about what the composer wants the listeners to hear. With sound art, it’s very much about  what the listener chooses to tune in to.  We regard Soundwalk a huge success when participants will start listening to objects they think might be an exhibit, but really aren’t. *laughs*.\nAnother distinction to make is that with music, it is about “us” knowing what the artist is expressing or feeling as opposed to sound artists are interested in what spectators and listeners are feeling. So you start to see how poets and other artists start to look at the world. In the end, that’s the important thing. In the future, all the artist will have to do is point. The artist will point, and we, the spectator or auditor will be able to appreciate what the artist sees or feels.\nThanks so much everyone, we at TechZulu really appreciate your time!\nTim Wut\nTim Wut was once in pursuit of a paper-laden career in bankruptcy law.

The new algo, going by the name Hummingbird, was designed for the new, mobile age . Built to interpret “conversational” search queries, and supposedly to look for meanings over keywords, Hummingbird signaled a new direction for the search engine.\nFor marketers hoping to leverage the visibility that Google can bring, this was mixed news. What are search engine optimizers supposed to optimize for, if not for keywords? Was Google pressuring small businesses and start ups to turn to AdWords instead of SEO? That message seemed particularly on-point, considering that just a few days before, Google announced that they would shut off all keyword data to webmasters .\nFor SEOs, the change should hardly have been unexpected. For the past two years, Google had been revamping its algorithm with external “Panda” and “Penguin” updates, designed to target low quality and spammy search results. Over and over, companies were discovering that Google didn’t view search engine manipulation as a legitimate form of marketing.\nSo that’s it, right? Search engines are just too volatile. Gaming them is a dangerous gamble. Expecting free traffic is a bad business model. Let’s pick up our bags and do some real marketing, am I right guys?\nOnly that’s not it. Because it turns out that if you don’t have a future in the search engines, you probably don’t have a future at all.\nLet’s talk about why, and what you can do about that.\nThe Little Startup That Couldn’t\nIn 2009, an ambitious startup co-founder named Mark Goldenson shared a story with VentureBeat . It was a story of failure.\nGoldenson and Dev Nag hoped to create an interactive online TV network called PlayCafe. Users would answer questions, win prizes, and run their own games. It would become a series of game shows that everybody took part in. Their user engagement metrics were incredible. Users stayed onboard an average of 87 minutes, and nearly half would return every week.\nYet PlayCafe was a failure. They never reached a wide enough audience. Goldenson cited marketing as their biggest pitfall, including SEO specifically.\nMark Goldenson is now CEO of Breakthrough , an app that links patients with mental health experts, and one that raised $5 million in series A funding. Not surprisingly, it turns up on the front page of Google when you search for “online counseling” or “online therapy.”\nI’m not arguing that Breakthrough is a success because it shows up in Google for these terms. I am, however, arguing that if it didn’t show up by now, it probably wouldn’t have much of a future.\nAccording to research conducted by Fleishman-Hillard , 89 percent of consumers turn to search engines to find information about products, services, or businesses before they open their wallet. With a smartphone in every pocket, that number is growing, and it’s influencing the way that people shop, even as they walk through physical stores.\nBut turning up in Google isn’t just a way to reach consumers before they make a purchase. In many cases, it’s also a sign that your long term marketing strategies are working. Google measures links from sites as an indication of your authority, and it takes links from major media outlets far more seriously than it takes links from no-name sites. Furthermore, Google factors in the influence of user search behavior, clicks, and so on, to determine whether your site deserves to show up near the top of their results.\nHummingbird, the new engine under Google’s hood, takes this one step further. By attempting to interpret the meaning behind search queries, Google is ultimately sending more users away from small sites with keyword-targeted titles, and toward big sites with engaged audiences, media appeal, and repeat traffic.\nIn other words, Google rankings today are a chicken-and-the-egg phenomenon. Whether the rankings come first or last, if they don’t come at all, you’re probably going to lose.\nWhat Successful SEO Looks Like\nMoz, an SEO tool company, has one of the largest web indexes owned by a company other than a search engine. Sporting 7 Billion domains and 109 Billion pages, Moz analyzes the links between these pages, along with other factors, to help SEOs orchestrate and measure their campaigns.\nLeveraging this data, they publicly offer up a list of the top 500 most linked-to domains on the web . A quick look at the top ten is revealing:\nFacebook\n", "deleted" : false }

The site design is intuitive and pleasing, and once more people start adding their ratings, tips, and tags, it will become more useful. My biggest quibble is that if TripSay’s search engine cannot find a place (like teh Gramercy Tavern restaurant in New York City), there is no way to add it so that it appears on the map. But you can add it as a tip, and link to a blog post about it if you like.  And, in general, the search is pretty good. (Update: It turns out you can add a place by simply clicking on a map, but you have to discover that for yourself. It would help if they somehow made that clearer. Update 2: The business model, which I should have mentioned, is highly-targeted travel-related ads and affiliate fees to travel booking sites).\nTravel, by its nature, is normally a very social experience. Most of us need help from other humans when we are in a strange place. TripSay joins a whole new group of social travel sites that are now emerging , such as Driftr , HereOrThere , and YowTrip . It also adds elements of guided vertical search like Uptake (formerly Kango). Travel sites that don’t make social connections a central part of their experience will have to continue to compete on more utilitarian grounds such as price and place discovery. And that is a very competitive business. The new social travel sites will compete not so much on how good their pricing data is, but rather on how knowledgeable their community is. Which social travel would you want to be a part of?\n", "deleted" : false }

According to Mary Hodder, Chairman of Dabble, “recommendation and discovery is 80% of the problem.”\nNo one is denying the video explosion and fragmentation underway. In October 2006, there were approximately 100 million video viewings online, with over half seen through YouTube. Today, by contrast, about a quarter of all videos are viewed on YouTube, and online consumption has grown to 300 million total views monthly.\nIn response, Dabble and its competitors are adapting their approaches to content management. How the results are organized, clustered and presented is important. Tim Tuttle, who serves as the CEO of Truveo (owned by AOL), explained that, “we want to make it possible for you to find video every time you want it…[and] it’s hard to solve this problem.” According to Alex Vikati, president of castTV, “the lines between search, discovery and browse are a little fuzzy.”\nTuttle says that a focused approach is also important, and Truveo “goes to all [key] places, including media companies and major content producers.” Vikati feels that, “it’s not just size, but comprehensiveness” that matters. He believes that premium content is important, but classifying spam and other poor quality results should be addressed first.  Bearing in mind how many videos are ephemeral, there has been significant progress made by providers in de-duping and updating search results.\nAdditionally, search vendors are working with new outputs from video sharing and social environments. They have taken advantage of user metadata, like commentary, surrounding the videos. While I do think the answer lies somewhere in the social arena, text surrounding the videos seems a bit askew – comments may not actually be very insightful or even related to the video subjects.\nA better approach to discovery? It’s telling that when NewTeeVee attendees were asked to vote on the best Video Search provider, they crowned StumbleUpon as the winner! Founder Garrett Camp doesn’t focus exclusively on video but rather anything interesting on the web. His business helps people share what’s intriguing to them. Heresy? Perhaps. But clearly the answer isn’t about old-school search.\nRelated reading\n", "deleted" : false }

Yes, it doesn’t sound like much, but Stone also said that the company is named after the jellyfish, which sheds light on the type of application he might be working on:\nWe are inspired by this particular animal because neurologically, its brain is more “we” than “me.” Also, for the past 700 million years, this decentralized structure has been wildly successful.\nTo us, it sounds like Jellyfish might have something to do with social good, or helping others out. By calling out the “we” vs. “me” aspect, it’s clear that Stone won’t be working on another social network that lets you express yourself in 140 characters, set up a bio or otherwise peacock about how amazing you are and why you’re interesting, all over the Internet.\nDoing “good” is another ballgame, though.\nYou might be a generous person trying to change the world for the better, but can you prove it? Jelly sounds to us like a way to connect you to social causes and show off your contributions. The Twitter co-founder explained that “People are basically good—when provided a tool that helps them do good in the world, they prove it.”\nThe service will be free, but won’t be available for “a while.” Additionally, Stone says that Jelly will be taking up a good part of his time, save for some of his advisory roles at companies like Branch and Fluther. Jelly is self-funded and based in San Francisco. Much like Ev Williams’ publishing service Medium , Stone is in no hurry to become a big company he says.\nThere aren’t many central homes for philanthropy and volunteering on the web other than a site like Causes, which piggybacked Facebook’s success and open graph. The site never took off as a standalone service, lacking helpful discovery tools to connect you with causes that you might care about.\nFor the most part, you donate here, sign a petition there, but there’s no scorecard. If you had a public-facing profile highlighting your positive actions, you might do more good for the world and inspire others to, as well. It’s too early to ride the speculation train on Jelly, but if Biz Stone wants to do some good in the world, it will be an interesting story to watch unfold.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

See what you want to see!\nOr follow me on facebook, twitter, and google+ and request, comment, chat with me.\nAbout What We Do\nPersonal Finance\n     Money. It seems to be everywhere but in our pockets these days. It doesn't matter if your a college student like me or a hard working mother of 4; money is always an issue. So how can we keep track of our money and pinch every last penny that we've worked hard for? Simple, an app that runs smoothly and covers all the financial bases no matter who you are. \n     This week I've spent countless hours using finance apps on the App Store for Apple products. If you search for one of these apps, you find that personal finance apps are broken up into different types. You have budget apps, accounting apps, receipt apps, and it keeps going. Now most of these apps cost money for a full version although many have more than great \"lite\" versions that will subdue the needs for one of these apps. I found in using many of these apps that they all had one, or two, maybe even three of the features that people often look for; but why can't we have all of what we want in one place? Well I didn't spend all that time and data to not find out!\nFirst off is the runner up:\n     Intuit's \"Mint\"\nThe reason I chose this to be a very close second place is the linking of a bank account. If you loose your phone that's just one more thing that you have to worry about. Allthough the biggest thing for me was that my bank showed up in the app but wasn't able to connect. I had emailed customer service and within a week...no I didn't get it fixed nor did I even get a sympathetic automated reply. I got nothing. So I used a different phone with a different bank (a friend's) and flipped through the app. It was decent if your bank account syncs except budgets are just set up funky and are overall difficult to setup. \nThe winner of Everyday personal finance:\n     Maxwell Software's \"Money Monitor\"\n \n          THIS APP HAS IT ALL! \nThis app, first off, has every feature that anyone asked for. On top of having it all, the interface is extremely easy to use, which is good because at first glance you must enter all your financial info by hand. Want you account number on the app? No problem. Don't? No problem. The money monitor is flexible, in every aspect; the app allows for users to customize nearly everything except the color of the app. You can add as many payees, accounts, bills, budgets, transfers, ect. as you please (only on, reasonably priced, full app). But wait there's more! Need to see where your money is going to see where you can pinch those pennies? Not a problem with the monitor; it gives you pie charts that can be broken down into anything on the app as shown below.\n     Still not convinced thst this app is the easiest to use Everyday App for personal finance? Well how about automatic bill pay that is a breeze to setup, and any transaction can be put on auto repeat. Don't be scared that you'll forget if a bill is on auto pay, it utilizes an alarm and reminder feature! This app also comes with a password lock to keep thieves or nosey family members out and money safe. Last but not least, it has an extremely quick and easy transaction interface that keeps you moving on with your day and keeps you up to date on where your money is and who it's with.\nIf your still not convinced check out the lite version of the app, as it will speak for itself.\nMoney Monitor Lite:\nWell that was another segment from Everyday App Review, hope you enjoyed and feel free to comment. \nHAVE AN APP TOPIC YOU WANT REVIEWS FOR???\n    Shoot me a message on my google+ with all the info you want.\n", "deleted" : false }

Frequently though, those links are time-consuming to add and usually end up sending the reader to another website to actually make a purchase.\nCosmic Cart , which is launching today as part of the Disrupt NY Startup Battlefield, wants to make shopping on sites easier both for the publisher and for the reader.\nIt does this by giving publishers a drop-dead simple tool for adding items that can be purchased online. And for readers, it embeds the shopping cart and purchasing flow directly on the publisher site, so there’s no clicking through to other websites to actually make a purchase.\nThe main purpose behind Cosmic Cart is to make adding purchasable retail items ultra-simple for publishers. It’s meant to increase the speed with which they can add commerce to their sites, while also boosting conversions.\nThe first part of Cosmic Cart’s magic comes on the publisher side, where the company has built an easy tool for publishers to instantly tag items that are available for sale.\nThe technology can automatically scan the page and add items that are available for purchase through one of its retail partners. Cosmic Cart also has a browser extension that enables publishers to easily click on images, search and add items themselves.\nFor readers, Cosmic Cart also drastically simplifies the purchase process. Instead of being ushered to a retailer website, where you then have to add an item to a shopping cart, as well as fill out shipping and billing information before purchasing, Cosmic Cart puts a purchasing widget on the publisher’s page.\nOnce you’ve signed up, you can simply add an item to your cart and check out directly there. It can also save your information so you can make purchases from any Cosmic Cart-powered website without the hassle of filling forms out each time.\nShipping and fulfillment is ultimately handled by the retailer, but the entire process ends up being transparent to the user. In fact, customers can add multiple items to the cart from different retailers, but they won’t even know that at checkout.\nBy doing so, Cosmic Cart can massively increase the conversion rates for what used to be affiliate links to outside retailer sites. “We’re providing a better user experience,” Cosmic Cart CEO Alex Adelman said.\nIt also provides more data to retailers about what’s actually selling to consumers. By doing that, they can ensure that both sides know what’s popular and how to improve.\nThat’s got both retailers and publishers excited: On the retail side, Cosmic Cart has partnered with Target, Alternative Apparel, Zirna Zabete, Marissa Collections, Heels.com, Cooking.com, and Bags.com, among others. And publishers like Refinery 29, Federated Media, and\nMode Media have signed up.\njudge-guy\n", "deleted" : false }

In the first half of 2015, this figure amounted to 204,300 units. Affected by lower oil prices, the sales volume of electric vehicles in Japan and the United States declined while that in China and Europe maintained faster growth. \nIn 2014, the global demand for Li-ion power battery for electric vehicles came to 9.8GWh, up 87% from a year earlier, of which the demand from passenger vehicles totaled 7.3GWh and commercial vehicles 2.5GWh. In H1 2015, the global demand for EV Li-ion power battery hit 7GWh, maintaining high growth \nAt present, manganese-series power battery, including NCM and LMO, occupies the mainstream status on a global scale, with the cost of battery packs generally standing at USD400-550/kWh, which reflects an obvious decline since 2014. The cylindrical NCA 18650 battery produced through coiling, though lower costs for its cells, is popular with automakers due to high BMS costs and safety; Similarly, because of poor comprehensive performance, low-cost LFP battery is only is used in China and the United States. However, the US automakers have gradually abandoned LFP batteries and turned to ternary materials-based and Mn-series batteries from Japanese and S. Korean companies. When it comes to the development trends in Li-ion power battery technology, passenger vehicles will mainly adopt manganese series and ternary materials-based batteries while commercial vehicles will primarily use LFP batteries and gradually turn to ternary materials-based batteries. \nAt present, no major technological breakthrough has not yet been made in power battery. It is estimated that the drop in prices for power battery mainly resulted from a fall in the costs of raw materials and economies of scale, but with a limited decline. \nIn 2014, China's power battery shipments totaled 3.7GWH, up 470% from a year earlier. Among them, the demand for passenger vehicle power batteries was 1.6GWh and that for commercial vehicles 2.1GWh. In H1 2015, China's power battery shipments came to 2.72GWh. As battery electric buses showed explosive growth in the second half of 2015, and if we calculate the new energy vehicle output based on 250,000 units for the full year, the corresponding battery demand will reach 11 GWh. \nAs far as Chinese Li-ion power battery manufacturers are concerned, in H1 2015, any of such companies as BYD, Guoxuan, ATL, Tianjin Lishen, OptimumNano, Boston Power, and Pride Battery has a battery output of 100MWH. The shipments of 13 major battery manufacturers accounted for an aggregate 71% in market share, of which BYD had the largest market share of 17%. \nFrom the perspective of global trends, the support from big carmakers is vital to power battery manufacturers. Traditional consumer electronics companies are aggressively conducting transformation. On the other hand, battery materials manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers have also begun to enter this field through various ways. Thus, the first echelon represented by BYD, Guoxuan, Tianjin Lishen, and ATL and the second echelon including OptimumNano, Boston Power, and Pride Battery, BESK, Do-Fluoride Chemicals, CALB, and Shenzhen BAK have taken shape. \nKey Topics Covered: \n1.

Motorola's been trying to streamline that with its 4Home standard and the company's latest attempt at smarthome synchronicity has just been unveiled. It's called the Connected Home Gateway and it looks like your average wireless router, but it's actually much more than that -- according to Moto's press release, anyway, which promises the thing can easily tie together home security, automation and climate control into a single, petite box. Once harmonized, the whole package is said to be easily accessible from a mobile device, something that might help homeowners relax a bit more while on vacation -- or while covering a major convention in Las Vegas. We're still lacking a lot of details here (like, how exactly do all these devices connect to the thing) but we'll try to get a demo and more details as soon as possible.\nShow full PR text\nMotorola Mobility Simplifies Convergence with Connected Home Innovations at CES 2012\nThe new connected consumer lifestyle is on display at Motorola (LVCC Central Hall, Booth No. 8644)\nJan. 05, 2012\nHORSHAM, Pa. – Jan. 5, 2012 –At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, Motorola Mobility (NYSE: MMI) is making the Smart Home simple-with the introduction of the Connected Home Gateway. Key innovations from Motorola's Home division – including Televation™, DCX3600 video gateway, DreamGallery, SocialTV, and SecureMedia – are also driving the evolution of television, making it easier for consumers to enjoy and discover new programming, tap into social features, and access content on multiple devices, both at home and on the go.\nThe new Motorola Connected Home Gateway – the latest embodiment of Motorola's 4Home platform –is a CES 2012 Innovations Honoree for outstanding design and engineering. This honor continues Motorola's unbroken streak of product awards for 4Home innovations at CES.\n\"People want anywhere, anytime access to their digital lives. Our suite of award-winning products addresses the new ways that people are embracing their connected lifestyle in the home,\" said Dan Moloney, president, Motorola Mobility. \"We're seeing more consumption of more media and lifestyle services across more devices. This is an unprecedented opportunity for service providers to differentiate by streamlining these converged experiences. At CES, Motorola is showcasing a range of new products that are paving the way for the next stage of the connected home.\"\nIntroducing the Connected Home Gateway\nIt's not enough for people to control their TV and other aspects of their digital lives in the home. They also want control of the home as well, from anywhere they may be. More connected devices being added to the home network means more complexity, both for the consumer and the service provider.\nEnter Motorola's new Connected Home Gateway: the connected home, in a box. Powerful processing and 4Home technology come together to deliver the connected home the way it was meant to be: smart and simple.\nAdding connected home services – such as home control, home security and energy management – has never been easier for consumers and service providers, thanks to the Motorola Connected Home Gateway, which handles the complexity of today's home networks as well as the traditional obstacles of service installation and maintenance. All consumers have to do is plug in the gateway, and the unit automatically connects their home control devices to the home network.\nNow, with just the push of a button, the devices in the home can be paired wirelessly and connected to the cloud for remote management on a host of devices. And connected home services can be added, managed and troubleshot on the fly.\nThis is achieved with a powerful 1.2 GHz processor running Motorola's open 4Home software platform, which supports and abstracts a host of standards and protocols, hiding the complexity of multiple disparate devices on the home network. It also allows consumers to access their homes remotely, from a smartphone, tablet or PC. And a robust back-end architecture combined with Motorola's on-board EDGE™ Service Assurance software lets service providers deliver support, proactive quality assurance and service activation in real-time, meaning faster, and more efficient customer service.\nAll this in a single box. The Motorola Connected Home Gateway is the closest thing to plug and play for the connected home.\nThe Evolution of Television\nThe Internet is changing the way we watch television. Television is no longer a one-way activity. It's an interactive, community-driven experience. And this experience has expanded far beyond the television set.\nA recent Motorola study found that more than 69 percent of people, globally, watch TV on a device other than their television.\nAt CES 2012, Motorola is showcasing new solutions that bring TV up to Internet speed: giving you a smart, streamlined way to enjoy a personalized TV experience and relevant social features from your smartphone, PC or tablet.\nTelevation: TV Beyond the TV\nLive TV streaming on tablets, anywhere in and around the home. Motorola's Televation – winner of Light Reading's Leading Light Award, Communications Technology's Platinum Award, and a Broadband Technology Report Diamond Award – addresses consumer demand for high-quality TV experiences beyond the tube.\nTelevation, by Motorola, lets consumers watch live TV on their tablets, anywhere in the home. It's the only solution that delivers a full cable subscription onto the tablet, wirelessly. And it's the only one that lets you watch whatever show you want – vs. simply streaming what's playing in the living room. No more competing for what channel to play on your tablet. You get all your regular channels, whenever you want.\nSmall to mid-sized operators can also use the hosted client Televation app to streamline set-up costs and time-to-market.\nTelevation and its hosted client app work with Motorola XOOM and DROID XYBOARD by Motorola tablets, as well as tablets from other manufacturers.\nAdvanced Video Gateway: Making the Shift to IP\nMotorola's DCX3600 IP Video Gateway marks the set-top's evolution into the entertainment hub of the home. This advanced video gateway enables a truly connected home environment by merging traditional broadcast TV with new IP-based content and capabilities for whole-home media distribution across multiple screens. Consumers can view, record or play video on any networked device, in any room, seamlessly.\nAt CES 2012, Motorola will be demonstrating the IP Connected Home experience of tomorrow – with the DCX3600 distributing video to a variety of connected devices, including an IP set-top, DROID RAZR by Motorola smartphone, DROID XYBOARD by Motorola tablet and PS3™ gaming console.\nThe more content that comes into our homes, the more likely it will be across multiple screens. While today's networks are designed to deliver content separately on PCs, smartphones, tablets and television, the IP future of tomorrow will demand greater seamless convergence.\nWith future consumers and networks in mind, the DCX3600 maximizes today's network infrastructure while providing flexibility for an IP tomorrow – which is why it was recently honored with a Broadband Technology Report Diamond Award.\nDreamGallery: Innovation at Internet Speeds\nConsumers have expressed a desire for a richer experience when it comes to finding their favorite programming and discovering new TV content. With the end user in mind, Motorola's DreamGallery is an on-screen experience that revolutionizes the user experience for next-generation TV. DreamGallery makes the experience of finding shows, movies and sports on TV as easy as on the Internet.\nDreamGallery is cloud-based and designed in HTML5, so service providers can deliver new, customized and branded experiences nearly instantaneously-like updating a Web page-dramatically reducing time-to-scale and development cycles.\nDreamGallery also will enable TV providers to deliver the first consistent on-screen experience across multiple devices. Soon, you'll be able to enjoy the same video experience on your TV, tablet and smartphone!\nShaw Communications, Canada's largest cable operator, will be the first in North America to offer consumers the DreamGallery experience, which has already gained wide acclaim in Europe.\nSecureMedia: Advanced Content Protection\nSecuring content and ensuring that it is sent only to the devices for which it is intended becomes much more complex in the multi-screen world. Service providers face a matrix of different adaptive streaming formats, security technologies, and video playback applications to reach a range of consumer devices.\nMotorola's SecureMedia Encryptonite ONE™ HLS+ streamlines the entire content processing and delivery process for multi-screen applications – while ensuring the protection of digital rights and the security of the content streams. This robust system complies with the latest Hollywood studio secure-delivery specifications for multi-screen applications.\nSecureMedia's advanced content protection works across platforms, including IPTV, to secure content in all its forms, now and in the future.\nSocial and Interactive TV\nIn a recent Motorola poll, half of Americans surveyed said they'd like a service that merges their social media habits with TV viewing.\nMotorola's SocialTV Companion Service puts a dashboard of social applications at subscribers' fingertips, on their smartphone or tablet, with content that's customized to the programs they're watching. TV viewing is augmented through interactive games, applications, live chat, and social networking feeds presented on these companion screens – making TV more engaging.\nVISIT MOTOROLA\nTo see how Motorola is redefining every element of the Home Ecosystem – and empowering operators to deliver more – visit Motorola at CES (Booth No. 8644 located in LVCC Central Hall).

Verizon launched its Home Monitoring and Control service today which runs on Motorola Mobility's recently acquired 4Home technology. This is the final form of what the company demonstrated last year — it uses both Z-Wave and Wi-Fi for communications and does all the normal home automation tricks. The system lets you view camera feeds, lock doors, control lights, and manage your thermostat remotely through a PC or smartphone. You can also track your energy usage and get automatic event notifications so you know when the kids get home. The service is available now for $9.99 per month, but it requires Verizon broadband service, a home network, and one of the hardware kits starting at $69.99.\nHome automation has been around for years now with names like Control4, HAI, Insteon, Z-Wave, and Zigbee; maybe you're familiar with these, but chances are most people aren't. Motorola and Verizon are household names that can present a package the Joneses are more likely to adopt. And it could get a third pillar of recognition since Google will automatically get 4Home when it swallows Motorola Mobility. Come to think of it, it isn't surprising that Android @ Home doesn't seem to be going anywhere.\n", "deleted" : false }

Today, the company acquired  Penguin Digital , the New York-based creator of the popular “ MoPho ” app.\nTerms of the deal were not yet disclosed. For Shutterfly, today’s deal builds on recent acquisitions of Nexo ( acquired for $15 million in 2008 ), TinyPrints (acquired for $300 million) and Photoccino, an Israeli photo startup it picked up in May.\nIn March, faltering photo giant Kodak passed off its gallery printing services to Shutterfly for $23.8 million. With the spate of acquisitions of hot mobile apps, Shutterfly is presumably hoping to avoid Kodak’s fate. Unable to adapt and survive in the digital age, Eastman Kodak Company filed for bankruptcy in January.\nShutterfly, a Silicon Valley-based company, says it will blend Penguin Digital’s technology into its own iPad, iPhone, and Android apps. Penguin Digital is best known for Mobile Photo Gallery, “MoPho” for short, an app that makes it easier to order physical copies of images from your iPhone’s photo library, and print them on mugs, canvases, T-shirts, and iPhone cases.\n“The acquisition of Penguin Digital supports our mobile strategy aimed at giving consumers better ways to engage with their photos and personalize products on the go,” said Jeffrey Housenbold, president and CEO of Shutterfly in a statement. “We believe it’s important to give consumers the choice and convenience of transforming their memories into high quality products and gifts from their PC, tablet, and mobile phone.”\nPenguin Digital was founded in 2010 with $1 million in seed funding from  Globis Capital , among others. Founders Reuven Moskowitz and Josh Friedman and the rest of the Penguin Digital team will head up Shutterfly’s New York office.\nTop Image via Shutterstock\nAI.

That’s because CBS (s CBS) announced that in early April “dozens” of its shows will become available on Netflix streaming. This maintains CBS’s status as the only major network to keep its content off Hulu, and gives Netflix subscribers access to a wealth of shows previously unavailable online.\nThe bulk of what CBS is giving Netflix is back content from its library, but that does include some notable additions to the Netflix catalog. Some of the shows that will become available for streaming, including Cheers and Frasier, are completely unavailable on any other platform; others, such as Twin Peaks and Family Ties, have been limited to distribution on TV.com or Fancast.\nAdvertisement\nThe release also promises that “all generations” of Star Trek will be available, which is good news for any fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine, as those shows have never had full online distribution beyond iTunes. (s AAPL)\nAdvertisement\nHowever, while this deal adds new depth to Netflix’s selection, it doesn’t give it a huge advantage when it comes to Hulu’s primary specialty: current TV. For recent series, at this point CBS is only promising Netflix Medium (which was just officially canceled ) and Flashpoint, a Canadian import that CBS airs during the summer.\nAdvertisement\nSo it seems unlikely that new hits like the network’s Hawaii 5-0 reboot (only available via the CBS site, iTunes and TV.com) will join Netflix. However, the original Hawaii 5-0 will be available.\nAdvertisement\nWhat the deal indicates is that CBS, like other members of big media , sees Netflix distribution as a serious competitor to the still-lucrative syndication market. Some of the shows that Netflix will be streaming, such as Cheers, have been in syndication for decades; their value to the secondary TV market doesn’t compare to a more current show like NCIS: LA, which USA picked up last year for $2.5 million an episode .\nAdvertisement\nIn short, don’t expect to see The Good Wife on Netflix anytime soon, but as Netflix promises to shell out larger licensing fees , more and more classic television may find a home there.\nAdvertisement\nRelated content on GigaOM Pro: (subscription required)\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Some 47 mobile social network companies have emerged globally, to help cater to our need to message and communicate while on the go.\nBut what about the huge incumbents, like MySpace or Facebook? Will they thrive on the mobile web?\nWell, the 47 mobile-only networks will probably tell you that mobile is a whole different animal, and downplay the threat of a switch by their millions of users to those big guys. But in reality, even though some mobile-only social networks have gotten big — Mocospace , for example, has 1 billion page impressions worldwide, most of it in the US — their computer-based rivals are catching up now that new wireless devices, such as the iPhone, are making it easier for internet apps to transition to mobile.\nMy goal for this article was to find the top ten most significant social mobile companies.\nIt was difficult reporting. With so many different players competing in the mobile social network space, we’re seeing a lot of different approaches and fragmentation. For my own thinking, I sketched out a diagram during lunch with an entrepreneur (see above for a cleaned up version of it). It’s partly based on generalizations, but it’ll give you an idea of what’s happening here in the U.S.\nI’ve organized the mobile social companies into four groups. In addition to heavyweights MySpace and Facebook, I’ve picked eight companies — based on market share, differentiation through features, niche market and technology — that seem to be emerging as the most significant players.\n[Disclosure: I consult for one of the companies named here, Peperoni.]\nGroup 1: The internet heavyweights – MySpace and Facebook\nWhen I talked to MySpace and Facebook to see what kind of uptake they’d been seeing on their mobile sites (eg. m.myspace.com) I got quite a surprise. According to the user numbers they provided, both companies have already passed Mocospace.\nMySpace’s Brandon Lucas, Senior Director of Mobile Business Development told me MySpace Mobile USA had 1.4 billion impressions last month. That’s compared to 1 billion visits to Mocospace this March, according to Mocospace CEO Justin Siegel. A source at Facebook confirmed to me that Facebook Mobile has also passed Mocospace’s numbers in the USA, too, but didn’t give me specific numbers. Expect announcements on that in the coming weeks.\nMySpace Mobile launched in December 2006, followed by Facebook Mobile a month later. The growth of MySpace Mobile and Facebook Mobile is mainly due to operator deals that put them “ondeck.” MySpace and Facebook are looking to close as many deals with operators as possible. For Myspace Mobile, the goal is to be available on-deck with “every major operator, everywhere,” Lucas says. As of now, MySpace Mobile has signed 23 carriers in 13 countries, and we expect the number to rise. M-Metrics told MySpace Mobile around three weeks ago that they are the fastest growing mobile site in the US, says Lucas.\nThe barrier to traffic growth, according to Lucas, is awareness. Expect more banner ads for MySpace Mobile on its web site very soon to raise awareness. MySpace is willing to split revenue with operators, he says. Despite the split, “mobile advertising has grown in the last six months to be a real business for us”, he adds. He sees MySpace as playing the same role on mobile devices as it does on the web. He wants MySpace to be a “mobile advertising driver” for the industry — and wants to lure the brands advertising on its online version to add mobile advertising too. He said MySpace Mobile “wants to build a business for everybody” and that “we will share insights for everybody to profit.”\nI also asked Lucas to comment on a MySpace strategy statement I came across in Stuart Dredge’s recent article on social mobile networking in New Media Age: ”We expect that half of our total traffic will be coming from mobile devices within the next five years,” the article quoted a MySpace representative as saying. Brandon said that’s a January quote from MySpace CEO Chris De Wolfe and reaffirms that mobile is one of the most important strategic initiatives for MySpace.\nMeanwhile, Facebook has also come out with an “operator” platform designed to let wireless carriers integrate Facebook features like simple login and built-in Facebook multimedia messaging (MMS) — and that includes a revenue-sharing deal for both parties.\nFacebook has also focused on the smartphone market and come out with an easy-to-use application for the iPhone. It ahas an application for RIM’s Blackberry. The app’s stat counted 212,238 daily active users when we checked yesterday. Facebook has also included links to its iPhone application from within its web site, which has doubtlessly increased traffic. Still, we can only speculate on how large the traction really is. Most iPhone users, from what he hear, access the “web” site and not the “mobile” site of both social networks. Neither Facebook nor MySpace has revealed data how much traffic they get from the iPhone to their web sites.\nGroup 2: The big on-deck players — AirG, Jumbuck\nBoth AirG and Jumbuck offer mobile community products to operators. They are the biggest of those that rely mostly on ondeck traffic. They’re also the most mature. (Most of the other 47 mobile social network players fall into the on-deck category, too, but are smaller.) The term “mature” refers here to their company structures, the number of deals they have with operators, their effectiveness in developing new mobile products, and their current financial possibilities.\nTheir maturity puts the companies in a good position to move in a variety of directions. However, at the same I think they may be the most vulnerable to MySpace and Facebook. They’re very dependent on deals with the carriers, and I see harder negotiations with the carriers ahead as carriers ask them how they’re different to MySpace/Facebook. We may see them react by shifting their models to some degree.\nGroup 3: The mobile off-deck players — Mocospace, Buzzcity’s MyGamma, Peperoni’s Peperonity, GoFresh’s Itsmy\nDistribution is one of the key challenges in the emerging mobile industry. The biggest advantage this second group has, I think, is that they all have their own, early and successful approaches to how a shift from the traditional on-deck model can be done .\nAll four companies have gained significant traffic and — from what I’ve seen — gotten pretty good traction in the last 10 months or so. What makes Mocospace particularly impressive is that it went offdeck from day one, back in 2006, and has gotten as big as it is has so fast without carrier help and with relatively little venture backing ($3 million raised last year) . The service has nearly 3 million members today, according to CEO Justin Seigel.\nSingapore-based Buzzcity has both a mobile community and mobile ad network. Its MyGamma mobile community has reached 2.5 million users since 2003, according to CEO KF Lai. Lai claims that Buzzcity is the second biggest mobile ad network behind Admob . It only trails Admob in the US and served 1 billion ad pages last month, worldwide. These numbers, mind you, do not relate to traffic at MyGamma only: They include ads served to the 500 publishers on Buzzcity’s inventory platform (up from 50 last year).\nPeperonity , founded by parent company Peperoni in 2001, lets users design their own mobile pages [again, I’ve done consulting work for this company]. It started out as on-deck service but is now driven by both on-deck and off-deck traffic. With the off-deck segment, Peperonity is one of Admob’s biggest publishers , with 350 million ad pages displayed this February. Initial traffic growth at Peperonity was driven by on-deck deals with operators. Because Peperoni has standing operator partnerships with large, sticky user communities, new users are easier to pick up. The company doesn’t disclose exact numbers, but I’m comfortable saying it’s in a similar range to MocoSpace’s worldwide.\nLast but not least in this group is social mobile network Itsmy from German company GoFresh . The company had 500 million page impressions in March, half of MocoSpace. The company offers a similar mobile network service to the others in the group with over a million users and has also created its own ad network. Many mobile ad networks launched in the last couple of months, of course, and they all face challenges . Still, it seems a good move for both Buzzcity and GoFresh.\nKey to the success in this group of off-deck players is their ability to understand mobile features that have been working well in the bigger mobile markets, particularly in the US, and compile them into a coherent whole — features such as photo, video, chat and microblogging. In marketing, they do well in focusing on particular demographics, such as low-income users. Take Buzzcity, for example. Says CEO Lai: “We want to offer a compelling service to low-end phone users…Look at the worldwide market and this is what you will see.” Most of MyGamma’s traffic is located in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, in that order. In many of the countries it serves, mobile is not only the premier way of communication, but also of internet access. The company just entered the US market this April.\nThese offdeck players have mixed feelings about MySpace/Facebook arriving on the scene. Says Mocospace’s Siegel: “I knew since the day we started MocoSpace that every internet company would move to mobile over the next few years. However, I believe, and the reality is today, that companies focused entirely on mobile will deliver a better mobile experience and product than companies where only a small fraction of their resources are spent on mobile.”\nTo Buzzcity’s Lai, (off-deck) competition boils down to volume and understanding trends in mobile usage. In regards to MySpace/Facebook Mobile, he says calmly: “It’s still early days” and there are “different niches for different players.” Online and mobile community users constitute two different types. Online users use their web network and mobile users use their mobile one, and they haven’t mixed much, he said. Marcus Ladwig, COO Peperoni, on the other hand believes MySpace/Facebook will pose real competition, “however we’re not really afraid of this development,” he says. “I’m glad about competition from this field, as they’ll help emerge the mobile market and open it up for web-centric audiences. Customers will choose the network that fits their needs best anyway.”\nGroup 4: The new off-deck players — Bluepulse, Zannel\nI lump these two companies together because both manage to connect messaging services to sizable off-deck markets. Bluepulse is a free mobile messaging service that’s very easy to use on most mobile devices (VentureBeat coverage). The question for Bluepulse, really, is how important that feat really is. If you believe CEO Ben Keighran, then Bluepulse is ready to take on Yahoo and Google as the mobile starting page. Quite ambitious, if not clever marketing, to make that claim, one may argue.\nBluepulse launched at the end of 2006 and served 150 million messages last month. In terms of user base, it’s mostly US and mostly off-deck, Keighran says. He says that “traffic grew considerably” since their re-launch in October 2007 but did not disclose enough about numbers to give me clues about its traction, so it’s difficult to say how well the re-launch has served Bluepulse’s ambitions so far.\nIn terms of monetization, Bluepulse follows an off-deck, advertising model. I asked Keighran what effects the iPhone, Google’s Android platform and location-based services would have on Bluepulse, and he says he views all of those developments positively. “The iPhone changes the awareness in the USA, in particular, on what mobile can do.” For Bluepulse, the iPhone is one of the top ten devices in the USA. Bluepulse doesn’t plan to offer any particular services based on Android or location-based services until it sees the market maturing more.\nZannel is a messaging service that lets users post video, picture and texting updates to communication with others across various devices. It offers additional value to customers via content partnerships. Many reviews I’ve seen describe Zannel as “a multimedia Twitter.” Reviewers tend to assess Zannel in the context of various Twitter clones, and Zannel’s features compare well in that light. Yet Zannel is the only company in the group of Twitter clones I contacted for input on this story that was repeatedly identified as a competitor.\nZannel did not disclose detailed traffic figures to me, beyond saying “we currently serve millions of users per month.” Assuming that’s true, that easily makes them one of the big players in the field, and their claim to be “mobile’s first Instant Media Messaging service” may be valid, when you look at market acceptance and consider that rich media apps are its No. 1 traffic driver, according to the company. The majority of Zannel’s business is off-deck where Zannel sees “incredibly fast, viral uptake,” suggesting strong recent growth. Over two thirds of Zannel’s traffic comes from the mobile web, the remainder comes from online.\nZannel sees the iPhone as a transformative product for mobile industry — it increases awareness of mobile’s potential and is a great platform for distributing rich media apps (Zannel’s traffic driver). As a mobile media messaging hub, Zannel lets users visually communicate with other users across all major social networks vs. just one. Therefore, Zannel sees the major social networks as complementary services rather than direct competitors. As these social networks open up their social graphs/platforms/APIs, Zannel believes its own services will become interwoven with theirs and that they’ll provide more value to end-users together than apart. Although that approach may be no news in an internet world, Zannel’s one of the first “working” mobile models to pursue that direction.\nFinal thoughts\nMySpace and Facebook’s sudden growth in mobile will certainly have big implications. Mobile startups that are already big will need to continue trying hard to differentiate themselves in the face of increasing competition. People invested in small mobile networks will also need to think hard about the ability of those networks to scale up. Smaller players are also unlikely to gain traction as easily as they used to. On the other hand, there are still some verticals, like location-based services, waiting to be tapped.\nIn addition to the ten companies I’ve profiled, a number of other interesting players hit my radar while I was doing interviews to piece this story together. Some of the other companies people suggested I include were: Mig33 , icebreaker.mobi , Juicecaster , Zyb , Frengo , Intercasting and Treemo . Of course, smaller online social networks like hi5, Friendster and Bebo are also looking at mobile services. There may also be players that I didn’t manage to unearth, either because I didn’t drill hard enough for competitors in the segments I looked at, or because I didn’t rigorously scope out international offers. But VentureBeat will be keeping a close eye on this market, so plan to hear more from us on this again soon. In the meantime, send us your comments and suggestions of any other players you think we should be taking a look at.\nMatthäus Krzykowski is a freelancer, covering mobile for Venturebeat.\nEric Eldon contributed to this article.\nAI.

The software can participate as a distributed node of Greenplum’s Enterprise Data Cloud, enabling centralised management, data discovery and data sharing across databases. In addition, the database features hybrid row and column-oriented processing as well as fully parallel SQL and MapReduce processing.\nAccording to Greenplum, there is also unlimited production usage on a single commodity x86 server using up to two CPU sockets, or in a single virtual machine using up to eight virtual cores.\nAs part of its pitch, Greenplum cited a recent survey of more than 400 data warehousing professionals by Greenplum and B-Eye-Network that found companies are now conducting the majority of analytical projects outside the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). Over half of respondents said that the data their team needs lies outside the data warehouse, and more than 75 percent are using tools such as SAS, Excel and MySQL to work with their data. The majority also said that they prefer to work with “raw” rather than “clean” data.\n“In most cases the tools available to these [data analysts], at their desks, are sub-optimal,” Snee said. “We want to arm these individuals with Greenplum’s enterprise-class analytic database. Making it available for free accelerates the adoption of a distributed system model for data warehousing, such as Greenplum’s Enterprise Data Cloud.”\nRecommend this article:\n", "deleted" : false }

Just go to YouTube and look at how many views it has.\nExcept YouTube isn’t the only site around (as I remind myself anytime I look at the view counts on TechCrunch’s YouTube channel ). That’s why Visible Measures , a startup focused on video analytics and advertising, has launched a new site called True Reach , bringing viewing data together from across the web.\nThe data displayed on True Reach is pretty straightforward — it shows you a bunch of videos and their total viewership across what it says are hundreds of video sites, including YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, DailyMotion, and AOL (which owns TechCrunch). If you click on a video, you’ll not only be able to see it play, but also view the number of sites and clips (Visible Measures and True Reach is more interested in the success of an entire video campaign rather than an individual video) being counted.\nCEO Brian Shin compared this to “the total box office” of a video, whereas looking at YouTube is “just one big theater chain.” For example, his team pointed me to Land Rover’s video promoting the new Range Rover Sport, which has around 503,000 views on YouTube, compared to a True Reach of about 6.2 million . Less dramatic but still significant — Jean-Claude Van Damme’s epic split video for Volvo 77.3 million views on YouTube, and a True Reach of nearly 140 million\nShin also said that while True Reach is focused on marketing campaigns, it’s not limited to Visible Measures clients.\nBut if someone isn’t a client, I wondered about how accurate the technology could be at determining that two different videos on two different sites are part of the same campaign. He replied that the data collection is largely tech driven and “extremely technically scalable,” but there are also humans checking the results.\nThe information on True Reach is available for free. Presumably, Shin is hoping that it’ll lure some visitors into becoming Visible Measures customers. Last year, he suggested that the company had been “a little closed” and unknown to anyone who wasn’t a customer, and this seems like a smart step to reverse that.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

There were 158,211 tweets Sunday night about Dash, as viewers weren’t sure what to make of the bit (she was in on the joke).\nMeanwhile, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America won social buzz thanks to Rock’s shtick about selling his daughter’s Girl Scout cookies to the audience. There were 49,023 tweets about Girl Scout cookies during the telcast, compared with only 2,322 for Dolby (which has naming rights to the theater where the Oscars were held) over the same time period.\nAside from DiCaprio, none of the other winners in the four major acting categories were in the top five most-tweeted personalities, according to the Amobee analysis. Lady Gaga, who performed the Oscar-nominated song “Til It Happens to You” from the documentary “The Hunting Ground,” was mentioned in 271,908 tweets, while Sam Smith, who performed and won best original song for the “Writing’s on the Wall” James Bond theme, was mentioned in 134,649 tweets over the four-hour period.\nAmobee analyzed Twitter data globally, but the company said the Oscar tweets skewed heavily toward U.S. users.\n", "deleted" : false }

Photo via The New York Times\nSeattle lost one of its most prolific angel investors last month when former banking executive Robert Arnold died at the age of 84 after a brief illness. Arnold was one of the most active angel investors in the Pacific Northwest, using his skills as a banker as well as his love of people to discover some of the hottest startups emerging in the region.\nAlliance of Angels chairman Dan Rosen said at one time Arnold was actively invested in 189 startup companies.\nA former banking executive at Seattle First National Bank, Arnold took an unconventional approach to angel investing. He’d often back entrepreneurs based on a gut instinct, picking teams that he believed in.\nOn more than one occasion, Arnold would write down a dollar amount on the back of a business card after hearing a pitch at an Alliance of Angels meeting. He’d then present the card to the entrepreneur after the pitch.\n“It was on more than one occasion that that entrepreneur would come afterwards and say: ‘What’s this?’ But Bob helped start some of the very best companies in Seattle, and was very active with many of them,” said Rosen. “He will be sorely missed by all of us in the angel community.”\nOne of those entrepreneurs was Todd Humphrey, an executive at Kobo who previously raised money from Arnold and others for the Seattle analytics startup CleverSet. Arnold was the largest investor in the company, which sold to e-commerce software company ATG for $10 million in 2008.\nHumphrey said that Arnold invested first and foremost in the people behind the idea.\n“Bob believed in investing in people first, and that allowed him to stand out from other investors,” said Humphrey. “He believed in giving entrepreneurs a chance to prove themselves and that served him, and this community, so well.”\nHumphrey also encountered Arnold’s unconventional approach when he was raising a second round for CleverSet.\n“I left his office with a check in hand, but received a call from him not 10 minutes later saying: ‘Todd, I believe in you, and what you are building. If you will allow me to, I would like to double the investment I just made to you. Please come back to my office for a revised check.’ That is how Bob worked, from his gut, from his heart. He was a pillar of a man, and I will miss him, as will Seattle.”\nNot everything that Arnold touched turned to gold, and one of his most recent investments also turned out to be one of his worst. He bankrolled a company called MOD Systems, which was developing a digital media kiosk technology for distribution of movies and TV shows. The company imploded after co-founder Mark Phillips was  sentenced to four years in prison in July 2011 on fraud and money laundering charges . The matter remains tied up in litigation , including a recent suit by Phillips against Arnold’s estate and others.\nDenny Hill Capital’s Jan Hendrickson said that Arnold largely moved on from the MOD Systems mess. And Hendrickson noted how Arnold’s investment style will be missed in Seattle.\n“He was this region’s pioneer angel, writing checks to entrepreneurs long before it was considered fashionable or a way of giving back to the ecosystem.  But he understood that the economic health of our region stemmed in part to growing new companies and therefore new jobs,” she said. “He embodied the best of what an entrepreneur could hope for in an investor:  patience, a guiding hand when needed but happy to sit on the sidelines/get out of the way after providing his considered thoughts.  He willingly took on significant risk, far greater than most angels today.”\nAccording to a paid obituary in The New York Times , Arnold graduated from the Lakeside School in Seattle, Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey and received his BA from Yale University in 1951. He later served in the Korean war as a naval aviator, flying missions from the decks of the Yorktown and the Essex aircraft carriers. The family has asked that donations be made to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; The Seattle Art Museum or The Swedish Medical Center — all philanthropic causes that Arnold was directly involved with.\nJohn Cook is GeekWire's co-founder and editor, a veteran reporter and the longest-serving journalist on the Pacific Northwest tech startup beat.

Who knew?\nIt turns out US-based Mainstream Technologies, which runs MOLI from its international headquarters in Dublin’s ‘Digital Hub’ area, raised almost €20.3m ($29.6m) from backers including the founder of the giant US Home Depot chain Bernard Marcus, and the chain’s co-founder, Kenneth Langone. They were joined by US hedge fund Vantis Capital Management, founded by Langone. Indeed GigaOm reports that founder Dr. Christos M. Cotsakos, former Chairman and CEO of E*TRADE and AC Nielsen, has already previously seeded the company with $20 million of his personal funds, plus $6 million from private investors. He has been busy.\nSo what is this innovative new business model? Annoyed with how Facebook only gives you one identity to manage friends, family and work? Well MOLI is designed to address the core issue of privacy. Users can create and manage diverse personal profiles via one user identity and a single, customised home page. In other words, mashup LinkedIn (work), Facebook (personal) and Musical tastes (MySpace) and then put some privacy controls in. That’s the theory at least.\nThere is no limit to the number of profiles, which are free with your first URL but further URLs cost $1.99. Cotsakos himself has 13 profiles, some personal, some work-related and some hidden. Users can decide which of their profiles are shared and to whom.\nBut this is not just a Facebook / LinkedIn mashup. MOLI is a social network aimed at “enterprising individuals above the age of 18 and small business owners”. These are people you probably know – people who have talent or a skill, often creatives or artists. So, for a mere $3.99 a month, you can have a retail site linked to a profile, which is in turn linked to a network you can, if you want, sell into. Think Facebook meets eBay or some other web store. So now you can sell your home-made wood carvings to your friends, while also pimping your hi-tech consultancy to your work network. Billing is by Google Checkout, or PayPal. MOLI also comes with an analytics engine, CoVibe Live, which MOLI has filed a patent for.\nAnd there is more to MOLI – which stands for “money and living” – than meets the eye. Mainstream has three main operating subsidiaries in addition to MOLI: CoVibe TECH, Tertiary Productions and MOLI Kids. CoVibe TECH is the underlying MOLI platform which they plan to license to other businesses. Tertiary Productions provides original, high-definition video content. And MOLI Kids is an online destination under development for children ages five and older.\nHowever, there could be an ice-burg heading MOLI’s way, and it is the heady but potentially dangerous blend of private, casual content with professional marketing and selling. Yes, you can pay $2.49 a month to make your experience ad-free, but what happens when your ‘friend’ flips into work mode and starts trying to sell stuff to you?\nFurthermore, one Ireland-based blogger, initially thrilled at the news that an Irish startup had secured such backing for a what seems to be a pretty sophisticated and well designed social network, has instead highlighted a concern about the level of controls in place inside this new network. Internet marketer Sabrina Dent, blogs :\n“For all the positioning and talk of “protecting your privacy” MOLI fails at the most basic hurdle. Because it doesn’t cloak new joins; in fact, it has to be displaying them somewhere, because within 15 minutes of joining, the spam started.”\nShe goes on to detail how the granular controls on profiles she expected did not appear to be in place (and has also had some over-enthusiastic MOLI employees trolling her blog, alas).\nBut for now, let us hope that MOLI can address these concerns in the weeks to come. In the meantime, it’s nice to see such a big project appear in Dublin.\n0\nTechCrunch Daily Our top headlines Delivered daily\nTC Week-in-Review Top stories of the week Delivered weekly\nCrunchBase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Delivered daily\nTC Europe The top European tech stories Delivered weekly\nTC Gadgets Top stories about gadgets Delivered weekly\nTC Mobile & Apps Top stories about apps Delivered weekly\nTC Startups Top stories about startups Delivered weekly\nTC Social Media Top stories about social Delivered weekly\nTC Asia The top Asian tech stories Delivered weekly\nCrunch Network The best from our contributors Delivered weekly\n| Natasha Lomas\nhttp://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/29/moli-wins-30m-to-keep-your-public-and-private-life-separate/ MOLI wins $30m to keep your public and private life separate\n[…] However, MOLI may need to tweak its privacy settings.

All music fans can expect from the company this holiday season is spin.\ncommentary Daniel Ek says he can't commit to a launch date for Spotify USA.\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek Ian Phillips-McLaren\nToo late. Ek, Spotify's founder and CEO, did commit. Maybe he forgot that he and his underlings have repeatedly said the launch of a U.S. version of Spotify, a popular European music service that offers free streaming songs in addition to a subscription offering, would open in the United States before the end of the year.\nWhat Ek knows and isn't saying is that Spotify will miss that deadline, just as it has missed other launch dates.\nAs of last week, Spotify had yet to sign a single licensing deal with a major label, after spending more than a year negotiating, multiple music sources told CNET. The way things are shaping up, all U.S. music fans can expect from Ek this Christmas is spin .\nOn the surface, a missed launch deadline doesn't sound like much. We've seen only a few hundred thousand of those. But dig into the company's predicament a little, and something more troubling starts to appear.\nSpotify is a hugely popular business , with lots of potential that it may never fulfill. The company simply hasn't demonstrated a means to pay for the music it gives away to users--or said another way, the company's business model appears to be broken. If it's not broken, it is certainly unconvincing.\nThe major music companies are not going to allow Spotify to jump to the United States without knowing how they are going to get compensated, and Spotify appears unable to tell them--at least to the labels' satisfaction. For that reason, the labels want Spotify to pay a premium because of the risks the company's service poses to other revenue streams, insiders say. The most important of those financial tributaries flows from Apple's iTunes .\nThere's no doubt that Spotify's service is clever and easy to use--and that it would attract a U.S. audience. There is, however, plenty of doubt about whether enough people will pay to use it. There is also a fear in the music industry that by offering users free music streams, Spotify could cut into sales at iTunes and elsewhere.\nSpotify says not to worry because the company also sells subscriptions, and at a conference held by All Things Digital today, Ek said the company now has 750,000 people paying the equivalent of $13 a month to access it.\nThe problem there is that Spotify has 10 million total users. That means the rate at which the company is converting users of the free service to the paid service is 7.5 percent. Some music executives have said they want to see twice that amount.\nThe labels also don't need Spotify in the U.S. Google is working on a music service, and there's no doubt which company the labels believe stands a better chance of mounting a serious challenge to Apple's dominance. The top recording companies have long hoped to see the rise of another strong digital-music outlet so the industry's dependence on Apple might be reduced.\nThen throw in Spotify's report that it lost $26 million in 2009 and that it spoke to Google about a possible sale, according to a report in TechCrunch. Was Ek just testing the waters, or does he lack confidence in the company's ability to generate money? That kind of news is likely to give some in the music industry pause.\nSpotify is starting to remind me of SpiralFrog and Qtrax. Those companies were led by managers who also made lots of big promises but failed to deliver.\nBoth services said they would help answer the music industry's piracy problem. Qtrax, which billed itself as a legal peer-to-peer service , once threw a huge party in France to celebrate a U.S. launch, but it didn't own the rights to any music. Later, the company made at least two other promises to enter the U.S., and we've yet to see it.\nSome pundits suggested that SpiralFrog was an iTunes killer. The company managed only to license music from two of the four major labels and was also undermined by a plethora of management problems. It closed down last year.\nNeither of those companies managed to build the kind of following that Spotify has in Europe. But we've seen popular services with loads of customers fail before. Imeem had 17 million users. Lala was popular, as was Project Playlist. Not one of them ever turned a profit.\nIt's a sad fact of life, but having lots of users doesn't always add up to profits.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

While things mostly seem to work OK, the app was originally written in Spanish, and the translation to English hasn’t been done very well (and in some places, it hasn’t been translated at all), which doesn’t exactly make it easy to use.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWhile I was able navigate around the app and could set up projects and tasks, I have a smattering of Spanish and experience with similar online project management tools. I think Doolphy would be too bewildering for non-technical, non-Spanish speaking users, and I can’t imagine being able to get a team using it — which, like most PM tools, is what Doolphy is really designed for. Additionally, even though the app is supposedly now fully launched, there’s not much in the way of help documentation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Spanish version of Doolphy may be a useful app (the free version allows unlimited users, one project and limited storage is available if you’d like to try it), but as I don’t speak Spanish well enough, I haven’t tried it. And until Doolphy improves its internationalization, I really can’t recommend the English version against the many high-quality, established PM tools already on the market like 5pm , Wrike and Basecamp . Note to developers: Beta testing shouldn’t only be used to iron out bugs in your software, it’s also the time to make sure that any internationalization of your tools has been carried out perfectly, and that your documentation is adequate.\nAdvertisement\nIf you speak Spanish and have tried Doolphy, let us know what you think of it in the comments.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Today, it launched an improved version of the site.\nFor those who are not familiar with Spotplex, it offers up a snippet of code that blog owners can install on their site. That snippet does two things. First, it provides information about its traffic to the blog owner, much like Google Analytics . Second, and most interesting, it uses traffic data from the sites that have this code snippet installed to determine the most popular stories in a variety of categories. One major complaint with the site initially was that larger sites would have a huge advantage in getting popular stories to the home page since they get a lot of traffic. Spotplex has corrected that and it now judges an article's popularity relative to the traffic that the site normally gets.\nAmong the other improvements it is offering today is a new geographical tracking feature , so you can see what stories are popular in different parts of the world and blog analytics tools that are customized for the various blogging platforms.\nThe major problem I see with Spotplex is that in order for the stories on its front page to be accurate, a large percentage of bloggers have to have its code installed. This is a vastly different approach from what Digg or Techmeme do. They give all sites an equal chance of making the front page, regardless of whether or not they know that they are participating. This results in a much more accurate representation of the most popular stories on the Internet. Spotplex, however, maintains this approach is flawed because these sites rely on the contribution of users. Spotplex is hoping that its customized analytics tools will coax blog owners into installing the code, but I'm not so sure that this is a big enough draw.\nI had the chance to talk with Spotplex's CEO, Doyon Kim, about this release and how they might go about attracting more blog owners to use the service. He clued me in that they are working on some key partnerships with the people behind popular blogging tools such as Blogger and Six Apart . This could help to significantly increase Spotplex's user base, but we will have to wait and see how that pans out.\nRight now, Spotplex has served up 7,000 code snips to bloggers and it estimates that it has 3,000 to 4,000 bloggers with the code currently installed. Spotplex seems to have a good idea going in theory, but in order for this to be pulled off correctly, it will have to have mass participation by the blogosphere, which will prove to be very tough.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

But a handful of upstarts try their hand at it at the Under the Radar Conference.\nby Stefanie Olsen\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--YouTube--that's the first name in Internet video. Apple's iTunes might turn up second.\nFor start-ups in Internet video, it can be a tough sell to prove a new market. But a handful of upstarts tried their hand at an elevator pitch here Tuesday at the Under the Radar Conference , a one-day confab for Web start-ups. Four video-related companies presented their business models in six minutes to judges including Lewis Henderson, head of digital at the William Morris Agency, and Joshua Newman from Twentieth Century Fox.\nHere are the aspiring newcomers:\nJacked\nAn interactive Web companion for TV broadcasts. If you want to spice up the broadcast of the Lakers game, for example, visit Jacked.com and click on the game ticket. Without downloads or connection to the TV, the site will deliver news, products, photos, sports stats, or related information to the game via an array of widgets. Launched last September, Santa Monica, Calif.-based Jacked, which has raised $6.5 million, uses a search engine to crawl the Web for content related to the live broadcast, such as Amazon.com, Associated Press, and Flickr. It has deals with the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball, among others. It supports the site with advertisements and distribution partnerships with sports leagues or, potentially, broadcast networks.\nOne of the first questions judges asked of the company: Why should people care? \"Consumers want control over their experience. They want the convenience of everything on one page,\" said company executive Bryan Biniak.\nMovieSet\nAn online social network for movie production. Independent film producers can use MovieSet's technology to publish their production schedule online and upload behind-the-scenes videos during the making of a movie. The goal is to attract fans before the film's release. The Vancouver, B.C.-based company, which recently raised $2 million, already has drawn as many as 150 feature films, including the Charlize Theron film Battle in Seattle, to the technology. MovieSet is still in beta.\nOne question from the judges: Why aren't you involved with the major studios? Mark Rutledge, chief operation officer of MovieSet and a former entertainment lawyer, said that the company has had several meetings with Creative Artists Agency and the studios are showing some interest. But they're not quite ready to sign up yet.\n\"We're taking advantage of the long tail for independent films,\" Rutledge said.\nVerismo\nAppleTV for the rest of the world. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company makes a Wi-Fi-enabled device called the Pod that plugs into the television and streams content from the Internet (no PC required, according to company CEO Prakash Bhalerao). With the Pod, people can download movies from BitTorrent, CinemaNow, or Blockbuster; watch videos from YouTube; or simply surf the Web with a Qwerty remote that controls the box. The device costs $99.\nOne of the judges asked, what's the difference between the Pod and Apple TV ? \"Apple TV goes only to the Apple site. Other than Youtube, you cannot go anywhere. I can take you to 10,000 sites,\" Bhalerao said.\nVusion\nEncoding technology for high-definition video over the Internet. The Milpitas, Calif.-based company, which launched this month, develops a software infrastructure that will help movie studios or sports companies deliver commercial-grade video online. Grover Righter, vice president of marketing, said that the technology can serve high-definition video superior to MPED 4 or Flash players (which is encoded and encrypted) to at least 85 percent of the Internet audience. Those people need a browser plug-in, however.\nHow does it make money? It charges studios or sports agencies by the stream on the order of 15 cents per hour. (Righter said the company is in talks with all the major content companies.) It has raised just under $10 million.\nThe winner: the judges choose Vusion and the audience, Verisimo. They won a copy of Microsoft Zune or Microsoft Ultimate Software suite.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

And, the problem can be traced in part to the rise of social networking and multimedia sites, the research contends.\nThe report also contends that the use of Web 2.0 applications has spread rapidly, with more than 97 percent of all companies surveyed allowing their employees some ability to access such tools, compared to only 85 percent one year ago.\nIn addition, some 60 percent of all the organizations surveyed said that they currently have eight or more of the technologies being somehow used on their networks. On average, the involved companies reported that they had 9.3 Web 2.0 applications in use by employees on the enterprise networks.\nFaceTime, which markets gateway filtering technologies that promise to allow organizations to control the use of Web 2.0 tools on their assets, among other security features, said that it launched the annual research effort four years ago to determine the impact that \"collaborative Internet applications have on companies and organizations.\"\nThe most significant problem in balancing adoption of Web 2.0 tools with IT security concerns is that users remain convinced that they should have the right to use the systems however they see fit, without considering many of the risks that can be introduced, the company maintains.\n\"For all four years, end users have claimed they have the right to download and use whatever applications they choose to help them do their jobs. This year's study also reveals their social media habits have extended into the workplace and may be contributing to security and data leakage incidents,\" Frank Cabri, vice president of marketing and product management at FaceTime , said in a report summary.\n\"IT managers are often at odds with employees' belief that they have the right to use whatever applications they feel they need to do their jobs, including these Internet applications that are evasive and easily circumvent existing security infrastructure. They create potential compliance, information leakage concerns as well as introducing myriad vectors for incoming malware,\" he said.\nAt the same time that organizations are allowing for more use of Web 2.0 tools, few are moving to secure the systems in any way (less than 25 percent), in particular compared to e-mail and Web browsing systems (secured at 79 percent and 65 percent, respectively).\nAnd curiously, though they may required to do so under federal regulations, a relatively large number of organizations said that they are monitoring (38 percent) and storing (31 percent) IM-based communications.\nIn terms of the other Web 2.0 and security observations offered in the report:\n-79 percent of responding employees use social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube) at work for business reasons and 51 percent access social media sites at least once per day.\n-IT managers reported an average of 34 security and data leakage incidents per month.\n-73 percent of IT managers report at least one security incident as a result of Internet application usage; viruses, Trojans and worms (59 percent) are most common, followed by spyware (57).\n-37 percent of companies report an instance of non compliance with corporate or regulatory policy, while 27 percent report incidents of accidental or unintentional data leakage.\n-Despite the new Federal Rules for Civil Procedure, only 31 percent of enterprises store IM communications. One in four has copies of audio conferences (25 percent), while slightly fewer (20 percent) archive corporate Web conferences.\nMatt Hines has been following the IT industry for over a decade as a reporter and blogger, and has been specifically focused on the security space since 2003, including a previous stint writing for eWeek and contributing to the Security Watch blog.

The list of scams demonstrated by the WhiteHat dudes -- which placed emphasis on finding grey areas through which to commit shady online operations not specifically addressed by law -- seem woefully less dangerous by comparison ... and in most cases far more profitable.\nGrossman characterized the techniques outlined, which included everything from gaming e-coupons to manipulating the stock market, as being achieved through mere bending of the \"parameters of legality to make cash.\" And the examples he used clearly illustrated that the larger world is still having a hard time aligning its rules with the electronic universe.\nFor instance, for relatively short change, scammers are selling services that offer to help aspiring hackers or spies beat CAPTCHAs, the ubiquitous automated tests used to distinguish between machines and humans online.\nAs with the other techniques outlined by the experts, whether doing so is actually illegal remains pretty unclear. However, the practice has grown so robust that it has already spawned a price war among involved providers, and one that spans almost the entire globe.\nAt the high end, Grossman and Ford highlighted the case of some savvy Estonian stock traders who figured out a way to guess the URLs of corporate financial reports awaiting release on Business Wire, allowing them to trade stocks on the data before it was released publicly.\nWhen the traders eventually got their day in court, a judge decided that they hadn't actually engaged in insider manipulation as described by the applicable laws.\nThat's the big point that the researchers were trying to make, that we need new laws and policies to help prevent some of these gray area attacks from getting over -- because in some cases, while clearly unfair or illegitimate, these attacks are not officially illegal, at least not in the manner that they should be.\nOther similarly illicit yet unaccounted-for scams the experts exposed included:\n-Scamming e-coupon systems by guessing the numbers of unused offers and adding them together to buy thousands of dollars of online goods.\n-Signing up for thousands of online bank accounts, and using money transfer verification services to get a few pennies deposited in each, then aggregating those funds and closing the accounts. Free money! (It's worth noting that the guy doing this made over $50,000 before getting nailed on a technicality of the Patriot Act, since the banks hadn't established a policy for this type of abuse).\n-Hacking the systems of ASPs (application service providers) that serve online banking applications to brick and mortar banks. This one has allowed hackers to go after large groups of customers at once rather than one at a time, to the tune of over $70,000 in one case that involved reverse money transfers.\n-Gaming QVC returns. Someone figured out how to place orders on the QVC site and then cancel them, but still receive the ordered goods, which he or she was not required by law to return. The involved party only got busted when the people he or she was reselling the goods to on eBay noticed that their stuff was arriving in unmolested QVC packaging. This one eventually led to wire fraud charges.\n-Affiliate networks. We've all known about these for ages, and the systems by which cyber-scammers are making money for Web referrals they don't deserve, and doing so using cookies and other technological treats. Just release a small cookie that gets tacked onto people's browsers and then sit back and let them make money for you!\nSo, if you feel so obliged, start trying to find a new way to slither between existing online laws and you too might get rich ... you may end up getting busted, but it doesn't seem like you're going to die trying.\nG Unit!!!\nMatt Hines has been following the IT industry for over a decade as a reporter and blogger, and has been specifically focused on the security space since 2003, including a previous stint writing for eWEEK and contributing to the Security Watch blog.

The acquisition brings together leaders in their respective spaces to establish the next generation of Vulnerability and Risk Management (VRM) Solutions.\nBreaking down the walls between security teams is imperative to defend against the next wave of more sophisticated and advanced adversaries. The security industry has compartmentalized access and vulnerability management, leading fraudsters to exploit this weakness in almost every breach by moving quickly between these silos, and hiding in the cracks. The Courion and Core Security combination is exciting because it brings together two domain leaders and promises to provide the first continuous, comprehensive, current and historic view of the entire attack surface. With that, Courion can more effectively deter, detect and remediate breach activity.\n“Modern companies are too dependent on the digital ecosystem to partition themselves off with firewalls,” said Rick Holland, vice president, principal analyst, security & risk management at Forrester. “For this reason, it’s trendy to say ‘the security perimeter is dead’, but that’s not true, there are perimeters between security organizations and technologies all over the enterprise and this is precisely what needs to change.”\n“As evidenced by the stream of high profile breaches, compliance and regulatory risk is increasing across industries, there are just too many ways to be compromised so we need a risk based approach that considers how critical assets are exposed,” said Alex Naveira, IT director for Miami Children’s Health. “The combination of Courion and Core Security brings the logical access and infrastructure views together to give us the visibility of the full attack path and the governance process to audit and remediate risk.”\n“We fundamentally believe that we need to help customers to understand and manage all of their access and vulnerabilities or the adversaries will continue to have the upper hand,” said David Earhart, CEO of Courion. “With the acquisition of Core Security, along with our recent acquisition of SecureReset, we are demonstrating our commitment to help our customers manage down their threat surface from infrastructure to identity. Core Security and Courion both leverage intelligence to help customers to see and to solve vulnerability and access risk; both have outstanding products and brands. This combination will enable our customers to deter, detect, analyze and remediate problems with unrivalled speed, efficiency and efficacy.”\nTo learn more, contact 1.866.Courion or  info@courion.com  or visit  www.courion.com  or follow linkedin.com/Courion-Corporation .\nABOUT COURION\nWith deep experience and more than 600 customers managing more than 10 million identities, Courion is the market leader in Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), from provisioning to governance to Identity and Access Intelligence (IAI).

The bugs were discovered by Core researcher Martin Gallo.\nThe first vulnerability discloses a session cookie via the Sendio web interface URL. According to Core Security’s advisory, the interface authenticates users with a cookie named jsessionid. The issue arises because Sendio ESP’s interface includes the cookie value in the URL when obtaining email content.\n“This causes the application to disclose the session identifier value, allowing attackers to perform session hijacking,” the advisory said. “An attacker might perform this kind of attack by sending an email message containing links or embedded image HTML tags pointing to a controlled website, and then accessing victim’s session cookies through the ‘Referrer’ HTTP header. Accessing this authentication cookie might allow an attacker to hijack a victim’s session and obtain access to email messages or perform actions on behalf of the victim.”\nThe second bug is triggered via an improper handling of user sessions by the same Web interface, Core Security said.\n“Under certain conditions, this could lead to the server disclosing sensitive information that was intended for a different user,” the advisory said. “This information includes, for instance, other users’ session identifiers, email message identifiers or email message subjects. In order to trigger this vulnerability, requests should be authenticated.”\nThe advisory also includes Gallo’s proof of concept code.\nSuch broken authentication and session management flaws are listed on the OWASP top 10 list of web application security vulnerabilities. These types of bugs are often used to hijack sessions and impersonate victims, stealing account information and communication exchanges between parties.\n", "deleted" : false }

But eight years after Microsoft introduced its innovative severity rating system for software\nvulnerability, the company says its original definitions of what makes a software hole important still\napply. Security experts aren’t so sure.\nMicrosoft today released its final monthly patch release of 2010. The Redmond software giant went out in\nstyle with a large release of 17 bulletins containing fixes for some 40 vulnerabilities in Microsoft\nWindows, Office, Internet Explorer, SharePoint and Exchange. (https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/ms-\npatch-tuesday-heads-17-bulletins-40-vulnerabilities-120910) As is the case on every Patch Tuesday, the\nrelease will set off a scramble within enterprises large and small to sort out which patches are the most\nimportant to apply, and then to install them on affected systems. As they’ve done for almost a decade, IT\npros will rely on Microsoft’s Severity Rating System for software vulnerabilities to help answer those\nquestions. But are the labels that Microsoft puts on its security bulletins – ratings that declare patches\n“critical,” “important,” “moderate” or “low” – accurate? And does Microsoft’s definition of what makes a\nsecurity hole “severe” still reflect the computer security threats facing organizations? With the Severity\nRating system entering its tenth year, is it time for Redmond to take a fresh look at the way it ranks\nsecurity holes in its products?\nTo help answer that question, Threatpost spoke with experts at Microsoft’s Security Response Center and\ninterviewed some of the top vulnerability researchers and security experts in the industry to get their\nthoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of Microsoft’s decade old rating system, and whether changes are\nneeded to the way Microsoft rates security holes in its products.\nWho we talked to\nCesar Cerrudo: Cesar is the co-founder and CEO of Argeniss Information Security & Software in Parana,\nArgentina.

Chris started his IT security career as a\nsoftware engineer at Lotus Development Corp. and, later, as a founding member of the early hacker think\ntank the L0pht Heavy Industries in Boston. Chris later went to work for security consultancy @Stake, which\nwas acquired by Symantec. Chris was an early and important contributor to industry guidelines for so-\ncalled “responsible disclosure” of security vulnerabilities and co-author of the IETF RFC “Responsible\nVulnerability Disclosure Process” in 2002, which became a basis for the Organization of Internet Safety\n(OID) of which Chris is a founding member.  Chris is a frequent contributor to Threatpost, having written\nabout topics including “The Pitfalls of Website Vulnerability Research and Disclosure”(\nhttps://threatpost.com/pitfalls-website-vulnerability-research-and-disclosure-061510/) and\nCyberwarfare (https://threatpost.com/cyberwarfare-reality-check-070909/)\nDitch “Outdated Assumptions”\nThe experts we consulted about the current state of Microsoft’s Severity Rating System mostly had good\nthings to say. But all agreed that the system is due for renovation and that there was room for\nimprovement to the definitions that describe the severity of vulnerabilities.\nFirst and foremost, the experts we consulted agreed, Microsoft’s Severity Ratings are based on what most\nagreed were “outdated” assumptions about threats and attacks.\n“The threat space has changed greatly in the last eight years,” wrote Chris Wysopal, CTO at Veracode.\nFirst, attacks shifted away from worms and viruses – noisy and intrusive threats that were easy to\nisolate. This, Wysopal notes, reflected shift in the motivation of malware authors from “proving a point”\nto “monetizing vulnerable systems.” “If you are monetizing vulnerable systems you don’t want to do\nanything to call attention to yourself, especially with the network traffic a worm generates.”\n The second big change has been in the kinds of attacks Microsoft‘s customers are being targeted with.\nWithin the past couple years, those have shifted from a focus on core Windows components and vulnerable\nnetworks to what Wysopal described as a “target rich environment” in client software such as Adobe’s\nAcrobat Reader and Web browsers like Internet Explorer and Firefox top threats.  \nAlas, these important changes aren’t reflected in Microsoft’s Severity Rating System which, reflecting the\ntime at which it was created, still considers “Critical” holes as those that, when exploited, “could allow\nthe propagation of an Internet worm without user action.” “Important” vulnerabilities – the next level\ndown – could be any vulnerability “whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality,\nintegrity, or availability of user’s data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources.”\nThe problem isn’t so much that worms don’t matter, anymore. It’s that they’re no longer as big of a\nconcern as they were in 2002 and, by no means, are they the only concern.\nCharlie Miller, Principal Analyst at consulting firm Independent Security Evaluators, observed that few\ncompanies or consumers directly connect their computers to the Internet these days, which has reduced the\nimpact of worms. Even lowly home routers are remarkably effective at stopping worms, even though they\nweren’t designed for that purpose, Miller said.\nAdd it all up and it means that worms – while still a threat – don’t eclipse other dangers in the way they\nmight have eight or ten years ago.\n“Worms and widespread malware are indeed a health problem for the Internet ecosystem,” wrote Wysopal of\nVeracode. “They are like epidemics that should be treated (as such) even if they are rare.  But since they\nare rare they shouldn’t take up the whole top ranking of the severity rating system anymore.”\nCesar Cerrudo, CEO of Argeniss Information Security and Software, agreed that Microsoft’s definition of a\n“Critical” vulnerability no longer jives with the threats and attacks that organizations are contending\nwith. “For most ‘critical’ vulnerabilities right now, the exploitation consists of a user visiting a Web\npage or opening a (Microsoft) Office document, etc….There aren’t Internet worms being propagated,” Cerrudo\nwrote.\nBroadening the concept of severity to pull in more factors than just the ability to create worms is key to\nmodernizing the Severity Rating System, our experts agreed.  \nMake  Exploitability Count\nHow might the idea of Severity be broadened? One idea all our experts agreed on was the need to make the\nease with which vulnerability can be exploited an element of the severity rating. While “wormability”\nmatters, the ease with which vulnerability might produce a self-replicating threat is just one factor,\nbehind the ease with which any hole might be used – “exploited” – to take control of a remote system.\nCerrudo,  who has discovered prominent holes in Microsoft products including Windows and SQL Server, said\nthe increasing use of exploits for previously unknown (or “zero day”) vulnerabilities makes exploitability\nmore relevant now than it was ten years ago, but that Microsoft’s existing Severity Rating System fails to\nsufficiently account for it.\n“Critical for me should be any vulnerability that can be exploited remotely without needing user name and\npassword and with minimal user interaction,” he wrote. ”Important should be used for vulnerabilities that\nrequire local access or remote access with a user name and password, or that require complex user\ninteraction or specific configurations to work.”\nMiller agrees.\n“I think it’s important to …make a distinction between those vulnerabilities that are known to have an\nexploit ‘in the wild’ and those that are just known vulnerabilities,” he wrote\nThat might sound like common sense. But, as it stands, Microsoft tracks vulnerability severity and\nexploitability separately, according to Jerry Bryan, Group Manager for Response Communications at\nMicrosoft.\nSeverity is a measure of what Microsoft calls the “maximum impact” of vulnerability. That’s defined as\n“the highest impact vulnerability may have.” Bryan described “maximum impact” as a way of making sure that\nMicrosoft errs on the conservative side with its Severity Ratings. For example, Bryan explained in an\nemail, if a vulnerability could be used for remote code execution, but might also cause a denial of\nservice, Microsoft would consider the more severe case (remote code execution) when assigning a severity\nrating (in this case, a critical rating).\nInformation on how easy it is for attacker to use (or exploit) security vulnerabilities, however, is\ntracked in what Microsoft calls the ”Exploitability Index” a separate rating system introduced in 2008 in\nresponse to customer requests for more context around vulnerabilities. The Exploitability Index measures\nthe ease with which a vulnerability could be exploited, on a scale from 1 (“consistent exploit code\nlikely”) to 3 (“functioning exploit code unlikely”).\n“Together, these two pieces of information help organizations prioritize the deployment of Microsoft\nupdates for their environment by indicating the risk of an issue being exploited and the impact if the\nexploit is successful,” Bryan said in a statement.\nOf course, how “easy” something is to exploit is a subjective measure that’s based, in part, on the\nresearcher’s level of skill and expertise, Miller and others acknowledge. Other vulnerability scoring\nsystems, notably the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) that is maintained by the Forum of\nIncident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) blend exploitability data with other factors, including\nenvironmental considerations and “impact” – the way the vulnerability might expose sensitive data or be\nused to compromise or disable key systems. While not exact, the elements of CVSS ratings are simple enough\nto allow the creation of automated tools (http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2) for\ngenerating consistent severity scores as well as impact and exploitability sub scores.\nThat’s not a bad model for Microsoft, says Miller.\nSub ratings that indicated whether a vulnerability didn’t require user interaction to trigger and for\nwhich a public exploit was circulating, or – barring a public exploit – whether “mad skillz” would be\nrequired to create one or  ”my grandma could write the exploit,” would help shade an individual\nvulnerability in a way that would be useful for IT pros, Miller said.\nGet with the (CVSS) Program\nOne problem with Microsoft’s Severity Rating system is that the system, itself, is proprietary and doesn’t\nplay nice with other vendor-neutral industry standards.  Bulletins might link out to independent\nvulnerability tracking services like MITRE’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures List, but don’t\nnecessarily track to them.\nAt the same time, IT professionals have a wealth of information from the company on any vulnerability, but\nhave to cobble it together from different sources, including advance bulletin notifications, security\nadvisories, the MSRC blog, Microsoft’s exploitability index, and so on.\nThat complexity is enough that popular understanding of the Severity Ratings has drifted from their actual\ndefinitions. After almost a decade, he argues, the Ratings have become little more than “rules of thumb”\ninternalized by harried IT administrators rather than pinpoint accurate declarations about the potential\nharm that could result from a specific hole going unpatched, Cerrudo said.\n“I think what Microsoft has accomplished over the years (is) people associating a ‘Critical’ severity\nrating with ‘very dangerous,’ ‘patch should be applied ASAP,’ (and) ‘I’m going to be hacked if I don’t\npatch,’” Cerrudo wrote.  However, lower ratings tend to fall off the map. “Important severity level means:\n‘I can patch later’, ‘There are more critical things I should care about.’” Moderate and Low\nvulnerabilities, he said, often are interpreted as ‘We will patch someday’ or ‘Not dangerous at all,’\nCerrudo wrote.\nAnd that becomes problematic when “Important” vulnerabilities are understood to be holes that lack\nurgency, even though a close reading would show that they could facilitate remote compromise of vulnerable\nsystems.\nAs an example of just this problem, Wysopal notes MS10-088, a recent Microsoft bulletin issued regarding\ntwo recent Powerpoint vulnerabilities. Microsoft assigned an “Important” severity rating to the bulletin,\ndespite the fact that they affected a common component of the widely used Office Suite to the hole and\nthat each of the vulnerabilities that were identified would allow an attacker to “take complete control of\nan affected system…” installing their own programs or user accounts and modifying, copying or deleting\ndata.  Both could also be leveraged in Web based attacks by “a Web site that contains a Web page that is\nused to exploit this vulnerability” or “Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content…\n(and) contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.”\nCVSS, on the other hand, rates the MS10-088 vulnerabilities “HIGH” with a score of 9.3 out of 10 – with an\nexploitability sub score of 8.6 out of 10 and impact subscore of 10 out of 10 contributing to the overall\nrating.  In that case, as others, Wysopal argues, Microsoft’s bias towards “wormability” dilutes the\nseverity of vulnerabilities that are the most commonly used tools for compromising individuals and\norganizations today: those sent via the Web and aimed at client side software.  \nWysopal suggests that Microsoft ditch its proprietary severity rating system altogether in favor of the\nCVSS system, which he calls a “more realistic and common standard” that has also been adopted as the basis\nfor NIST’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD)( http://nvd.nist.gov/).\nEmbrace Complexity\nUltimately, any kind of rating system will oversimplify the complex issues that surround vulnerabilities,\nbut researchers say that’s OK. In fact, Microsoft needs to embrace complexity if it is to reform its\nexisting and flawed Severity Rating System.\n“If I were writing a rating system, it would be much more refined,” wrote Miller. “As someone who finds\nbugs for a living, I have to assess the ease of exploitation of bugs all the time, and it is difficult,\nand subjective, but I have to do it in order to move on.”  \nMicrosoft could help by providing more contexts for exploitability that helps shade different\nvulnerabilities and also supports the ratings that are given.\n“Consider the difference between an off-by-one error that allows you to write a null one byte past a\nbuffer compared with a bug that allows you to write an arbitrary amount of arbitrary data past a buffer,”\nMiller offered, as an example. “I think it’d be really interesting if they tried to make a scale from 1-10\nbased on this criteria,” he said.\nJeremiah Grossman, of application security firm WhiteHat Security thinks that severity ratings need to\nembrace complexity, even as they strive to simplify information about vulnerabilities.\n“There are several variables, of varying degrees of real importance, worth considering in a final\nactionable ‘severity’ formula,” he writes. Among them: system severity, exploit difficulty, wormability,\nlocal or remote accessibility, industry knowledge and pervasiveness.\nWhile there might not be an easy or consistent way to weight all those different factors, Grossman\nbelieves that its worth trying, especially if Microsoft can mine its knowledge of exploits and use it to\nhelp rank a decade of vulnerability data. “They might create a new formula, apply it to old and patched\nissues, and see if the resulting severity matches what would be reasonable accurate (in light of passed\nexploits),” Grossman suggested.\nLast: Do No Harm\nDespite their criticisms of elements of Microsoft’s Severity Ratings System, there was broad agreement\namong the experts we contacted that Microsoft should keep some kind of rating system in place – even if it\ndecides not to fix its flaws.\nWhile the Severity Rating System may be more a reflection of the security landscape at the time it was\ncreated than an accurate measure of severity in today’s threat environment, its still much better than\nwhat preceded it:  a ponderous, erratic and overly technical security bulletin system that focused on\ntechnical descriptions of vulnerabilities and patches, without providing much in the way of guidance to IT\npractitioners.\nAfter close to a decade, IT staff has developed a familiarity and understanding of the rating system:\nbuilding patch processes around the company’s monthly Patch Tuesday bulk release, and prioritizing\nactivities based on the Severity Ratings of those patches.\n“I think one of the successes is the predictable patching schedule,” wrote Grossman of WhiteHat. “From the\nstatistics I read on actual breaches, what’s most important in patch management is not necessarily the\nspeed, but the coverage. Predictable schedules, I think, encourage more broad patching coverage.”\nIn short: ten years later, the Severity Rating System, even in its current incarnation, accomplishes its\ncore objective: communicating information about the relative seriousness of security vulnerabilities and\nthe need to patch to a broad audience, our experts agreed. Most said that they’d be loath to throw it out\naltogether.\n“I think the way they do it is meaningful in the way it is intended,” wrote Miller. “The rating system is\ndesigned for enterprise customers to help them decide how quickly they need to patch,” he wrote.\nCerrudo of Argeniss agreed. “The Severity Rating System is how Microsoft communicates to people about what\nvulnerabilities should be patched ASAP or not,” he wrote.\nThe question, these experts say, is whether Microsoft is, in the next decade, willing to commit equivalent\nresources to secure development and improved communication about product vulnerabilities as they have\ncommitted in the past decade.\nSome, like Grossman, worry that the company’s attention may be wandering now that software security isn’t\nperceived of as much of a liability for Microsoft.\n“This is no longer the era of (Microsoft) trying to look more secure than Linux,” wrote Grossman, who has\nblogged on the topic (http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2010/06/microsoft-security-is-good-enough-\nand.html). ”Microsoft won the security PR war long ago. Right or wrong, Adobe and Apple are the new\nwhipping boys now.”\nAnd that may be a lost opportunity for the community, as a whole, he said.\n“We’ve learned a great deal as an industry since 2002. A modern system should take much more into\nconsideration.”\n", "deleted" : false }

Second, TopTopic’s content is closely watched for appropriateness.\nSaïd Amin, CEO and co-founder of TopTopic.\nThe TopTopic site and web app, developed by a team in Seattle, launched publicly Wednesday morning after a successful Indiegogo campaign in October 2015 that allowed the online community to start a private beta for its 60 early adopters.\nLike Reddit, TopTopic has a number of different threads, called “Topics,” that users can read and upvote — a process it calls “topping” a post. Unlike Reddit, TopTopic has strict policies regarding appropriate content, including zero-tolerance for harassment, discrimination, and hate speech, which make the site somewhat of a rarity among online communities, which seem to run on an “anything goes” model for their posts and comment sections.\n“The trolling is out of control,” explained  Saïd Amin , the co-founder and CEO of TopTopic in an interview with GeekWire this week. “Reddit. YouTube. … It’s bad across the board. The loonies are running the asylum. Having had experience in community building, I know that to establish good culture, it needs to start at the outset. … You need to be policing it from the beginning, the first member.”\nTopTopic is also unusual as an online community because it allows users to monetize their posts without resorting to third-party ads, via a process they call “SuperTopping.” Users buy credits on the site called SuperTops, which cost 10 cents each. With a SuperTop, users essentially pay to up-vote posts more than once, with the amount the post rises depending on how many times users SuperTop it.\nThe original author of a SuperTopped post receives 5 cents and TopTopic receives the other 5 cents. Users cannot SuperTop their own posts, and SuperTopping involves an IP address check to prevent users from creating separate accounts to boost their own content.\n I love it when people agree to disagree in a respectful manner. All too often we are in an echo chamber, just hearing what we want to hear\n“We don’t want to do advertising,” Amin said. “This is a community-driven revenue model…If you have this topic you’re passionate about, you’re going to contribute so that more people see will posts about it and to reward the community members who create the type of content that you like to see on the site.”\n“Do you know how many people are on Tumblr posting stuff for free?” he added. “They should do it here instead. They might make several hundred or several thousand dollars over the course of a year.”\nTopTopic co-founder John Skorick\nBeyond its unusual revenue model and strict content standards, TopTopic is a lot like a cross between Reddit and Tumblr, Amin said.\nLike Tumblr, TopTopic offers different content creation tools. Users can create posts with links, photos, videos, audio, text, lists, and polls. Memes will be next, Amin said.\nOnce created, posts go into specific topics created by TopTopic’s members, like Reddit’s subreddits. Those topics can be public or private and involve sophisticated settings like invite-only posting or posts that must be moderator-reviewed before they appear on the Topic page. If users post inappropriate content to a Topic, their posts will be removed, but there is an option to explain to those users how their content violated community standards so that they will know what not to do next time, Amin said.\nMembers of TopTopic, in addition to having different media options for their posts, can also track their content through TopTopic’s analytics section, which provides information about the engagement and revenue generated from a post.\nRight now, TopTopic’s biggest hurdle is building up its member base, Amin said. He believes that there are many members of other online communities who are feeling disillusioned and who looking for alternatives. TopTopic can attract them with its commitment to community respect, he said.\n“When it comes to community, it’s a big deal to me,” Amin said. “I’ve moved my whole life; I’ve traveled to 23 countries; I’m an immigrant. I love it when people agree to disagree in a respectful manner. All too often we are in an echo chamber, just hearing what we want to hear….Much of my life is in the gray and I want to hear different opinions, but also to know I’m in a safe space.”\nTopTopic co-founder Behzad Ghaffarian\nPreviously the founder of  World Singles Networks , an online dating site (where he met his own wife), Amin has experience in building online communities. Feeling tired of the trolls on social media, he decided to build a new online community that would adhere to basic standards of respect, while still fostering creativity and passionate discussion, he said. Once Amin had refined his ideas and pulled together a team, the actual site development for TopTopic took about a year, he said.\nThe company, at least for now, is bootstrapped, said Amin. He doesn’t anticipate fundraising anytime soon because raising capital can require a site to compromise its community’s interests for its investors’ interests, he said. For Amin, the ideal situation would be that TopTopic generates enough revenue from its community members to fuel growth, so it won’t have to cater to any external parties.\nAt TopTopic, Amin is joined by fellow co-founders  Behzad Ghaffarian , who does the front end user interface for TopTopic and also for World Singles Network; and John Skorick , who heads up community engagement strategy at TopTopic while continuing to work on his company, MyAKA, which provides mobile phone security.

But boy have things changed since then. In early 2008 GreenFuel Technologies was still in business, Aurora Algae (then called Aurora Biofuels) was still focusing on fuel, Petro Algae hadn’t yet filed for an S-1, and it was unclear then that Craig Venter’s Synthetic Genomics was going to become a dark horse in the algae fuel world. Here’s our updated 2010 version of our original 15 algae fuel startups bringing pond scum to fuel tanks:\n1). Solazyme: One of the leaders in the algae fuel industry, seven-year-old Solazyme has amassed more than $125 million in funding from high profile investors like oil company Chevron’s VC arm, investors Morgan Stanley, Virgin Group’s Richard Branson, and personal goods product producer Unilever . I toured the factory last year, and while the company isn’t producing commercial-scale algae fuel just yet, it’s currently selling its algae oil for applications like food (yum, algae milk) and products like lotions. Solazyme wants to commercialize its fuel technology in the 2012-2013 time frame, with a production cost target of $60 to $80 per barrel. To get there, it will have to build a commercial-scale algae plant, which can cost over $100 million.\nAdvertisement\n2). Aurora Algae: Formerly called Aurora Biofuels , the newly christened Aurora Algae has been searching for commercial markets today in turning algae into nutrients and protein products, in contrast to the far out markets for algae fuel. That change is not exactly a vote of confidence for the short-term plans of algae-based biofuel startups to bring a cost-competitive replacement for fossil fuels to market. Originally developed at the University of California at Berkeley, the company is using genetics to isolate\nalgae strains that can efficiently create biodiesel. Aurora claims the technology can create biodiesel fuel with yields that are 125 times higher and have 50 percent lower costs than current production methods\nAdvertisement\n3). Synthetic Genomics: Synthetic Genomics — the brainchild of genomics guru Craig Venter — has scored the largest deal with an oil company of all of its competitors: a $600 million partnership with Exxon Mobil. As we put it last year, the deal was so big for the nascent algae fuel industry, it was basically algae’s big break . Synthetics Genomics and Exxon opened an algae test facility at Synthetic Genomic’s HQ in La Jolla, Calif. in June . The greenhouse facility is the first step in figuring out if Synthetic Genomic’s algae fuel can move beyond the lab environment and be produced economically at a larger scale. The next step will be an outdoor facility that the partners will build by 2011.\nAdvertisement\nSynthetic Genomics also had a world-changing breakthrough in May , when Venter officially became God and his team successfully created the first synthetic bacterial cell — in other words, the first artificial life form. A synthetic life form could be uniquely suited to help fight climate change and aid in uncovering new energy sources because a designer organism could be developed to only perform certain tasks, like converting sugar to ethanol, which would result in a very efficient process. Natural microbes have other life priorities like, say, replication, but a synthetic organism can be created to perform one function only.\nAdvertisement\n4). PetroAlgae: PetroAlgae currently trades on the trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol PALG, but in August filed an S-1 for an IPO. PetroAlgae describes its technology as a development of light and environmental management systems that enable algae to grow at four times its natural growth rates. The company says its “secret sauce” is in its software, which can manage  algae harvesting density and sunlight exposure, as well as its remote  sensing system that can measure the algae crop density.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, the company’s business model (conveniently for them) is to have their  customers pay “all upfront infrastructure costs as well as continued  maintenance for their licensed facilities,” in addition to licensing  fees for the first three years of a 20-year license, plus a royalty  stream during the life of the license. I’m pretty skeptical of this company — it’s steadily lost money and has no revenues.\nAdvertisement\n5). Sapphire Energy: Sapphire is another algae fuel heavyweight that hadn’t yet come onto our radar at the time of our original list. Founded in 2007, Sapphire Energy plans to ramp up its production to 1 million gallons of algae-based diesel and jet fuel per year by 2011. By 2018, Sapphire says it will crank out up to 100 million gallons per year, and by 2025, the company says that number will soar to 1 billion gallons per year, which would be about 3 percent of the U.S. renewable fuel standard. So yep, those are some big claims. Sapphire has raised more than $100 million from the likes of Bill Gates’ investment firm Cascade Investment, as well as ARCH Venture Partners, Wellcome Trust and Venrock, a nd so far it has tested its fuel with two commercial airlines : Continental and JAL.\nAdvertisement\n6). Bioalgene: Outta Seattle University, Bioalgene is trying to speed up the process of algae production to an 8-day cycle. The company says three outdoor field tests in 2008 with Washington State University have proven its concepts, and Bioalgene plans to build pilot plant sites in Eastern  Washington.\nAdvertisement\n7). Phycal: Phycal came onto my radar when it won a $24.2 million federal research grant for its algae fuel technology. It’s parent company is Logos Energy, and its based in St. Louis Highland Heights, OH .\nAdvertisement\n8). Live Fuels: Live Fuels has a slightly offbeat new approach to algae fuel, that it’s tweaked since our original list. “We cook ‘em and squeeze ‘em,” LiveFuel’s CEO Lissa Morgenthaler-Jones explained to us, describing her company’s process for turning algae-fed fish into oil for fuel using heat and high pressure. It’s a more gruesome way of harvesting pond scum than the mechanical equipment employed by other startups working on algal fuels. Founded in 2006, LiveFuels kicked off its pilot operations at a 45-acre open pond test facility in Brownsville, Texas, a year ago. The company raised $10 million in May 2007 from David Gelbaum’s quiet Quercus Trust .\nAdvertisement\n9). Solix Biofuels: Solix says its technology is able to be massively scaled, which at the end of the day is the secret that will unlock algae fuel. Specifically Solix describes its technology as proprietary photobioreactors that are ten times more productive than open pond systems. Partners include Valero, Los Alamos National Labs, Colorado State University, and Shanghai Alliance Investment.\nAdvertisement\n10). Aquaflow: The New Zealand company’s goal is to become “the first company in the world to economically produce biofuel from wild algae harvested from open-air environments.” The company is unusual in that it harvests algae from polluted waters and produces biofuels from that harvested algae. So revenue streams can be cleaning up water, and producing biofuels. The company has partnered with Honeywell’s (s HON) UOP.\nAdvertisement\n11). Bionavitas: Four-year-old Bionavitas is still pretty much under the radar, but according to some reports ( like this CNET one ) the company uses long light rods to deliver more light to algae to stimulate growth and to cut the costs of algae farming.\nAdvertisement\n12). Seambiotic: Seambiotic says it’s “the first company in the world that is utilizing flue gas from coal burning power stations for algae cultivation.” The company is seven-years-old and is based in Israel.\nAdvertisement\n13). Bodega Algae: Like several of its competitors Bodega Algae uses closed bioreactors instead of open ponds to grow algae. But the company’s reactors are scalable and stackable, and are meant to be placed next to industrial and municipal waste streams to harvest the algae. Bodega has its roots out of MIT.\nAdvertisement\n14). Algenol: Algenol says it grows hybrid algae to produce ethanol, and has assembled one of the largest collections of blue-green algae strains in the world. To date, the company says it has raised $70 million and it plans to build a pilot-scale biorefinery, and a 100 million to 1 billion gallon of ethanol per year refinery. Algenol says it has partned with Dow Chemical and Valero and has received a $25 million grant from the DOE.\nAdvertisement\n15). General Atomics: OK, it’s not a startup, but San Diego-based nuclear power research company General Atomics has been working on algae fuel technology for the past couple of years and last year scored a $43 million contract with DARPA to create algae-based jet fuel.\nAdvertisement\nFor more research on cleantech financing check out GigaOM Pro (subscription required):\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Now, media conglomerates Star and Sony plan to cash in on this Hollywood rage in a different way.\nSony Liv, the over-the-top services player owned by broadcaster Sony Pictures Networks (SPN) India, and Star India's Hotstar will use Hollywood movies and English TV content to take on Netflix in the Indian market. Hotstar, which claims over 50 million downloads, has launched its first pay wall (Rs 199 per month) with the launch of sixth season of 'Game of Thrones', an HBO original series, along with other TV series. Sony Liv, with over 20 million downloads, has taken the films route and recently launched a subscription service for Bollywood movies.\nIt is banking on its Hollywood library to offer English movies on subscription and plans to offer titles like The Goosebumps, The Angry Birds, Hotel Transylvania and Concussion to its users before their TV premieres on a pertransaction basis for Rs 120.\n\"While we have subscription plan forRs 150 per month, we are offering recent movies on a pay-per-view and transactional VOD basis for Rs 120.

The startup is nearly out of money, and Schorsch says that unless it can raise more funding by the end of April, it will have to shut down on April 30.\nTrusera launched ten months ago, offering users a community where they can share their stories about how they’ve dealt with health conditions. Instead of simply segmenting users into different groups according to the disease they are dealing with, Trusera also takes other information into account, including a user’s hobbies, location, and age. Using this data it tries to match users up with each other, so that their experiences and tips can be shared with the people who stand to gain the most from them. The other benefit of this matching system is that users can elect to receive Email updates whenever a new match submits a story or tip, which means that users don’t have to worry about constantly searching the site for new information.\nTrusera is well designed, with a friendly interface that lends a sense of community that makes the site seem like more than just a reference guide. It also has a few innovative features in the works, like a writing assistant that offers users tips as they write about their experiences (Schorsch assures me that it is nowhere near as annoying as Microsoft’s infamous Clippy).\nBut while it has grown a dedicated user base, it is still fairly small (which isn’t too surprising given that it has been around less than a year). The site faces off with a plethora of competitors in this space, which include everything from similar online portals to more basic forums. Many sites also revolve around individual diseases, which can further segment these communities.\nWhile Trusera may be forced to close at the end of next month, Schorsch says that the company will continue to maintain the website content and platform on private servers, which they can reactivate down the line should they come across new funding.\n", "deleted" : false }

Big and small business alike use social media sites to get their brand across to the always-online consumers of today. Even though it’s easy to view sites like Facebook or Twitter as just another advertising channel, you can’t afford to forget the importance of customer service and engagement via social media. Knowing when and how to communicate with the average online user — especially a dissatisfied or disengaged user — is a must.\nA good or bad customer service experience is all that separates you from attaining brand loyal consumers — or losing them completely. In the 2015 customer service report by Aspect Software , 76 percent of consumers look at customer service as a test of their value to a brand. Additionally, the all-important Millennial demographic said their expectations towards customer service have increased since 2012, as evidenced by the 56 percent that said they switched brands within the past year because of poor customer service. And consumers won’t let you off the hook just by switching — failure to accommodate their expectations may land you on the top page of Reddit .\nEnter social media to the rescue. In our VentureBeat Insight report, Social media management: Tools, tactics … and how to win , we researched the most valuable information regarding social media management tools. By monitoring 1,600 business Twitter accounts, we discovered that 80 percent of the tweets counted were among the top 219 brands, and that the most active Twitter accounts tweeted over 1,600 times in nine days. 9 out of the top 20 brands were in the travel business, such as American Airlines or Southwest Airlines, and were the most responsive to customers.\nOf course, Twitter is hardly the only social media channel to be concerned with. The challenge is consolidation — whether you’re responding to comments on FaceBook or creating brand awareness through Instagram or Pinterest.\nAs social media guru Jay Baer said , “You must unify your social customer service processes and personnel to provide a consistent experience, regardless of channel.” As Baer highlighted from the Social Bankers research , the volume of questions posted on Facebook has increased 26 percent in 6 months. With Facebook’s’ ever growing user base, not having a customer service team in place is inexcusable.\nWith close to 200,000 Twitter followers and growing, Baer is a much turned-to authority figure on social media.

Google is apparently working on an interactive and automated chat app and Facebook announced its Messenger-based customer service initiative last year. Then, just this week, Facebook-owned WhatsApp announced that it was dropping its subscription fee and would instead monetize by letting companies use the messaging service to interact with customers. So while messaging platforms are primarily used today for friend-to-friend communications, we can expect to see that change quickly.\nSo what do companies need to know and what do they need to do to attract and engage customers in this quickly emerging digital dimension? Here are five things to consider:\nTalk is on the decline\nTraditional voice calls as a primary contact for customer support are on the decline. According to a Dimension Data report last year, customer support organizations anticipate a 35 percent drop in voice interactions over the next two years. But customer service inquiries across mobile apps, mobile chat, and social networks will increase more than 20% over the next year, according to Salesforce.com’s State of Service report. My call center company, Aspect Software, recently conducted research on this front and found that if all company contact methods were equal in terms of privacy and ease of use, the use of text-based interaction to solve issues would increase over traditional voice calls by 367 percent. For brands, this means listening to customers and engaging them where they want to be engaged. Don’t make them call you if they’d rather text.\n(Note: Our research is based on a survey of 1,019 Americans 18-65 years of age, with a 25% over-sample of Millennials. It was conducted in October and has a confidence interval of +/- 3.1. Survey takers were contacted by email or text and were individuals who had signed up through various research services to participate in surveys they qualified for.)\nSelf-service will be the new designer experience\nDriving this move away from voice interaction is the desire for consumers to engage companies the way they engage their friends. Our survey found that over 70 percent of consumers want the ability to solve most issues by themselves, mainly due to the anytime-anywhere capability self-directed problem solving provides. We all regularly use text, chat, Facebook, and Twitter to communicate with each other, and consumers are starting to demand those same digital channels be available for customer support interactions. Text-driven, self-driven interaction on digital channels are where Google and Facebook are heading, because that is where global consumers already are.\nIn our survey, three fourths of those polled said that current self-service options prevent them from talking to a representative. Companies need to design these solutions from the consumer’s not the company’s perspective.\nMessaging is where the money is\nFacebook’s purchase of messaging app WhatsApp for $18 billion was eye opening, but then again, HSBC estimated the valuation of China’s WeChat app at over $80 billion. Add in Messenger, Kik, and Snapchat and the total messaging app market evaluation is around half a trillion dollars. But the real value lies in the billions of messaging app users. Six or seven years ago, brands started flocking to social media because that was where consumer conversations where occurring. Today’s customer service has failed to evolve with the times, so Google and Facebook see brand engagement and customer support on messaging platforms following the same path as social.\nOrganizations looking into messaging-based engagement should remember how brands followed consumers into social. Test the waters and expand interaction as customer interest increases.\nConsumers want it\nCustomer service largely remains a “press 1 for this, press 2 for that” experience, forcing customers to interact in ways they find unnatural, mechanized, and frustrating. Not only does this experience fail to solve a customer’s issues, it weakens their connection to the brand. Our research supports a consumer appetite for non-voice interaction: 38% of those polled like the idea of customer service done through texting and messaging.\nCompanies, skittish from the consumer backlash of impersonal and imperfect phone tree self-service need to know that newer, smarter, and more intuitive text-based solutions are entering into the market that avoid the voice menu mazes of the past.\nPeople don’t want to be left hanging\nConsumers know that, notwithstanding their growing preference for text over talk, there are clearly times they just want to engage a live person — and do so without a lot of effort. Our research found that if consumers start a brand interaction with a text or a message, 75% would still want the ability to talk to a live person when needed. No engagement option should be designed or deployed in isolation.\nWe aren’t far from when a basic text message becomes the simple and central entry point to the entire customer service universe. Text, social, and mobile offer the ability to deliver intelligent, automated, interactive text conversations that transform today’s frustrating voice-only phone trees into the ultimate in self-service experiences. These channels hold the potential to better connect companies and their customers in the frictionless way Facebook and Google envision, opening the door to potential first mover advantage for those brands ready to opt-in.\nStew Bloom is CEO of Aspect Software .\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\n", "deleted" : false }

Over half of people, in a recent ClipBlast! survey, said they find videos through their own exploration (53%) or recommendations from others (52%).\nHowever, a sizeable amount (40%) searched for specific videos. What’s surprising are the differences based on sex, as 45% of males searched while 35% of females did so.\nThere was a racial divide reported too: nearly 60% of non-Whites and 35% of Whites reported search activity. It’s hard to say why there’s such a spread, even accounting for survey size.\nBucking the tide, the youngest adults didn’t search videos the most. Some 66% of 25-34 year-olds searched more, as compared with 48% for 18-24; 39% for 35-44; and 28% for 45-54 year-olds.\nOther forms of video findability were lower, including 18% following online recommendations from people they didn’t know; 10% via unsolicited email; and 9% via email or RSS feeds.\nFor now, browsing and sharing are still more important than searching videos.

It let you create small video pop-ups you could stick on your site to say hi to users, or simply to serve as a more attention-grabbing sticky note. Just launched Bubble Comment is a very similar service, and in fact it's from the same folks. The big difference is that it's completely free, albeit with some limitations.\nOne of those limitations, for example, is that you can't simply embed Bubble Comment bubbles on any old page or post--you have to specify which page you're linking your friend to, and Bubble Comment will get the recipient, and your video message to the page page with a re-direct. In other words it's not for publishers, but for people to send links to their buddies. Every message expires after 30 days or 25 views--whichever comes first.\nIf you're looking to send someone a one-off link with a video comment attached it's very cool and completely free. In comparison, parent company kShermanStudios LLC's Bubble Guru requires buying into one of three tiers of service that charges you for how many total messages you want floating around, but offers much more value to blog owners who want to grab your attention in an unusual manner. You just can't help but watch these things, even if the content is lame.\nOther products in the bubble family include Bubble Testimonial , which lets you stick video bubbles of consumer testimonials on your product or service pages, along with Bubble Joy , which is a video e-card service.\nStick your ugly mug on pages you send to friends with Bubble Comment.

I'd be a lot more concerned if they were not.

T\nThese rankings do not necessarily account for hiring freezes; and, so, when job freezes occur, companies do not necessarily pull their job postings. So, consequently, these rankings are a good gauge for comparing IT jobs with other jobs in demand, yet it's really hard to tell if anyone is actually being hired for these openings.\nWhat's number one on this Jobfox ranking ?

The S.F.-based startup has raised close to $20 million in financing since it launched in 2007 with the strategy to bring popular Asian games to the US audience and very successfully implemented a “freemium” model to monetize those games. Some have called Outspark the “envy of the virtual goods space”, at least when it comes to gaming-oriented content. At SXSW earlier this year, Choe reported astonishing ARPPU revenue figures. In an interview with Virtual Goods News, she confirmed that Outspark’s conversion rates were at the high end of the industry average, “in the double digits.”\nDennis Crowley, Co-Founder & CEO, Foursquare\nCheck-ins, badges and mayorships – Foursquare, a service that mixes social, locative and gaming elements to encourage people to explore the cities in which they live, has revolutionized the way millions of people use their cell phones with over 5 million users worldwide and growing.

If there are crashes and time-lags, the user experience is affected. AWS enables us to ensure these do not happen. \nAndre Eikmeier Co-CEO\nAbout Vinomofo\nFounded by Andre Eikmeier and Justin Dry in Adelaide, Australia in 2011, Vinomofo is an online retailer that specializes in sourcing quality wines and providing discount wine deals to consumers. Eikmeier describes Vinomo as “much more than an e-commerce site. Vinomofo is a tribe of people who want to drink wine delivered to their doorsteps with love.” By late 2015, the business was closing in on an AU$60 million (US$43 million) revenue run-rate and its founders were expanding the business into new markets. A dedicated team was establishing a distribution network and business in China, and plans were in development for a launch in the United States.  \nThe Challenge\nWith only limited capital backing the venture, Vinomofo’s founders needed to set up the company’s website quickly and cost-effectively. The website and e-commerce functionality had to be highly available to provide an excellent experience and minimize the risk of customers defecting to rival services due to outages or service slowdowns. The infrastructure supporting the website had to handle growth to several hundred thousand members and support demand peaks during special events. In addition, to compete effectively with competitors and fulfill plans to expand internationally a few years after inception, Vinomofo needed to focus its lean team on business growth and development rather than infrastructure management. Finally, the company needed a secure network to prevent malicious individuals from accessing customer data, disrupting the service, or stealing sensitive business information such as revenue and pricing margins.  \nWhy Amazon Web Services\nVinomofo evaluated the infrastructure as a services marketplace and concluded that Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the only provider that could meet its needs. “In 2011, it was a question of using AWS or running our own servers, storage, networking, and associated infrastructure,” says Cameron Price-Austin, development manager at Vinomofo. “As a cost-sensitive startup, this was the difference between a few dollars per month to rent server instances in the cloud that we can scale according to demand, or tens of thousands of dollars in up-front capital expenditure. It was a pretty easy decision.” Vinomofo then developed a simple website in two months, featuring one wine deal per page per day, and deployed it on an AWS infrastructure.\nThe business has engaged platform-as-a-service provider Engine Yard to undertake support and management of an infrastructure comprising Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to provide server capacity, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store static website images, Amazon CloudFront to provide fast access for users to the website from a range of locations worldwide, and Amazon Route 53 to route users to appropriate web resources to meet requirements. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) runs a MySQL database that stores all Vinomofo user and transaction data, audit trails, logs, and warehousing and fulfillment data including package tracking. This infrastructure operates in the Amazon Asia-Pacific (Sydney) region.\nThe figure below illustrates Vinomofo’s environment in AWS:\nThe Benefits\nRunning in an AWS infrastructure has enabled Vinomofo to focus on its core business and leave non-core activities such as server configuration and management, monitoring, backups, security, and updates to external experts. The business is also delivering more than 99.999 percent infrastructure availability, ensuring Vinomofo users can be confident that the website will be available when they want to take advantage of discount wine deals. “The cloud simply allows what we create to be enjoyed by our customers. If there are crashes and time lags, the user experience is affected. AWS enables us to ensure these do not happen, “says Eikmeier.\nAWS has also enabled Vinomofo to support growth to more than 400,000 members, and adjust its infrastructure usage in line with demand. During non-peak periods, the business has about 100 visitors to its website and this number grows to about 500 visitors after a daily wine-deal email is sent to subscribers. “When special online sales events such as Click Frenzy occur, visitor numbers can climb to about 12,000. In these cases, we double our server capacity about an hour in advance of the event and scale back down about two hours after it finishes. This approach manages the additional demand well,” says Price-Austin.\nWhile Vinomofo has not calculated the cost of running its website in the cloud relative to an on-premises data center, Price-Austin has no doubt that the AWS service is considerably less expensive once data center power, cooling, and real estate is factored into the equation. Running its website in AWS also enables Vinomofo to cut weeks from the time required for development, testing, and staging activities, with Price-Austin noting that the business was able to clone its database in only five minutes to support a recent application development project. “In an on-premises environment, it would take me up to three hours to download a database snapshot, set up, and configure a virtual machine with MySQL from scratch, and load in the snapshot,” Price-Austin says. Vinomofo also has had no major security events with customer and business data is protected within the AWS architecture. “This has helped build customer confidence that they can use our service with minimal risk,” he adds.\nPrice-Austin and Eikmeier plan to leverage AWS resources in regions such as Beijing, China, to help the business grow internationally. Vinomofo is also considering using services such as Amazon CloudWatch to monitor its infrastructure and Amazon Machine Learning to develop predictive analytics, as well as AWS OpsWorks for configuration and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) to process big data for analysis. “As we grew and came onto the AWS radar, the first call we received was from an AWS representative who wanted to help us reduce our cost of using the service,” says Eikmeier. “That support from AWS is what we need to achieve our global ambitions.”  \n", "deleted" : false }

When it was still in private beta, we wrote that Nuconomy was approaching analytics in a new way to try to put more meaning into the data that is thrown back at users, meaning that in many ways it will be more useful than even those hugely expensive alternatives.\nThe tool set is designed specifically for publishers, advertisers and users to better understand and engage with the social web. The platform boasts a data mining engine which continually monitors every aspect of site traffic and user behaviors and automatically highlights the most important things for companies to act on. The main goal is to make web analytics reporting proactive and shorten the time between aggregating and analyzing data, drawing conclusions and taking actions based on the collective intelligence.\nNuConomy’s innovative metrics measure the social elements of digital media, including Flash, AJAX, and Silverlight applications, along with page views, unique visitors, and other traditional metrics. NuConomy also features a two-way API that dynamically changes sites based on current metrics and insights, including the ability to show ads or push specific content relevant to a user’s interests.\nNuConomy was founded in 2006 in Tel Aviv, Israel and is now headquartered in San Francisco, California.

New York's attorney general says that's probably because more than half of tickets to many events are held for industry insiders or otherwise unavailable to the general public.\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a report released Thursday that his investigation of the industry was prompted by consumer complaints, which his office receives regularly.\n\"Ticketing, to put it bluntly, is a fixed game,\" the report said. Investigators found abuses and practices that prevent consumers from buying tickets at affordable prices or sometimes even getting them at all.\nVenues and sellers like Ticketmaster regularly tacked on fees that added more than 21% to the face value, investigators said. They found that on average, 16% of tickets are reserved for various industry insiders like the venue employees, artists and promoters, while 38% are reserved for presales to certain groups like holders of a particular credit card.\nTicketmaster did not immediately reply Thursday to a request for comment.\nInvestigators found that third-party brokers resell tickets on sites like StubHub and TicketsNow at average margins of 49% above face-value and sometimes more than 1,000%. Some brokers use illegal specialty software, called \"ticket bots,\" to quickly purchase as many desirable tickets as possible for resale at significant markups, they said.\nThe report cited a single broker buying 1,012 tickets within one minute to a U2 concert at Madison Square Garden when they went on sale on Dec. 8, 2014, despite the vendor's claim of a four-ticket limit. By day's end, that broker and one other had 15,000 tickets to U2's North American shows.\nA call to Madison Square Garden was not immediately returned Thursday.\nThe attorney general also has reached settlements with two ticket brokers operating without a reseller license. The settlements require one company to pay $80,000 and the other $65,000. They and their principals also must maintain a license.\n\"This investigation is just the beginning of our efforts to create a level playing field in the ticket industry,\" Schneiderman said.\nThe attorney general's office issued a report more than 15 years ago that found New York's ticket distribution system was largely underground and provided \"access to quality seating on the basis of bribes and corruption at the expense of fans.\"\nThursday's report said that despite changes in technology and state law, the problems persist, and event ticketing is the great exception to areas of the economy where online sales have yielded lower prices and greater transparency.\nMadison Square Garden Eric Schneiderman Economy Technology Madison Law New York Madison Square\nCrain's Entertainment Newsletter\nSign up for our FREE weekly email newsletter featuring news coverage of NYC's film, television and Broadway industries.\n", "deleted" : false }

These companies do pay a fee to present, but our coverage of them remains objective.\n[Update (8-10-13): Ticket Playground is now more focused on last-minute event tickets using a geo-centric mobile app to pinpoint buyers and sellers through its marketplace].\nAt first glance, the event-ticket reseller market seems saturated. You have companies like RazorGator , Viagogo , Seatwave and more all vying for the same customers. But TicketPlayground , a new secondary market for tickets launching at the DEMO conference , hopes to distinguish itself by letting users snag tickets at the very last minute, and for less money too.\nMany ticket sites for regular people to buy and sell passes don’t allow people to buy within 72 hours of the event in question. They also usually charge a 15 percent fee to both the ticket seller and buyer. TicketPlayground, on the other hand, only plans to charge 10 percent, and lets you buy within 24 hours of the event you want to attend, whether it be a football game, pop concert, or symphony performance.\nAlso separating it from the pack, the company is adding social networking features into the mix, hoping to foster a regular community of buyers and sellers that come back to the site again and again. Users will be able to blog about the events they attend, chat with other users in real time, and post pictures from the shows and games they go to for others to see.\nTaking advantage of viral marketing, the company is also offering a widget that people can put on their personal sites, blogs or profiles, to funnel traffic back to the TicketPlayground site.\n“We want to combine a marketplace with social applications, where people can buy or sell their tickets, and come onto the site and chat about what’s coming up and what they’ve done,” said CEO Todd Chitoff.\nTicketPlayground has already created mobile applications for the iPhone and BlackBerry. App users will be able to receive text alerts about upcoming events and pre-sales.\nWithin a year, the company plans to be in every major metropolitan market in the U.S. At the same time, it is looking to forge alliances with at least one large network, web site or media company that can help co-market TicketPlayground and expand its reach. Team or sports sites could present an ideal opportunity to make this happen, Chitoff says.\nRight now, the Plantation, Fla. company has some seed and angel funding, but will look for more probably within the year.

Want it by email? Sign-up here .\nAd Bloat\nThe ad-blocking trend is often laid at the doorstep of publishers and their ad tech partners, but there’s plenty of blame to go around. The Wall Street Journal examines the role of agencies and brands in perpetuating the enormous file sizes that damage user experience, especially in mobile. Forbes CRO Mark Howard tells the Journal that “agencies will frequently supply Forbes with ads that are four to nine times larger than Forbes’ specs.” And! ”Agencies will often send the ad information late, even if sites require that creative gets delivered three days before the start of a campaign.” For shame.   \nSEOlden Days\n“Since introducing AdWords 15 years ago, we’ve seen a fundamental change in the way people find what they want,” writes Google VP of product management Jerry Dischler in a blog post . The decline of web sessions into smaller (harder-to-reach) mobile “moments” requires new visualization and reporting, which Google has provided with a revamped UI. Dischler says the changes will unfold over the next two years, so there’s no rush. More at Ad Age .\nApple Tried\nIn a eulogy for iAd, Smaato CEO Ragnar Kruse writes for TechCrunch that Apple’s restrictive policies doomed the mobile ad network. He says those rules inhibited the use of data, limited the creative process and isolated advertisers from global markets. As a result, fill rates plummeted. “The move toward an open ecosystem has become a necessary one to stay competitive in ad tech, but wasn’t a concession Apple was willing to make.” More .\nA Bitter Pill\nThese are tough times for health care marketers, Christine Birkner writes for Adweek. The erosion of print and the ascendance of mobile formats that aren’t good at showing complementary data – warnings, qualifications and usage directions - has flustered big pharma. And then there’s the prospect of a direct-to-consumer ad ban. \"Sixty percent of people get their first piece of health information from going online, or emailing their friends or checking social media,” says Jane Parker, CEO at the Omnicom health care specialist agency Interbrandhealth. “To say you're going to ban this kind of advertising, why go there?” More .\nSunk Costs\nRumors of a Yahoo bid have caught Microsoft’s attention. The company has been meeting with private equity firms with interest in the legacy search and email provider to discuss financing. No deal has been struck yet, but Microsoft’s interest makes a Yahoo buyout all the more serious , despite CEO Marissa Mayer’s desire to turn the company around herself. “If Microsoft put in a billion, it would cost them almost nothing,” an investor who spoke with the company said. “It’s a minor thing and it buys them a lot.”\nBut Wait, There’s More!\n", "deleted" : false }

One of those execs is Mac Delaney, who served as SVP of programmatic for Starcom Mediavest (SMG) before becoming Merkle’s VP and head of programmatic.\nDelaney spoke with AdExchanger about his transition and the changing face of the agency holding company.\nAdExchanger: Why did you move to Merkle?\nMAC DELANEY: The future agency model has DNA that doesn’t currently exist in today’s agency world. A big part of it is understanding audience segmentation, going all the way back to direct mail. I would extend that further and say, the future agency model is capable of handling your entire customer database.  I always tried to work [in disruptive areas] in my career: Federated Media/John Batelle was kind of the precursor to native. I was early in at Yahoo when we built the performance division. This move was a bet I saw other agency [executives] like Gerry Bavaro [who  moved to Merkle  from Omnicom’s Resolution Media] making.\nAnd the media component?\nOn top of database knowledge, you’d have an expertise in systems integration, and be able to consult with a marketer on how you understand audiences across different platforms and environments, and help them discover and learn more about their customers. You’d have key tactical components like social, SEO, email, display and programmatic, specifically. The last piece [is] where traditional agencies are holding on – you’d be able to buy tonnage of media based on relationships that you have, which help you negotiate.\nWhich is harder? The media or the systems integration part?\nThe hardest thing to do is to be the systems integrator. You look around the marketplace and see why agencies are encroaching on one another. The consultant firms have systems integration, but don’t have marketing or media buying experience per se, or database management to link it all together.\nAnd then you have companies like Merkle. Although we’re in a category with Acxiom and Epsilon, we [can] activate audience segments and bring them into the marketing environment and optimize creative because of our acquisitions over the last 10 years.\nMerkle’s history is as a CRM/database agency, but has moved aggressively into media and programmatic. Is this symptomatic of all the recent ad/mar tech mergers?\nOur value prop is marrying old-school data management and marketing with new sources of data. And you see that through [Merkle’s] acquisitions and integrations.\nIn order to talk about addressable marketing beyond the cookie, you need to marry foundational data management with how things are activated in the cookie-based and post-cookie world. You have some holding companies saying, “Our CRM databases are now plugged into Facebook,” but beyond the press release, when a client asks how it works, you need agencies who speak that vernacular and Merkle is one of the companies doing that.\nWhat do you make of all these agency holding companies investing in tech?\nOwning technology is incredibly hard. If you’re Google, Yahoo, AOL, technically both media and bona fide tech [companies], it can be done. But ensuring that technology stack is on the bleeding edge compared to its competition is incredibly hard. So is integration. Every single company that’s made acquisitions to build a complete stack has that challenge. Google did in launching DBM (DoubleClick Bid Manager) and it took a good, long while to integrate Teracent and analytics and Invite Media. Adobe, the same.\nThe moment a company from outside that category, such as an agency, acquires technology, the clock starts ticking around how long will it take for that feature/capability/algorithm to be antiquated. The agency has to be very careful about what it buys versus what it builds or partners for. SMG buying a future-forward DMP and DSP [like RUN] – it has to be very surgical and make good, financial sense.\nIf you’re a client, you expect your agency to buy technology. I don’t know if that is a DSP for $500 million, but I do believe you need to understand the data management component. If you’re a client today and your agency hasn’t made an investment anywhere, you’d be wondering why and what’s taking so long.\nMerkle was an early partner for Facebook’s and Google’s cross-device tools. How do you broach the issue of data ownership with clients?\nMerkle is drawing a distinction between addressable and non-addressable marketing. When you leverage cookies, there will be an inherent imperfection. But given your ability to decide what percentage of your mix will be based on second- and third-party data, you could still make the “first” generation of addressable back out for you. This is where Merkle sees a lot of opportunity – linking the addressable, known customer database to, “We need to build audience segments based on ‘X’ five signals.”\nBeginning now, with Google launching Customer Match, and Facebook with Atlas, those are giant, addressable one-to-one solutions, which will change the role of the agency. … [T]he complexities that arise from walled gardens underscore the need to have an unbiased, unconflicted partner in an agency who can help manage all of that. There is no smoke and mirrors when buying audiences in the digital world as there were five years ago.\nThe interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n", "deleted" : false }

[Meanwhile,] the main use of live streaming has been life-streaming, like Justin.tv or Chris Pirillo, and I just don’t think that’s compelling, and I think that’s borne out by the viewership.”\nAdvertisement\nGoldenson said 10 to 20 percent of PlayCafe visitors just watch the game rather than playing themselves, which is interesting in and of itself, but especially when compared to television game shows.\nAdvertisement\nWe’d heard elsewhere that First Round Capital had made an investment in the company, which Goldenson confirmed, though he declined to state the amount as he said the funding round is still open. While we think this is a cool idea, we’re surprised the company was able to raise cash with such low user numbers. But Goldenson and his partner Dev Nag have had success with previous startups, and also have PayPal and Google on their resumes.\nAdvertisement\nGoldenson, who said the company’s goal is to run games around the clock, vouched that newly hired producer Jon Lawrence, who ran Take the Cake and Midnight Money Madness for Endemol, will bring a “better look and feel” to the site. Goldenson called the current set-up (see embed above) “authentic but not very sophisticated.”\nAdvertisement\nLast week we wrote about another funded startup looking to combine casual gaming and web trivia, but that one’s called PopJax , and does on-demand trivia games rather than live shows.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

Enormous amounts of money slosh from border to border on the “forex” market, as it’s called—the equivalent of several trillion dollars each business day. Giant investment banks like Deutsche Bank, UBS, and Citi are the biggest traders, but thanks to the emergence of “retail” forex brokers such as FXCM—the currency-trading equivalents of online trading houses E*Trade or Schwab—it’s possible for individuals to play the forex market as well.\nBut currency trading can be a lonely, scary pastime for individuals. For good reason: most forex brokers allow account holders to leverage their trades at ratios of 100:1 or more (meaning they can put 100 borrowed dollars to work for every dollar of their own), so they can turn a tiny percentage change in the value of one currency against another into a huge gain in a matter of minutes—but just as easily lose their entire stake. As the FXCM website blandly states , “Trading foreign exchange with a high or even moderate level of leverage may not be suitable for all investors.”\nNow there’s an online community based in Boston’s historic North End where forex traders can collaborate, share strategies, educate one another about the opportunities and risks of currency trading, and exchange kudos (or sympathy notes). It’s called Currensee . It’s currently in an invitation-only, beta-testing phase, but CEO Dave Lemont says the site will open to the general public this summer.\n“It’s a very exciting asset class to trade in,” Lemont says of the forex market. Unlike the stock exchanges, currency trading isn’t plagued by bear markets, since a decline in one currency always means a gain for some other currency. (Making a profit is just a matter of picking the right side.) But one problem for traders, says Lemont, is that they’re alone a lot. “Currency trading is a 24-hour opportunity, because the markets rotate in their opening hours. So you might be at home on your computer at night while the kids are asleep, still trading,” he says. “Like anything you do, it’s an important decision, and you’re using your own money, so you want validation from other people. We are social people—we like to have interaction.”\nBlogs and message boards provide some of that interaction. But it’s hard to know whether the people sharing their opinions online are putting their money where their mouths are. “I could be telling you to go long on the euro, but maybe I haven’t made a trade in two years,” says Lemont. “We would like to get other people’s opinions, but we like the opinions of trusted sources—information that is backed up by someone’s own trading history.”\nThe whole idea with Currensee—and the source of the name—is that members must be active currency traders, and are encouraged to let other members see information about their trading positions and performance, in the form of account data streamed directly from the sites of their online brokers, such as FXCM.\nCurrensee has many of the trappings of a Facebook or a MySpace, including personal profiles and friend networks, but Lemont says the company doesn’t use the social networking label. “We call it a ‘forex decision-making network,'” he says. “What we mean by that is that we try to take the real trades that people are making and provide information about those trades—either the trades themselves, or aggregated data—back to members, to help them make decisions about the trade they’re in or the next trade they’re going to make.”\nCurrensee’s co-founders are Israeli natives Avi Leventhal and Asaf Yigal. Leventhal is a longtime independent currency trader who offers forex courses and lectures around the world. (Which is a big business unto itself, by the way: “It’s easy to be unsuccessful just by doing it wrong,” Lemont says, so it’s advisable to seek training before you start trading with real money.)

Danny Socolof and Jeff Henshaw think they can bring concerts onto the Web with their startup DeepRockDrive. Socolof is a veteran music marketer and Henshaw hails from Microsoft, where he was on the Xbox team. With DeepRockDrive, they want to film concerts in their high-tech Las Vegas soundstage, broadcast them live over the Web, and sell tickets for $6.99 each, splitting the proceeds with the musicians.\nThe startup—which has raised $3 million in angel funding from Socolof, Henshaw, David Goldberg (founder of Launch Media and the first GM of Yahoo Music), Bill Curbishley (manager of The Who and Robert Plant), and the Becker Family (Brian Becker is the former CEO of Live Nation)—has already quietly recorded and broadcast 45 shows since last September. That was its beta period. Now, on Tuesday, it will be launching itself in a more public fashion with a concert coinciding with the Consumer Electronics Show (which is taking place in Las Vegas next week). It plans on filming more than 100 shows in 2008, plus free promotional shows every Friday.\nHere is how it works. The band plays in the soundstage (with or without a live audience). The shows are filmed with five Sony HD cameras, and each Web viewer can pick which camera angle he or she wants to watch. The audience can also vote on the order of the songs on the set list or make their own song requests. They can also send in messages during the show that the band sees on large screens surrounding the stage. Prior to shows (DeepRockDrive calls them socialcasts), bands try to drum up support with digital posters on their Websites and MySpace pages that fans can take and put on their own Web pages. On DeepRockDrive, fans can petition for concerts from their favorite bands, like this one for Flight of the Conchords . If the shows get enough votes, it makes it easier for the bands to decide to fly to Las Vegas to record the show.\nWhile the experience of watching a live show on your computer screen will never match actually being at a live concert, DeepRockDrive is offering a distributed fan base an opportunity to watch a show from bands that might never otherwise come to their towns. For instance, Australian rocker Shannon Noll is going to do a DeepRockDrive concert aimed at expat Australian fans in the U.S. Declares Socolof:\nThe future of the music business will be hundreds of thousands of artists that have fan bases of between 5,000 to 100,000, not 50 artists that have one million or more.\nSocolof is also talking to music labels (both indies and the majors) about possible joint ventures. Traditionally, labels did not have much to do with the concert side of the business, but that is changing. Predicts Socolof:\nIn the old world, yes, concerts were separate from the labels. In the new world, there will be a different approach in the partnership between labels and their artists. Labels will need to contribute more to the success of their artists.\nMaybe. I don’t think the artists want to start splitting concert fees with the labels. Socolof is also not opposed to rewarding fans who turn out to be the biggest promoters of shows, although there is no mechanism yet for them to be rewarded. (Free tickets for anyone who generates a certain amount of sales wouldn’t be a bad start. Flying the biggest fans/promoters in for the show would be even better).\nDeepRockDive is starting small. Its socialcasts can support only a few thousand simultaneous viewers right now. That will grow to tens of thousands in a few months. “Our goal is a million front row seats,” says Socolof. Hey, the guy is a music promoter.\nHere is an archived video of a band called Socratic. It starts off slow, but you get a sense of what the performance space looks like with large screens filled with live messages from the Web audience:\n", "deleted" : false }

But are those a fair basis to assess a person's mental capabilities?\nEveryday language suggests maybe not. We speak of street smarts and EQ, for instance. Both terms suggest that there are abilities that deserve to be considered as forms of intelligence but that fall well beyond the scope of traditional academic measures. Does science go along with common sense in seeing that intelligence and IQ are far from the same thing?\nMore than you probably imagine. According to Harvard's Howard Gardner, intelligence actually comes in an incredible eight flavors. In a recent video for Big Think the developmental psychologist outlined not just the two kinds of intelligence he believes IQ tests capture -- language and logical (other academics break IQ into different components ) -- but also listed another six types of intelligence these tests fail to measure at all.\n1. Musical intelligence.\n\"People say, well, music is a talent. It's not an intelligence. And I say why, if you're good with words, is that an intelligence, but if you're good with tones and rhythms and timbres, it's not. And nobody's ever given me a good answer, which is why it makes sense to talk about musical intelligence,\" Gardner points out.\n2. Spatial intelligence.\nThis is the easy grasp of how things lay in space that allows a chess master to win or a surgeon to perform near miracles. It's also \"what an airplane pilot or a sea captain would have. How do you find your way around large territory and large space,\" Gardner notes.\n3. Bodily kinesthetic Intelligence.\nForget the cliché of the dumb jock. Coordinating your body actually takes a great deal of intelligence -- just not the kind measured by IQ tests. This type of smarts \"comes in two flavors. One flavor is the ability to use your whole body to solve problems or to make things, and athletes and dancers would have that kind of bodily kinesthetic intelligence. But another variety is being able to use your hands or other parts of your body to solve problems or make things. A craftsperson would have bodily kinesthetic intelligence\" too, according to Gardner.\n4. Interpersonal intelligence.\nThis one seems a bit similar to the popular concept of EQ . \"Interpersonal intelligence is how you understand other people, how you motivate them, how you lead them, how you work with them, how you cooperate with them,\" says Gardner, who adds that it's a particularly important type of intelligence for leaders to have .\n5. Intrapersonal intelligence.\nIntrapersonal intelligence, or self-knowledge, is both very hard to assess and very important, Gardner says, particularly in today's fast-changing world. \"Nowadays, especially in developed society, people lead their own lives. We follow our own careers. We often switch careers. We don't necessarily live at home as we get older. And if you don't have a good understanding of yourself, you are in big trouble,\" he explains.\n6. Naturalist intelligence.\nThis one is \"the capacity to make important, relevant discriminations in the world of nature between one plant and another, between one animal and another. It's the intelligence of the naturalist, the intelligence of Charles Darwin,\" Gardner says.\nAnd before you argue that you live in Detroit or Manhattan and so have no need for this type of smarts, he adds that \"everything we do in the commercial world uses our naturalist intelligence. Why do I buy this jacket rather than another one? This sweater rather than another one?\" Those fine distinctions are made by the part of the brain that used to discern a tasty small animal from a poisonous one. \"When an old use of a brain center no longer is relevant, it gets hijacked for something new. So we're all using our naturalist intelligence even if we never walk out into the woods,\" Gardner concludes.\nIf this sounds like a long list of intelligences, then be warned -- even more may be on the way. In the complete video , Gardner goes on to note their are two other possible intelligences that he is currently investigating.\nThe bottom line? If you've been thinking of your mental horsepower solely in terms of high school report cards or a single number from an IQ test, you're probably selling yourself short. And if you're focusing your energies only on boosting your book learning, you may be wasting efforts that could be better focused on other strengths.\nDo you recognize any of these six additional intelligences in yourself?\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\nPublished on: Jan 29, 2016\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

And now, with spring approaching, Mobile World Congress in Barcelona has folks from around the globe marveling at how interconnected we are with all our smart stuff and proselytizing about how much more connected and smart all our stuff is soon going to be.\nCES overflowed with smart kitchens , smart cars , smart clothes , smart shoes , smart pianos , smart showers , smart beds . The Internet of Things (IoT) dominated the desert, and this week we’re seeing a repeat performance in Barcelona. “ 5G ” is buzzing at Mobile World Congress with its requirements for supporting hundreds upon thousands of simultaneous connections for massive sensor deployments. Cisco followed up its recent acquisition of IoT-focused cloud provider Jasper with an announcement of it’s 5G plans in partnership with Ericsson. Nokia broadcast its massive 5G investment capacity, with president and CEO Rajeev Suri stating , “5G must happen fast because important IoT use cases demand it.”\nAbove: Connected shoe — Mobile World Congress 2016\nImage Credit: Mobile World Congress\nMicrosoft, Intel, Cisco, and a host of tech heavy hitters announced a collaboration a few days ago in the latest bid to unify IoT standards . And the GMSA is displaying the fruits of its Mobile IoT Initiative with live demonstrations of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) solutions in licensed spectrum, highlighting very low cost, mobile operator-connected devices. Mobile World Congress also inaugurated a pavilion dedicated entirely to IoT this year, even though each of the other eight themed pavilions will still be highlighting their own IoT concepts and contributions.\nAnd it won’t stop there.\nAbove: Connected bike — Mobile World Congress 2016\nImage Credit: Mobile World Congress\nAbove: Connected luggage — Mobile World Congress 2016\nImage Credit: Mobile World Congress\nLanyrd.com lists 126 international conferences scheduled throughout the rest of the year devoted to IoT, and a further 286 events dedicated to IoT’s amalgamation of big data, sensors, and connectivity in growing smart cities, factories, water systems, and skyscrapers, among other smart and connected endeavors.\nYou can now slap some sensors and APIs together to make almost any object “smart.” But to what end? Will these mountains of chattering smart things liberate and elevate humanity or leave us device-dependent and drowning in complexity?\nConnection and cognition: IoT doubles down\nWith announcements about new gadgets and new networks and the next big IoT “thing” seemingly churning in an endless cycle, it may feel like we’re going nowhere, but there are grounds to believe this technology really could elevate us. The confluence of corporate collaboration in creating a new network that can actually facilitate IoT’s tremendous potential is the real source of all the 5G hoopla at Mobile World Congress. With 5G, extremely remote devices and extremely low-power applications could finally be feasibly and constantly connected: exponentially expanding the applicability of IoT models. Even non-IoT-related companies such as Facebook see what a game changer this is going to be and are dipping into the action.\nAnd what are we to do once everything is connected and generating a deluge of data? In her keynote back at CES, IBM’s Ginni Rometty touched on some of the possibilities, as embodied in everyone’s favorite Jeopardy champion.\nUsing the example of opening APIs to IBM’s cognitive computing workhorse Watson as a cloud platform, Rometty talked of linking large ecosystems together to enable rich and contextual decision-making (or assisted-decision-making) with compute power and analysis. We have now entered “The Cognitive Era,” where data is the prized natural resource. Data, which was previously copious but invisible, is now available to the masses, though in raw form. In the world of continuous inputs and updates and changes and dependencies, we must be able to make sense of it all almost instantly—which would seem overwhelming and impossible. But Watson’s cognitive model demonstrates that, by adding powerful machine “thinking” to the equation, actions become less dependent on individual intuition and more reliant on vast historical data. Remember those smart shoes? Watson will now work with them to provide coaching and fitness advice to the wearer. Watson is also enabling Medtronic devices to warn diabetics about low blood sugar, helping appliance manufactures trace buried design flaws, and aiding robots in providing humanized customer service, among other endeavors. Moreover, by collecting data from devices used by consumers and “learning” through advanced analytics, Watson has achieved the ability to predict useful future services.\nComplexity can be mitigated; data can be mastered\nThe Watson model argues that, through open APIs and purposeful applications, it is possible to shape the rough beast that is the nascent IoT into a transformative marvel to be welcomed, not dreaded. When everything becomes digital—and 5G indicates that everything eventually will do just that—the ability to make our linked systems think, learn, and understand the ensuing data will be the differentiating factor.\nRegardless of the hype, CES and MWC do not reveal an IoT revolution, but they certainly show us a determined evolution, where devices will unceasingly become more connected, open, and smart. The industry is driving towards a landscape where data can be accessed and made to be useful to any consumer anywhere on the planet. The complexity of IoT is being pulled into platforms that are capable of collecting, storing, analyzing, and exposing information that can be used to create easily accessed, simple, and meaningful consumer services and applications—a promising trajectory for the IoT.\nLeon Hounshell is CTO of Greenwave Systems .

Today, it’s launching a new online action game called Divine Souls that it hopes will spur demand for online market games with faster action and better graphics.\nA lot of online games are stuck in two dimensions, or they cost a lot of money, or they take a huge amount of time to play. Outspark’s games are free-to-play, but the company’s betting that the quality of Divine Souls is so good, it will lure in players at both ends of the market: those who are tired of casual games and want more and those who are tired of spending a lot of money on games that take forever to master.\nOf course, Outspark could also be hammered by rivals at both ends of the online game spectrum — casual Facebook game companies such as Zynga and hardcore massively multiplayer online game makers such as Blizzard Entertainment. Outspark’s bet is that the middle of the market isn’t a No Man’s Land.\nWill the game be popular? It all depends on how fast you want to see the action when you’re pummeling a monster with one sword stroke after another in a kind of endless chain of attacks. Susan Choe, chief executive of San Francisco-based Outspark, calls her target market the “mid-core gamers.” These include both downloadable and light-download browser-based games where users can start playing for free but pay real money for virtual goods in small transactions as they progress.\nChoe founded Outspark in 2007 to bring Asia’s popular free-to-play online games to the U.S. market, mainly because about 6,000 wealthy users in the U.S. will generate as much revenue as 100,000 users in China. The company has managed to grow its audience to a couple of a million users a month (and 7.5 million registered users), although its current monthly user counts are likely below its past peaks. That’s why Divine Souls is such an important game for the company.\nWith Divine Souls, Outspark didn’t just take a published game from Asia and re-publish it in the U.S. It teamed up with Korean game developer Gameprix and co-produced the game, which is a fast-paced, arcade-style fighting game with rich 3D graphics, including support for 3D glasses.\n“We worked on this one from the beginning to the end,” said Philip Yun, chief operating officer of Outspark.\nHe said that Gameprix’s team of 80 developers worked on the title since 2008, with help from about 11 staffers at Outspark. That’s considerably more effort than usually goes into free-to-play games. The goal was to create a combat game with fluid motion, said Yun. He says the game isn’t merely repetitive, but it requires a skillful gamer for success in fighting. The game also uses sophisticated physics, which isn’t that common in free-to-play online titles. The download size is also fairly small. Closed beta tests began in October.\nAccording to Choe, Divine Souls is the first of a number of titles that were developed in a similar way. Other titles will include first-person shooter games, real-time strategy titles, role-playing games and other genres as well.\nLast year, rumors surfaced that Outspark was in talks to be acquired by China’s Shanda Games, but no deal came out of those talks. Outspark  raised $8.3 million in venture funding during the dry month of July, 2009 and has raised $22 million to date. Investors include DCM, Syncom Venture Partners, SBI Investment, Mille Plateau, Tencent and Altos Ventures. Rivals are plentiful, from Nexon to Jagex. On the consoles, games such as Mortal Kombat will compete with Divine Souls. Is it “AAA” quality? The graphics look good, though not spectacular. Gamers will decide.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

Kids seem to pick up on new languages so easily, but once you're a bit older... well, it's tough to learn new skills in general.\nAnd it can be expensive, too. There are a ton of costly options, from online courses to night school to full college or university courses.\nWhat you may want to try first is a free online course. There are some great options ranging from beginner and intro-level courses to conversational courses, to comprehensive ones that will leave you fluent in the language of your choice. These free courses let you dip your toes in the pool, in a sense, to see if you really want to invest your time in learning this new language.\nBecoming fluent, or even just mastering enough of a language to carry a conversation, can be a huge help if you're considering expanding your business into a new market, or accepting a job in another country. Some languages can even help you do better business here at home.\nBefore you throw down a whack of cash on a language learning system, check out these 9 places you can learn a new language online for free:\n1. Duolingo\nNot only is Duolingo useful when learning a new language, it's fun and addictive. This service takes a game-like approach to learning and offers apps for iOS, Windows Phone and Android. To get started, you create a profile and either launch a beginner's course, or take a test to move into an advanced lesson (if you already know the basics). Duolingo is one of the \"pure\" free services that promises it'll be free forever.\n2. Open Culture\nOpenCulture can help you learn one a popular language like English, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, or Mandarin. But there are a total of 48 language options listed on this portal to free language course downloads. Farsi/Persian, Estonian, Icelandic, Gaelic and many other languages are available here, often as free mp3 downloads you can load up and listen to later.\n3. Livemocha\nLivemocha gives you access to free lessons for 35 languages, but also offers a vibrant community of native language speakers from 190 countries you can connect with to practice your speech.\n4. Babbel\nYou can learn 14 new languages with Babbel , including English, French, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish and more. While some online language learning platforms focus strictly on speech, Babbel teaches you speak, read and write in the language of your choice. There are beginner courses available for free, and you can upgrade to a paid course if you choose, with prices as low as $6.95 a month, if you sign on for one year.\n5. Busuu\nOne of the more popular platforms, Busuu boasts over 50 million native language users. Its approach is unique, as you will become part of a social community that allows you to learn languages from others. They offer the GSET (Global Scale of English Tests) certification, as well, if you've been practicing English and want to see where you stand.\n6. Learn a Language\nIf a simple learning experience is what you want, Learn a Language is good option. Created by the U.S. Institute of Languages to help people bridge communication gaps caused by differences in language, it's based on the Visual Link teaching methodology developed by David S. Clark.\n7. Mango Languages\nMango has a massive repository of language lessons for over 60 languages including Spanish, Swahili, Punjabi, Icelandic and more. It's unique in that it was the first film-based language and culture learning system on the market. With both a web-based system and app availability, you can learn from home, the office, or while on the go. You can purchase Mango for $20 a month, or access it free at any public library in the United States or Canada.\n8. Transparent Language\nTransparent Language offers paid language courses with a free trial, or you can sign up here to receive free language-learning resources by email. They cover over 100 different languages, so if you're looking for something slightly obscure or have had trouble finding your language of choice elsewhere, definitely give this a try.\n9. Surface Languages\nSurface Languages is a decent choice if you're traveling to a new region for work and just want to pick up some conversational cues before you go. It uses audio, flashcards and some language learning games to teach words and phrases you might encounter in common situations in another country.\nLike this column?

Factors like intense competition, rapid advances in technology, and frequent changes in consumer preferences pose significant challenges for this market as they negatively impact the revenue generating capacity of the vendors. In this market, the vendors compete on the basis of benefits and pricing to gain a competitive edge over their rivals.\nThe increasing number of sporting events is a major trend witnessed in the market. Sporting events such as the Olympics, FIFA, Super Bowl, and Cricket World Cup are gaining high traction and are watched by millions of the population across the world. The growing passion for such sports is attracting higher numbers of people to witness the event at the venue, which is increasing the number of tickets being sold each year, resulting in high growth in the global secondary tickets market.\nAccording to the report, high returns for low investment is a key driver in the market. The secondary market consists of several providers selling event tickets at various price ranges. Secondary ticket providers buy the event tickets in bulk, when their cost is low. As the date of the event approaches and the demand increases, resellers start selling the tickets at an increased price, which increases their revenue.\nFurther, the report states that the availability of live broadcasts on television is a major challenge witnessed in the market as these eliminate the need for a viewer to watch the show at the event venue.\nKey questions answered in the report:\nWhat will the market size and the growth rate be in 2020?\nWhat are the key factors driving the global secondary tickets market?\nWhat are the Key Market trends?impacting the growth of the global secondary tickets market?\nWhat are the challenges to market growth?\nWho are the key vendors in the global secondary tickets market?\nWhat are the market opportunities and threats faced by the vendors in the global secondary tickets market?\nTrending factors influencing the market shares of the EMEA, Americas, and APAC?\nWhat are the key outcomes of the five forces analysis of the global secondary tickets market?\nKey vendors are:\n", "deleted" : false }

But how do top game publishers like Kabam, Zynga, and Supercell get there … and stay there?\n“It starts with having a great game,” RTB  founder Fred Hsu told me. “You can hope the app gods will grace you and push your game up the charts, but the odds are low … it may happen, but it’s a one in 10,000 chance.”\nHsu’s company, RTB, runs a significant fraction of mobile ads bought via automated real-time bidding. Currently, the company is handling three billion impressions every day and reaching hundreds of millions of users every month. In other words, this man knows his ads. And mobile gaming companies are among his biggest customers.\nOften, the campaign starts in Australia or New Zealand.\n“We see a lot of soft bursts, where companies spend some cash to gobble up users in Australia and New Zealand,” Hsu says. “They want to be a big fish in a small pond … it gives them the best proxy to raise a bigger budget for a broader launch in North America or Western Europe.”\nNew Zealand and Australia are closely aligned with Western countries in taste and style, not to mention language, so they provide a good first audience. Often, the path looks like a global stepping stone: New Zealand to Australia, Australia to Canada, and Canada to the United States. It’s a step-by-step approach that ensures game mechanics, monetization mechanisms, and user acquisition and retention models make sense and are working well before publishers enter the big markets, where they need to spend real marketing dollars.\nThose mechanics include cohort analysis to measure app drop-out, attrition, and the costs of replacing lost users. And the specifics of those mechanics will drive ad spend and velocity.\n“Ultimately, what app developers need is high-quality users to come in their game,” Hsu told me. “They don’t need people who install their game just because they wanted 3,000 fuzzy points for some other cute game.”\nIn addition, they need scale.\nAdding 500 users in a Facebook promotion is fine, but doesn’t move the needle. Big games need big users — hundreds of thousands, if not millions — and to do that, you need marketing scale. That’s why mobile marketing works, Hsu says. Not only do you have huge numbers of targeted users, you’re also hitting them right where they need to be in order to install the game.\nSeeing these campaigns over and over, Hsu says, makes RTB feel like IBM or Mackenzie — consultants who see the same problems many times in different games by different publishers. According to Hsu, there are six key mistakes that gaming companies who fail make:\nNot optimizing the landing page: “Some gaming companies don’t realize how important it is how your app pages looks,” Hsu says. “If you have two stars and lousy images, it’ll probably drive a lot of users away.”\nHaving a subpar game: “What’s your DNA?  Are you really a hardcore gaming company? If not, you might spend a lot of money and forever run into a wall,” Hsu said.\nIgnoring your analytics infrastructure: If you don’t understand your cohorts, your attrition, user acquisition costs, and the lifetime value of a user, you’re setting yourself up for failure.\nCrossing your fingers and wishing for organic luck: Wishing for luck is not a business strategy — nor a winning one.\nSpending massively in the U.S. before testing elsewhere: “If you’re Zynga or Supercell, you know what you’re doing, and you have great product quality, you can start in fifth gear,” Hsu said. Everyone else should walk before running.\nThinking they can do it themselves: “I realize this is almost self-serving, but especially the smaller studios are very scrappy. They think they can just go onto Millennial Media or Admob and just test this themselves,” Hsu says. “But if you don’t do it right, you may come up with conclusions that are wrong.”\nHsu knows a little about growing businesses. He founded domain registry and marketing firm Oversee in 2000 and then sold a minority stake in 2008 for $150 million, all without outside funding. (Unless you count his mother’s credit cards, Hsu says.) And the quickly growing RTB boosted the number of mobile impressions its selling 110 percent from January to April this year.\nWhich brings up another key point about successful games:\n“Quick iteration is really important; you need to improve it after weeks, not months,” Hsu says. “On Android that could be as quick as days, while for iOS … we see updates every two to three weeks.”\nAI.

A key hook: Users get commissions from products they endorse for their friends.\n“We aren’t a fitness company,” CEO and founder Jeff Dyment told me. “We’re a tech company, focusing first on fitness” with a desktop and mobile social environment built on top of an affiliate platform . Once this model succeeds, he indicated, the company will launch similar social/buying communities for other interests.\nThere are three basic classes on Fitmoo — users, influencers, and brands.\nUsers follow other users or brands. They can chat with friends, join groups, post photos and messages on their social feed, track events in their area, create classes, and customize a fitness calendar.\nThey can also readily buy the fitness clothes and gear, gym memberships, classes, health drinks, and other products or services offered by brands they follow or endorsed by influencers — users who are celebrities or influential bloggers.\nOr they can become sellers themselves by endorsing products. In one click, an endorsed product goes into the user’s profile, returning an affiliate commission of five percent from any sales.\nAbove: A member’s page on Fitmoo\nImage Credit: Fitmoo\nThe New York City-based Fitmoo describes this kind of ecommerce as “social distribution,” where endorsements — from friends as well as from influencers — become a marketing engine.\nThe central idea, the company said, is to turn “followings into a business.”\nThe biggest influencers — a select group currently numbering about 15 — get special options and fees for pitching products to their large number of followers.\nThe site must approve a brand — which can be an event manager or a gym as well as a product seller — before it can participate. While there’s no charge to simply list products or services, the site takes a cut of sales.\nRob Orlando , an ex-professional CrossFit athlete who now manages a gym, is an example of a Fitmoo influencer who is also a brand. In the site’s announcement, he pointed out that few serious CrossFit athletes have enough sponsorships to make a living, but many have “highly engaged social communities.”\nVentureBeat is studying email marketing tools.\nChime in, and we’ll share the data with you .\nIn development for the past two years and in beta for the past five months, the platform currently has about 5,000 users and around 200 merchants. It is integrated with Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and Google+, allowing Fitmoo stores to serve friends and follower networks on those social channels.\nFitness sites and social ecommerce are crowded categories. Many other social communities have e-commerce capabilities , social interaction is increasingly common on marketplaces, and there are dozens of fitness-oriented online communities like Traineo and Wellsphere .\n“We’re positioning ourselves between shopping [sites] and the largest social networks,” outdoor sports buff Dyment told me. He compared Fitmoo to a fashion selling site like Poshmark , where users take photos of items they own and want to sell, and then socialize.\nBut, he said, the site offers a combination of activities — evangelizing, selling, buying, liking, posting, chatting — that adds up to a unique “social experience [where] commerce happens as a byproduct” of socializing.\nFitmoo also has its sights on expanding into a socializing that goes beyond workout groups or the chance to sell the latest protein drink to your friends.\nOn the drawing board: fitness-based dating.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nFitmoo\nFitmoo, Inc., was founded to organize, socialize and monetize the fitness industry.

Here’s a thumbnail sketch of each with my initial impressions (For a more thorough take on these startups from a real venture capitalist, read Christine Herron’s post ):\nCleverSet —Best of Show went to CleverSet, a Seattle-based company that takes a sophisticated statistical approach to product recommendations and personalization. This is not exactly an unknown company. It’s technology already powers 85 sites, including Sephora’s, Wine Enthusiast, and part of Overstock (I also wrote about them last summer in Business 2.0). CleverSet is applying some advanced math to improving recommendations, and claims to increase revenues for Websites that implement its technology by 18 to 30 percent, on average. If that’s true, they deserve to win. But then I ran into Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who is offering a $1 million prize to anyone who can improve his movie recommendations, and he expressed some skepticism about how useful any statistical approach can be. Hastings has found that even within just the category of movies, knowing what horror films someone likes tells you nothing about what dramas they might like. So making statistical correlations across products would be even more difficult.\nTripIt —A company that presented at TechCrunch40 , TripIt builds a personalized itinerary starting from your airline confirmation. A useful travel organizer. See Mike’s previous post .\nG.ho.st —All of our data and applications are moving online, why not the operating system? G.ho.st is a Web operating system of sorts that ties together all the data and applications you may be using across different Websites with one password and URL. Conceptually, I’m with them. But getting people to change their behavior and abandon everything on their desktops except for their browser is going to be tough. (G.ho.st was in the TechCrunch40 Demo Pit )\nSpiceWorks —Ad-supported enterprise software. Already 160,000 IT professionals use SpiceWorks to help manage their computer networks. SpiceWorks then serves up news feeds and product deals targeted at the specific devices on the networks they manage. It’s a consumer approach to enterprise software. This will work—until the ad bubble pops.\nClickForensics —The CEO claims that the click fraud rate is nearly 16 percent (and over 25 percent on distributed advertising networks like AdSense or Yahoo Publishers Network). ClickForensics offers a neutral service to both advertisers and publishers that audits the quality of the click traffic generated by any given ad campaign. This is a community approach to solving a growing problem, although some argue that the click fraud rate is already priced into what advertisers are willing to pay per click, so it is already being taken care of by the markets.\nRealius —Combine casual gaming and real estate porn and you get Realius. The fantasy real estate site, which will launch in beta in two weeks (and was also in the TechCrunch40 Demo Pit ), will take real listings and let people guess how much each house is worth (using a slider that shows where other people have voted). Revenues will supposedly come from advertising, referral fees, and service fees from brokers who can use the game for training purposes. The game is based on actual real estate data. The CEO lost me, though, when he said that you don’t find out if your guess was right until later when they send you an e-mail (which is designed to drive you back to the site). Any game that does not generate instant feedback on how you’ve done is dead in the water, IMHO. Check your e-mail to see if you’ve won! That’s going straight to the junk folder.\nOther startups that didn’t quite make the short list include Castfire, Kango , Footnote, Lemonade, Search-to-Phone , WooMe (another TC40 company), Sprigley, and GoXDML.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

To fix that problem, Blake Commagere, a pioneer of early social games such as Vampires , has created a way for game companies to easily insert product placements into the environment of their games, much the way that filmmakers do with strategically placed cans of Coca-Cola in movies or TV shows.\nCommagere’s Palo Alto, Calif.-based startup, MediaSpike , has created what it calls the “first premier product placement platform” for social and mobile games. Developers can easily adopt the platform and connect with the biggest brands who want to reach targeted audiences who usually ignore less-effective ads such as banners. At a time when social games are slowing down, the extra revenue could be meaningful. Adding just 75 cents in revenue per month per user could be a significant increase in revenue for a game.\nFor Zynga, selling virtual goods in free-to-play games is its main business model, generating more than 90 percent of its revenues. But that seems lopsided to Commagere, who has struggled for years to develop a scalable, automated system that enables companies to reap money from alternative business models such as product placement.\nCommagere says his latest startup was born from frustration. He found in his earlier efforts that he had to turn down advertisers who wanted to place product advertisements in his games. Even though they were cutting him checks of hundreds of thousands of dollars, it took too much time and effort to get the ads to properly show in the games. It was all reduced to hand-coding, a laborious process that distracted engineers from actually working on the games.\n“There were so many pain points that the industry settled upon virtual goods,” Commagere said, and that gave rise to companies like Zynga, which made lots of money selling virtual currency in its poker game.\nSo Commagere’s team of 10 employees set about creating a platform for scale, speed, and ease of use. Consider the image from a sample game below. On the wall is a spot for a generic glass of beer, and over the bartender’s head is an icon for a beer. An advertiser could use the specifications from MediaSpike to create an isometric view, two-dimensional ad for both of the locations. As you can see from the second picture below, it takes very little effort to insert a Red Bull ad into the generic slot.\nCommagere said that this kind of in-game advertising has been tried on the video game consoles by companies such as Massive (which Microsoft acquired), Double Fusion (whose former CEO Jonathan Epstein is an advisor to MediaSpike), and IGA Worldwide. But in-game ads in high-end games never reached their full potential. The process of incorporating ads into in-game locations was too difficult for teams that were designing games two or three years before the games were supposed to appear. That didn’t match up to the schedules of advertisers, who time campaigns in a matter of days or weeks.\nMediaSpike hopes it can do better. It is capturing analytics from the activity of players who venture near the product placements and see the ads, which can add a layer of authenticity to a game that is designed to resemble the real world. With a few clicks, a generic potion in a game could become a real energy drink. Advertisers could also insert real songs into a virtual jukebox machine or replace an animal in the game with a real-world mascot. In-game televisions could actually display real video ads. And developers might find they can charge more for branded virtual goods in their games.\nIt remains to be seen if Commagere can repeat some of the success he saw in the past. Back in the spring of 2007, Commagere was a 30-year-old veteran of viral marketing and a veteran of early social firm Plaxo, where he met the now-billionaire Sean Parker. Commagere saw that Facebook was about to open up its applications programming interface to third-party developers and he began experimenting with apps that could spread to as many users as possible. He created memorable apps such as Zombies and Vampires. Those apps were played by more than 50 million users, a huge number given Facebook’s relatively small audience at the time. He was also a member of the four-member team that created Causes on Facebook, an app which has raised more than $20 million for various charities.\nIn 2009, Commagere went on to become a cofounder and chief technology officer at Ohai, a social game company headed by former venture capitalist Susan Wu. They were creating a Flash-based massively multiplayer online game (a successor to the Vampires game), but the Flash platform couldn’t live up to the fast-action game that the developers wanted to create. Commagere left the company and Ohai eventually went belly up.\nAlong the way, he remembered how he created experimental in-game ads in his early titles and never got any complaints from users.\n“It held a lot of promise and the brands were thrilled,” he said. “People had strong brand identification, and they complained when the product placements ended. It was like wearing a Nike T-shirt to the mall in the real world.”\nHe founded MediaSpike in 2011 and raised an undisclosed amount of money from Raptor Capital, CMEA, 500 Startups, Venture51, EchoVC, and HNK Ventures. MediaSpike doesn’t have any direct competitors at the moment, though digital ad agencies may be trying to solve some of the same problems he has tackled. Ideally, those ad agencies that specialized in social media could become customers of MediaSpike.\nThe platform, visualized below, is designed to make it easier for an advertiser to pull the trigger on an in-game campaign. They can see the actual icon that will be used in the game and see how it looks inside the game by clicking on a link that takes them into the actual placement in the game. The interface is designed to take the time, pain and expense out of the process. Artists know exactly what kind of asset they need to create and they can check whether it’s going to be the right size or not. And the art in this kind of social or mobile game is a lot easier to create. The analytics can be used by advertisers and game developers alike to examine how effective the ads are. MediaSpike creates a sample rate card, though the actual advertising rates are subject to negotiation.\n“This really accelerates the process,” Commagere said. “The goal that we’re heading toward is self-service product placement.”\nAdvertisers can create targeting filters with the platform, such as targeting 100,000 men ages 13 to 34 in the U.S. market. The ad shows up only in the appropriate games where the player matches the target. MediaSpike is now in private beta testing and it has a waiting list of more than 100 developers. The aim is to make product placement into a huge revenue generator for game developers and open up new types of social and mobile games. The platform will work with games on iOS, Android, Facebook, and other platforms. So far, Commagere can’t talk about current advertisers or developers.\nHopefully, the task of creating product placement deals won’t be like picking up a bunch of pennies off the floor. But if Commagere has created the equivalent of a Hoover vacuum cleaner, then it won’t be a waste a time to collect all of those pennies.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nGB Latest News\n", "deleted" : false }

Always have been, always will be. We’ve measured efficiency up the wazoo of late, but we are less skilled at measuring effectiveness.\nFrancine Hardaway 05.22.13 6:00 AM\nIn the beginning, there was creative. Then came reach and frequency. Much later, programmatic buying.\nI've been having fascinating state-of-the-industry lunches over the past few months with Rodney Mayers, the CRO of Palo Alto-based Proximic . We've been trying to figure out how to tell the ad industry that although programmatic buying does bring efficiency to the process, it doesn't necessarily bring effectiveness. Efficiency is a work flow problem that can be solved by programmatic buying. But solving it will not necessarily move product unless it is combined with effectiveness—what makes people act.\nEffectiveness, the be-all and end-all of advertising, is a totally different story.\nIn the race to prove themselves up to the task of working with the CIO, CMOs have forgotten what Steve Jobs knew well: We are human and therefore emotional. We make decisions mostly on emotions. Where are our customers and what makes them buy? How do we query data to arrive at effective media buys? Effective advertising provokes decisions, but efficient advertising simply reaches people.\nWe should be measuring effectiveness—not efficiency.\nYou have to ask the right questions of the data produced by programmatic platforms in order to combine your increased efficiency with effectiveness. CMOs need to go back to the drawing board and spend time on how people actually make decisions. Because most decisions are made emotionally, the CMO actually may need less data. However, as data storage and cloud computing have drastically reduced the cost of storage, there is a contest to see who has Bigger Data, though most of it might be worthless.\nThis is especially true in brand marketing, where online advertising should work best. Tweaking the last little metrics to squeeze out some more 0.001 improvement might be okay for direct response marketers, but as online advertising matures, more and more agencies are becoming aware that branding initiatives work very well online, especially in cross-platform campaigns. Brand advertisers just need metrics to be in the right range, and then it’s more important to be able to scale the campaign—to reach the right people with the right messages. The question is \"did this ad move the revenue needle?\"\nWe should be measuring effectiveness—not efficiency. If we are efficient in getting the wrong message to the right people, what good does that do? In ad tech, we sometimes forget how important it is for the media buyer in an agency to actually get things done, and to execute easily in a way that can be communicated (and understood) by clients. The media buyer needs to be able to say \"I bought this because...\" and back up the decision with metrics that can be understood, not metrics that obfuscate.\nThese quotes from Ad Age's latest CMO study tell it well:\n\"A lot of them use metrics that don't measure finance at all. Some said, 'That's a good question.' Others said, 'If my boss is happy, that works for me.' Another: As one respondent colorfully put it, his company's marketing ROI measurement is like 'pissing in the wind.'\"\nThat's why to measure and reinforce effectiveness.\nHistorically, digital measured what it could and declared it a standard—first hits, then pageviews, then it was visitors, then unique visitors, then CTR, then CPA for early direct response deals in display, then CPC when search exploded, then viewability. It's now CPW (Cost Per Whatever). We've measured what we are able to measure, not what should be measured.\nEffectiveness and efficiency are the two sides of advertising; they always have been and always will be. We’ve measured efficiency up the wazoo lately, but we are less skilled at measuring effectiveness, because it means different things to different brands. We’re right back to the \"half of my ad dollars are wasted\" problem of John Wanamaker’s day.\nA measure of how efficient a buy is can be tracked with big data. Effectiveness is far more complex.\n[Image: Flickr user Martin Terber ]\nNewsletter\nGet the latest Leadership stories delivered to your inbox daily.\nSend\nI'd also like to receive special Fast Company offers\nMust Reads\n", "deleted" : false }

The software giant plans to integrate the VideoSurf technology into its Xbox Live platform, providing more granular data about what’s happening on-screen than traditional search technology.\nMicrosoft is aggressively adding new content sources to Xbox Live, bringing in video content from cable providers and TV networks such as Verizon, (s VZ) Comcast, (s CMCSA) HBO (s TWX) and Epix, among others. And it’s adding a universal search layer on top of those apps, enabling Xbox Live users to search for bits of content across multiple apps and choose between them. So a user searching for Harry Potter could be shown choices from Netflix, (s NFLX) Comcast’s video-on-demand library, HBO and Microsoft’s own Zune marketplace.\nAdvertisement\nToday, that search is being driven primarily by metadata given by the content provider. But technology from VideoSurf could provide more information to Xbox Live’s search capabilities. It does that through facial recognition and other techniques that will allow Xbox Live to identify actors and other key information within a scene.\nAdvertisement\nThat might not be as important when a user is searching for video from a TV or film content provider like Comcast or HBO, but it could come into play as Microsoft adds more independent video content. One of the newest partners for Microsoft’s Xbox Live platform will be YouTube, (s GOOG) which typically doesn’t have as much data associated with videos as premium content providers. That makes searching and navigating the billions of videos on YouTube a bit more difficult unless you have smart search technology to do so.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the primary plan is for VideoSurf to be embedded into Xbox Live, it could also give Microsoft hooks into other connected boxes. VideoSurf provides the backend search technology for the Boxee Box by D-Link , for instance. The acquisition could also help differentiate Microsoft’s broader search ambitions, by providing more info for its Bing video search engine.\nAdvertisement\nVideoSurf was founded in 2006 and has raised $28 million since then, from investors like former Vice President Al Gore, Current Media CEO Joel Hyatt, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, SurveyMonkey CEO David Goldberg and others.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

A lot of compelling and frank views were shared and discussed.\nI thought it would be interesting to repost some of the comments that some of you provided over the past year as they relate to SOA issues discussed.\nOn the relationship between SOA and Complex Event Processing , James Taylor said: \"I think one of the powerful effects of automating and managing operational decisions is that it helps link SOA, EDA/CEP and BPM. Decision-making logic must be shared effectively across these different approaches and that means that decisions must be identified and managed as first class objects.\"\nOn the relationship between SOA and business process management (BPM) , Chris commented on the challenge of achieving stateless and loosely coupled services: \"We have been looking for ever more flexible ways of creating components. We have been looking for as little coupling as possible between our components because that makes it easier to localize changes and reduce unwanted side effects. We have been looking to increase cohesion because keeping 'things' that belong together together gives us an easier way to manage the thing. We create deployment mechanisms that allow us to scale our components by adding new instances. We create deployment mechanisms that keep the functional behavior away from the operational details. But still we have trouble with the right level of abstraction to get value out of the components. That's partially because we have relative complexity in our businesses, we are encouraged to design for the 'pretty case,' i.e. the case where stuff doesn't break and we don't deal with timing and ambiguity well... So the  hope of having 'process stateless' services is a longshot. Nice to strive towards, but not easily achievable.\"\nOn SOA and economic conditions , Kirstan said: \"If the economy is turning down, then free and open source tools to help build and run an SOA make more and more sense. Open source tools like XAware for data services, ActiveEndpoints for orchestration, Mule or ServiceMix for ESB, are quite mature. Aside from saving money in a downturn, open source tools make even greater sense for 'project level SOA,' where a company can build an SOA in the small before committing to an expensive enterprise-level SOA.\nOn SOA even makes the US Marines nervous , Jabailo1 said: \"SOA is the only way to go. Unfortunately for large organizations which have grown fat and stupid on \"application servers\", outsourcing and management pay increase, it also takes finesse, intelligence, hard work and most of all -- that bugaboo word -- programming! Yeah, all those guys you laid off seven years ago? Those are the guys you want. All those guys you kept and made into \"technology managers\" and gave 14% per annum pay rises while they shipped the budget to Bangalore? Those are the guys you want to get rid of...\"\nOn the \"emergence\" of event-driven architecture (EDA) , Rob Eamon said: Analyst groups \"have been promoting the notion of the event-driven enterprise for over a decade. In my opinion, EDA and SOA are orthogonal notions. One doesn't subsume the other. A business or enterprise architecture is likely to adopt, or should adopt, principles from both approaches.\"\nOn reuse being a primary goal of SOA efforts , Eelcoh said: \"SOA should not be about reuse at all. If there is, and will be, only one consumer, there might be two different situations: 1 - The providing department is wrongfully made responsible for the process (that might happen). In this case, it does not make a lot of sense to have that department provide the service, but unless the right department is found, the alternatives aren't that good either. 2 - It just happens to be that there aren't that many consumers. In the second case, there should be no question about who should provide the service. The alternative would be that the consumer one way or another replicates the process. That is what SOA prevents. So one could say it is not about reuse, it helps to reduce. In the end, in my opinion, SOA is about isolating change, but I doubt whether the vendors understand that.\"\nOn ' how to tell it's not SOA ,' Tonymcs flipped the scenario with 'how to tell if it IS SOA: \"If it it doesn't work, it's SOA.... If its a 3 hour lecture with no information content, it's SOA...  If it's recommended by non-tech people, then it's SOA... If it's as useful as art criticism, it's SOA... If it's slow, it's SOA.... If it's spaghetti Javascript, then it's probably SOA..... If it's a bunch of services you'll never use, it's SOA.... If it's a category looking for a reason to exist, it's SOA.\"\nOn the evolution of computer science to \"service as a science,\" Storm14k said: \"Sometimes I laugh at these paragraphs that basically say nothing or restate common place scenarios with a lot of business buzzwords: 'Service systems are complex systems that dynamically configure access to resources (people, organizations, technology and information) to interact with other service systems and mutually create and capture value....'  Now ask one of these guys to build a concrete example of this and then the truth comes out. Its a load of crap and once they do figure it out they'll turn to the nearest guy with a CS degree to implement it anyway.\"\nOn selling SOA to the business , Jean-Jacques Dubray said: \"There is nothing ethereal about SOA. The very reason why most people think SOA is ethereal is precisely because most developers, architects, business analysts were never presented with a comprehensive view of SOA. Most people claimed they were doing SOA 20 or 30 years ago and that WS-* is not SOA. The reality is quite different, concepts such as bidirectional interfaces (WSDL), semantically accessible data structures (XML), orchestration (BPEL), forward compatible versioning (XML, XSD, WSDL)... are all brand new ideas that never existed before 1998 or so. SOA is only ethereal if you care to ignore these concepts.\"\nOn SOA as a strategy for times of economic turbulence , Robert Morschel said: \"Not convinced. The biggest problem that SOA is trying to solve is the total cost of ownership and the lack of agility caused by years of tack-on systems development. That's where the big money saving potential is, not making business processes more efficient. I agree SOA introduction needs to be iterative, but against the backdrop of an already persuaded business who are sick and tired of paying 60-80% of their IT budget just on maintenance costs not new development.\"\nOn whether SOA may be a faddish -- and even sloppy -- approach to management, Donald said: \"Those who say that SOA is just a fad or a buzzword do not really understand all the necessary concepts, governance, new application development and execution paradigm, and technologies needed to implement the simple concept of SOA. For a decade people had hoped that PKI [Public Key Infrastructure] would just go away because implementation is too complex for most people to want to understand. But today PKI is the only name in town for various identity purposes. SOA will not go away because it is the only name in town to shorten time to market and to save millions of dollars.\"\nOn whether SOA is more about integration or architecture , GGruber66 said: \"SOA=Integration is a very narrow view. And most people who are looking at it that way aren't just missing 1/2 the point of what SOA can do, they're also missing 1/2 the point on integration. SOA is not a panacea for integration. Passing data is easy, but if you're not moving to the business process aspects of 'what do I do with the data now that I have it' you've missed the boat. And SOA doesn't do that. Frankly if all you want is integration, just use a service like Boomi. SOA's real impact is felt when people expose services to others and allow people to create new capabilities and new products or services (I don't mean Web services). And when they take their eye off the fact that as you state SOA is an architecture, the services that they create probably won't meet the requirements for reliability and availability that businesses large and small demand. This is what happens when people fall in love with a buzzword and don't try to understand the business value that it's supposed to create. The SOA projects that fail most are the ones that start with SOA as the answer before anyone really thinks about what the question was.\"\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

The site’s results focus on specific episodes of web shows, notable individuals and more. Admittedly, I haven’t used the site much, but I have noticed that it takes great care in separating viral/user-generated videos from the production quality videos (e.g. things from College Humor, Hulu, etc.).\nIt’s likely that Microsoft purchased the company with the intent of strengthening video search in its Bing search engine.\nPreviously, VideoSurf raised $28 million from several notable investors, including former Vice President Al Gore, Current Media CEO Joel Hyatt, SurveyMonkey CEO David Goldberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg as well as funding from Pitango VC and Verizon Ventures.\nFounded in 2006, the San Mateo, California-based startup has 35 employees.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPress Releases\n", "deleted" : false }

According to the agency's latest annual report, ESTA answered 2.4 million calls last year, with almost 60 per cent coming from mobile phones.\nThe agency said it was imperative the federal communications department and Australia's mobile carriers worked together to improve the technology, known in the industry as Push MOLI (Mobile Origin Location Information).\n\"It's a federal challenge, and also the carriers have to invest money to progress MOLI to the point where we can pinpoint locate a caller,\" Ms Weiss said.\nESTA's annual report was one of dozens quietly tabled in Victorian Parliament in recent weeks. Other reports also revealed:\nA doubling of prisoner complaints to Victoria's health services commissioner.\nAbout 33,209 Victorians lodged Freedom of Information requests over the past year – the lowest number since 2009.\nThe remuneration rate for government ministers currently ranges between $130,000 to $199,999, according to figures cited by the department of premier and cabinet.\nAccording to ESTA's annual report, Triple Zero emergency calls have increased by 3 per cent since 2013-14. Asked what action it would take to improve ESTA's mobile location technology, a federal department of communications spokesman said a review had already taken place, which examined, among other things, \"how the Triple Zero service can take advantage of new technologies and respond to changing community expectations\".\n\"While the Triple Zero service is working well, the current arrangements for the national Triple Zero operator were established when voice calls from landlines dominated the telecommunications landscape. Technology and the way people communicate have changed significantly, offering opportunities to improve the existing voice arrangements, as well as potentially new ways for people to access assistance,\" the spokesman said.\n", "deleted" : false }

Namely, we were fighting for the Iron Belt — a finely crafted leather masterpiece that we promptly lost and replaced with a plastic dollar store wrestling belt with Iron Man crap glued to it.\nI’ll save my full impressions for a proper review in a couple days, but at a glance, at least, Marvel Battlegrounds seems like a blast of a game… but one that comes with some big built in costs.\nThe pacing of the game is fast, but not quite to the newcomer-crushing degree found in other brawlers like Super Smash Brothers. The learning curve is certainly a bit less steep than Smash… though, at the level we were playing at, we were mostly just mashing buttons. It reminds me a bit of Power Stone, a 1999 Dreamcast game that I really, really loved.\nAs you take and give damage, you build up a charged attack that does massive damage to everything around your character. These seem like they’re going to be key: in each match we played, knowing when to fire off (and how to avoid) these attacks are what swung the game toward the eventual winners.\nMy only hold-up, and it’s not a tiny one: like all games in this toys-to-life category (where physical, real world figurines are used to unlock the in-game characters), this one seems like it could get expensive fast.\nThere are around 25 characters to chose from at launch, one of which (Captain America) comes with the set. Each figurine costs $10-15 bucks, depending on where you buy it. If you want to have every character at your disposal (and with a multiplayer fighting game, you generally do. More characters = more variety = more fun.) that’s over $300 you’re shelling out on figurines. Add that on top of the $35+ you’ll pay for the required Disney Infinity starter set and the $20 you pay for the Marvel Battlegrounds playset to begin with, and… well … it gets a little crazy.\nStemming the craziness considerably is the concept of trial coins that you earn while just playing the game. Each trial coin can temporarily unlock any character on the roster until the next time the console is powered down, allowing you to give that character a spin — or to unlock a bunch of characters when your friends come over — without throwing down for the respective figures. Once the console turns off, though, they’re gone.\nMeanwhile, Disney will also temporarily unlock a rotating handful of characters for one week at a time. That way, even folks with just one statue and no trial coins to spare will have enough characters available for a four-player match.\nIt also helps that older Disney Infinity 2.0 Marvel figurines work with this set, some of which existing Infinity fans probably already own. But, on that same note, some of these older figurines can be tough to find, thus making it tough to fully flesh out your roster.\nAll in all, the game seems like a blast; but is the inevitably-expensive toys-to-life category a good fit for a fighting game? Disney is being more generous than they have to be here with the trial character/coin system… but the completionist in me is already tempted to throw down piles of money just to have the full experience.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

I was blown away by a demo over my dinky home Internet connection — the service is responsive, instant, and incredibly high quality (see showcase ).\nAdvertisement\nVusion said it requires broadband download speeds of 1.5 Mbps for 480p videos and 2.5 Mbps for 720p videos, making it fairly widely accessible. Akamai, by contrast, told us last year it expects only 10 to 20 percent of end users to have good enough connections to have a good experience watching its own HD offering.\nAdvertisement\nAs usual for these services (other competitors include GridNetworks and Digital Fountain ), end users will need to download a small piece of software to manage video delivery. On the plus side, Vusion does support Macs at launch.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe San Jose, Calif.-based company, formerly known as Jittr Networks, has been working on its technology for four years. So yes, it’s a bit slow to market, but then again this market is only exploding just now. VP Marketing Grover Righter would not detail the company’s specific improvements, saying it’s a combination of tweaks to existing solutions.\nAdvertisement\n“Video is an unnatural use case for the Internet,” was his hint. “The Internet doesn’t have a clock in it. It can’t tell you it’s second one, second two, with video here, here, and here. [Our solution is] not multistream with commodity servers, and three different ones coming to you. The Internet is actually overpopulated with data. You’re putting more video on the Internet than people can actually watch.”\nAdvertisement\nRighter contended Vusion’s technology is further along than Move, but admitted that Move is way ahead in terms of business development. Vusion is announcing today it has signed Island Def Jam Music Group as a customer; Move has a mess of television networks under its belt: ABC, FOX, ESPN, The CW.\nAdvertisement\nAlso, Vusion has raised an undisclosed amount of funding (we think it’s under $10 million), compared to the $68 million Move has hauled in. Vusion’s funding comes from BlueRun Ventures and “entertainment industry” investors, according to Righter.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

It has changed hands several times in the past few years, getting acquired by Viacom in 2006, then by Titan Gaming in 2010 . Xfire became independent again last fall.

Wired Blogs Security\nDate of Publication: 09.26.06.\nTime of Publication: 7:58 pm.\n7:58 pm\nReport: TrustE Sites Twice As Likely to Be Bad Actors\nBen\nEdelman, a researcher working on his Ph.D. in economics at Harvard, has posted a study showing that sites certified through Truste are twice as likely as similar, but uncertified sites to deliver spyware, adware and spam.\n \nEdelman compared nearly 1,000 Truste-certified sites to more than 500,000 sites as reported by a major ISP. Using MacAfee’s automated SiteAdvisor tool which visits site automatically, downloads software and subscribes using single-use email accounts, Edelman found (. pdf ) that 5.4% of Trust-E sites were untrustworthy, while only 2.5% of the baseline sites were.\nEdelman attributes these results to Truste’s reliance on customer complaints, its willingness to allow companies to violate their policies and then fix them later, its reluctance to strip certification and its economic incentive to keep sites as customers.\n \nIn comparison, Edelman found that sites in the Better Business Bureau OnLineøs Privacy Seal Program have substantially higher trustworthiness than the base level sites, which he attributes to the program’s stringent requirements.\n \n \nRegulators should hesitate to assume self-regulatory bodies will assess would-be members correctly; self-regulators’ incentives diverge substantially from a reasonable social utility function. Users should also be wary of supposed certifications; sophisticated users ought to question why sites proclaim their certification and what those certifications really mean. Finally, certification authorities might rightly reconsider their practices ø realizing that their credibility is on the line and that, in the long run, users will come to disbelieve certifications that are granted too easily.\nTruste has already responded in a blog entry :\n \n \nThe study does not present a full or accurate review of TRUSTe’s program requirements, monitoring processes and enforcement tools. The TRUSTe Web Seal Program Requirements represent a leading edge of privacy practices requiring disclosure of the uses of personal data, informed choice (as well as specifics for third-party sharing), and commitment to the Watchdog Dispute Resolution program. TRUSTe uses a number of tools, from user complaints to email seeding, to ensure continued compliance with our standards for informed notice and choice. Consumer generated Watchdog complaints have resulted in severe sanctions against licensees, including TRUSTe’s public termination of Gratis Internet – a company that the New York Attorney General has sued subsequent to TRUSTe’s actions.\nTruste’s mention of Gratis Internet is deliciously ironic spin, since its ‘investigation’ of the company behind the FreeIpods.com craze was instigated in part by an inquiry from Wired News.\n \n“The results of our investigation indicate that Gratis Internet did not violate their privacy policy,” Truste investigator Alexander Yap wrote in an October 2004 e-mail. “Truste did, however, work with them to strengthen and clarify their privacy statement.”\n \nGratis Internet is currently being sued by New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer for allegedly violating its privacy policy and renting/selling their 7.2 million customer database to three companies, which used the list to send upwards of 200 million spam messages.\n \nThat lawsuit also alleges that Gratis Internet employee Rani Nagpal told TRUSTe employee Heidi Berger on August 5, 2004, “I think there was some miscommunication about our email list: we just started renting it out to one company.” That was months before Truste could not find any violation of the company’s no-spam policy.\n \nTruste finally revoked the seal in January 2005, but never publicly said it pulled the certificate because Gratis was spamming its users. Gratis Internet said the certificate was pulled because Truste wanted it to pay thousands of dollars for compliance classes.\n \nEdelman did find one very interesting conclusion. The top natural search results (not paid results), especially from Yahoo, are very good indicators of sites’ reliability.\n", "deleted" : false }

The freebie required a registrant to sign up five others into the program, and eventually the legalized pyramid scheme reached its inevitable saturation point.\nWhile many did indeed get a free iPod, all ended up with inboxes full of marketing pitches, which began showing up within hours of registering.\nGratis lied to me for the story I wrote originally about the company (also linked above), which did wonders for their early credibility, and then lied again for a follow-up story I wrote about it’s privacy practices that was prompted by the avalanche of spam its customers mysteriously received.\nIn addition, Gratis Internet was a member of Truste , which provides a “privacy seal” to companies it says have a trusted privacy policy.\nWhen asked by Wired News in 2004 how third-party spammers got hold of Gratis members’ e-mail addresses, Truste said it could not find a problem with Gratis’ practices.\n“The results of our investigation indicate that Gratis Internet did not violate their privacy policy,” Truste investigator Alexander Yap wrote in an October 2004 e-mail. “Truste did, however, work with them to strengthen and clarify their privacy statement.”\nSeveral months later, Truste revoked Gratis’ seal of approval, then quickly reinstated it, then pulled it again, but declined to state publicly its reasons.\nIn the wake of this week’s settlement, Truste’s spokeswoman did not return repeated phone calls, and executive director Fran Maier did not respond to e-mailed questions about why Truste never discovered the alleged sale or informed the public that Gratis was not adhering to its privacy policy.\nPosted in: UncategorizedTagged: iPod\nAbout the author:\nLeander Kahney is the editor and publisher of Cult of Mac.

In those situations, you can use the command in this how-to without even having to restart your Mac.\nWith almost every iteration of OS X, the command has changed to flush the DNS cache. In this article, we'll show you how to clear the DNS cache in OS X Yosemite (10.10). The old \"mDNSResponder\" command no longer works since Yosemite has a new system that manages the DNS cache.\nReset MDNS Cache (Multicast DNS)\nOS X utilizes two DNS cache systems; the first is a MDNS Cache (or Multicast DNS) that handles the zero configuration services on your local network. To reset the MDNS cache, open the Terminal (located in Aplications/Utilities) and type the following command, followed by the return key:\nsudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache\nIf you are prompted for a password, simply enter it, then press return again.\nReset UDNS Cache (Unicast DNS)\nThe second DNS cache is called UDNS (or Unicast DNS), which handles associations between the network addresses and the network endpoints. To reset this cache, open the Terminal, then enter the following command:\nsudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches\nAgain, you may be prompted for a password. If so, enter it, then press return.\nReset Both Caches at Once\nIf you wish to reset all DNS caches in OS X Yosemite at once, then simply join the commands together with a semicolon, then paste them into Terminal like this:\nsudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache; sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches\nAfter you've typed the command on a single line, all you have to do is press enter to flush both cache systems in OS X.\nRELATED ARTICLES\n", "deleted" : false }

That's a lot smaller than Club Penguin, which Disney acquired for $350 million last year.\nIdeal Bite is small even as far as e-mail lists go--it's no DailyCandy --but its demographic was likely of interest to a buyer like Disney. The site's median household income is $82,000, press materials state; the median age is 35; and the target demographic is the sort that \"drinks organic wine after yoga.\" In other words, yuppie moms.\nAnd \"green\" media is unsurprisingly a hot niche. Last year, Discovery Communications acquired the blog TreeHugger to accompany its Planet Green cable network, and the TreeHugger-Discovery partnership was recently selected to power the new eco-news division at the Huffington Post .\nWhen we last heard from Ideal Bite, it was throwing a chic launch party in New York last year following an investment by the Pilot Group, the firm headed by MTV co-founder and former AOL exec Bob Pittman. The celebration featured a mechanical bull and dancers clad entirely in leaves, which I expect won't be featured in any kind of Disney-bought-us gala.\nThen again, Disney is responsible for Desperate Housewives.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

In June, Intuit laid off 399 employees as part of a company realignment . Last week as part of its quarterly earnings, the company said that it would divest several business units, including Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken.\nAccompanying layoffs are not uncommon as companies re-orient their strategies to focus on more successful products. Still, Intuit has had a tough run in recent weeks. Following its earnings report last week, the company’s stock fell sharply. Intuit also increased its cash dividend by 20 percent.\n“In 2013, we kicked off a multi-year change journey designed to sharpen Intuit’s focus on and investment in businesses that strengthen the Intuit ecosystem and align with two strategic goals: to be the operating system behind small business success, and to do the nations’ taxes in the U.S. and Canada. Today we communicated organizational changes that continue to drive our transformation,” a spokesperson for Intuit said.\n“Unfortunately, this included some reductions to our staff to ensure we’re structured appropriately and aligned with our priorities. We have great confidence in our strategy, our execution, and our trajectory as we build this company for the long term. These are tough choices, but we believe these are the right moves for a company that’s built to last and focused on the future.”\nRelated Articles\nIntuit Lays Off 399 Employees In Company Realignment Uber Partners With Intuit To Help Drivers Track Earnings Stripe Partners With Intuit To Help On-Demand Workers Keep Track Of Their Finances Intuit Buys ZeroPaper, Its First Acquisition In Brazil\nIntuit is known for its tax preparation services like TurboTax and financial services like QuickBooks. In January, the  company partnered with Uber   and Stripe  to help those on-demand workers keep track of their finances. But it’s clear that the company is still trying to figure out what it looks like in 2015 as it focuses down on a smaller set of business tools.\nPrior to the company’s earnings report, its stock has risen more than 28 percent on the year, making the company worth more than $28 billion based on its market cap. It’s now worth about $22 billion since that last earnings report. On the year, shares of Intuit are down around 3 percent, giving up the gains it produced leading up to its earnings report.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

His focus will be cybersecurity, he said in an interview with CNET on Tuesday.\nOne of his main goals will be to fund researchers at hacker spaces, start-ups, and boutiques who are most likely to develop technologies that can leapfrog what comes out of large corporations. \"I want revolutionary changes. I don't want evolutionary ones,\" he said.\nHe's also hoping that giving a big push to research and development will do more to advance the progress of cybersecurity than public policy decisions have been able to do over the past few decades.\n\"Not much has changed\" with regard to strengthening the U.S. cybersecurity position, he said. \"As a society, we have a larger dependence on being wired in, yet the government only focuses on particular areas.\"\nThe connectedness of commercial, government, and military networks makes the situation even more dire, he said. \"I'm going to argue that they're all pretty much intertwined now and we've seen how vulnerable some of those sectors are now. That's unacceptable,\" Zatko said. \"I aim to fix that.\"\nThe current state of technology isn't working adequately, for the government or commercial companies, he said. For instance, the current defense mechanisms need to change so they can block attacks, instead of responding to them, he added.\n\"I don't want people to be putting out virus signatures after a virus has come out,\" he said. \"I want an active defense. I want to be at the sharp pointy end of the stick.\"\nZatko cut his security chops as a teen-age hacker in the 1980s and managed to stay one step ahead of the law. He ran the L0pht hacker space during the 1990s, where he invented anti-sniffing technology that became the first remote promiscuous system detector used by the Defense Department. He also pioneered work on buffer overflows, which are a basis for many computer network attacks.\n\"L0pht turned the industry on its head,\" he said. \"You didn't have security response teams at major organizations like Microsoft or Intel until we came along.\"\nHe started the corporate information security group at BBN Technologies in the 1990s, was chief executive at L0pht Heavy Industries when the hacker space decided to incorporate, and founded security consultancy @Stake, which was later acquired by Symantec. Since 2004, he's been back at BBN, working as division scientist and technical director for the company's National Intelligence Research and Applications department.\nZatko has also done his fair share of work for the government. He was appointed to the Information Assurance sub-committee out of the Executive Office of the President, named as a subcommittee member to the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Protection and testified several times before Congressional committees. The main hacker character in the book Breakpoint by former U.S. cybersecurity guru Richard Clarke is believed to be based on him.\n\"I don't want people to be putting out virus signatures after a virus has come out. I want an active defense. I want to be at the sharp pointy end of the stick.\"\n--Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, newly hired program manager at DARPA\nHe's not the only self-described hacker to embrace public service. Jeff Moss, founder of the Black Hat and Defcon conferences, joined the Homeland Security Advisory Council last summer .\nOne of the reasons Zatko decided to take the job is that the new DARPA director, Regina Dugan, is entrepreneurial and is looking to engage more with academics, following years of DARPA being closed to nongovernmental researchers for national security reasons, he said. \"Now they are running more programs out of DARPA that are not classified beyond what they need to be, so it will enable more people to have visibility into them,\" he added.\nAnother lure of the job was the budget he will have. Zatko said he doesn't know exactly how much of the $3.5 billion a year DARPA spends to fund research he will oversee but said it's likely to be a \"good chunk.\"\nFrom his many years doing penetration testing and working to break security systems, he understands what it takes to try to defend networks and how to come up with innovative solutions to break through barriers and get around obstructions.\n\"I've got a track record of doing novel things on both the offense and defense side,\" he said. \"In the commercial world I wasn't able to take those to fruition because often the market drivers and the money drivers were at odds. You don't want to put yourself out of business. But now, I want to put myself out of business.\"\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

That's a 30 per cent jump on last year, before you even count Foxtel Play streaming viewers, but not everyone wanting to learn the fate of Jon Snow decided to do the right thing.\nDon't Play\nTrailer 2: Game of Thrones season 6\nThe second trailer for Game of Thrones season 6 hints at all the big conflicts to come.\nPlenty of locals also turned to the BitTorrent channel, with Australia accounting for 12.5 per cent of all Game of Thrones BitTorrent traffic in the first 12 hours, according to piracy news site TorrentFreak . The numbers are skewed due to time zone differences, but they support claims that per capita we're some of the world's most prolific pirates.\nOf course BitTorrent is only the tip of the piracy iceberg, as illustrated by the fact that Australia's copyright police are calling for the blocking of piracy streaming site SolarMovie . There are plenty of other ways to watch Game of Thrones without paying, from alternative file sharing platforms to streaming plugins for media player software like Kodi, but it seems plenty of pirates have stuck with BitTorrent.\nBack from the dead: In one of the most anticipated television comebacks since Elvis in 1968, Jon Snow has been resurrected by Red Woman's (Carice Van Houten) black magic. \nPhoto: HBO/Foxtel\nIt's true that the early Game of Thrones BitTorrent piracy numbers are slightly down on last season, but what's really surprising is that so many downloads were traced back to Australia despite the country's high-profile piracy crackdown.\nOf course the so-called crackdown achieved very little; the Dallas Buyers Club case was thrown out, the three-strikes warning scheme is in tatters and efforts to block piracy websites are yet to come into effect. But you'd still think that pirates who haven't been scared straight would step up their security precautions such as masking their activities behind a VPN or SOCKS5 proxy – making them appear to be in a different country so they wouldn't contribute to Australia's piracy statistics.\nAdvertisement\nAfter everything that's happened in the last few years you'd expect Australia's piracy rates to plunge, at least at face value, with a corresponding spike in downloads from the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain. Perhaps Aussie pirates are all hiding behind Australian VPN servers, but it seems that plenty of local BitTorrent users either don't read the news or have no faith in the authorities' ability to chase them down.\nDon't make the mistake of thinking the failed Dallas Buyers Club case gives Aussie pirates a Get out of Jail Free card. Justice Perram was ready to hand over the details of people allegedly caught downloading the movie, the case only fell over because the judge didn't trust the movie's backers not to extort people with speculative invoicing. Another case could succeed if the copyright owners agree to play by the judge's rules.\nAll the time, money and political will poured into the piracy crackdown has clearly achieved very little when Australian pirates don't even feel the need to hide in the shadows. A rethink of the way we approach piracy is in order but don't hold your breath – it's easier for the government and powerful copyright lobby to stay the course than actually address the underlying reasons why Australians feel ripped off.\nHow did you watch Game of Thrones this week? What would it take to win more people away from piracy?\n", "deleted" : false }

For Sale?\nby Ingrid Lunden\n0 Comments\nPaidContent has learned that Dun & Bradstreet (NYSE: DNB), the business information company, has put AllBusiness.com, the information and news site for small businesses, under review. D&B bought the website for $55 million back in 2007 .\nTwo separate sources close to the situation told paidContent that Greg Stern, VP at AllBusiness, yesterday sent an email out to its freelancers, telling them that it was “evaluating its strategic options” for AllBusiness.com. It further said it would “no longer be accepting blog postings and other editorial contributions” and that any contracts they had with the company were terminated. They were also requested to file invoices as soon as possible for work that had been commissioned. The full text of the email is below.\nAdvertisement\nBoth sources also said that editorial staff were getting laid off. Their last day will be this Friday.\nAdvertisement\nWe have reached out to a spokesperson from D&B to confirm all of this and to get more detail on what those “strategic options” might be. We will update the story as we learn more.\nAdvertisement\nUpdate: No response yet from D&B, but Peter Horan, once CEO of AllBusiness.com before it was sold to D&B, tweeted that Allbusiness was in an active sale process. “Non media companies like the idea of media more than they like media business,” he also wrote. “[Allbusiness] has great team and great tech.” Also: two other possible traffic figures from the site, from Quantcast (505,000); and a commenter on this post, who cites Google (NSDQ: GOOG) Display Network’s recent numbers as 1.3 million uniques.\nAdvertisement\nUpdate 2: A D&B spokesperson has confirmed that the company is evaluating strategic options for AllBusiness.com, without elaborating further. [original article continues below]\nAdvertisement\nIn terms of the traffic on AllBusiness.com, the numbers one finds online vary greatly: a note from the company’s regional sales manager in Texas on LinkedIn notes that the company has “3 million+” monthly unique visitors; Compete says monthly visitors are close to 581,000 in November 2011, and dropping. Links on AllBusiness.com’s “about” page to advertise on the site go directly to the homepage for D&B.\nAdvertisement\nNor is it clear how well AllBusiness is doing financially. D&B noted in its last quarterly results (Q3 2011) that its Internet Solutions division — which includes AllBusiness, the financial information site Hoovers and the web portal for DNB.com’s portfolio of services — grew revenues by eight percent over the same quarter a year ago, to $31.5 million. Total company revenues were $439.4 million, meaning that Internet Solutions represented only about seven percent of overall sales.\nAdvertisement\nAllBusiness has had a rollercoaster of a ride in the world of online media: started in 1999, the site got bought by NBC (NSDQ: CMCSA) Internet for an eye-watering $225 million in 2000, before then getting taken private. It was eventually sold to D&B for $55 million in 2007.\nAdvertisement\nAlways a promising idea — news focussed on the small-business world — that perhaps proved challenging in long-term business execution, ultimately ending up with a company for which AllBusiness’ main currency, content, was not core enough.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThank you for being a valued contributor to AllBusiness.com.\nI am writing to let you know that D&B is evaluating its strategic options for AllBusiness.com. During that process, we will not be accepting blog postings and other editorial contributions.\nTherefore, we are asking you to please cease work on AllBusiness.com projects and submit an invoice for all outstanding payments as soon as possible. Specific assignments already in progress do not need to be completed, but should be included in the invoice.\nPlease note that this letter will serve as notice that your contract with D&B is being terminated.\nThank you again. We have a tremendous appreciation of all your contributions and support in helping to make AllBusiness.com the Web’s premier small business resource.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

It was originally an extension, but Mozilla baked the features of the Personas extension directly into version 3.6 of the browser. Neat, except that updates to the personas feature were then tied irrevocably to browser updates. And Mozilla has a few restrictions on how personas operate — like, you can only have 8 of them at a time, and you can only get them from the personas showcase . Brand Thunder has just released their own extension called Personas Interactive that leapfrogs Mozilla’s offering.\nThe benefits of Personas Interactive may not be immediately apparent to you, as they weren’t to me. I asked Brand Thunder to articulate the goods for me:\nFor Users\nFirefox locked users into only eight Personas, whereas users of themes often like to sample and change their themes. I suspect when you have something this visually present, there’s a degree of fatigue that occurs and users like to see something else after a while.\nSome Personas themes don’t work well with bookmark toolbars and other links because of the forced text shadows which can make the text very hard to read. We’d made text shadows an option so users can use the best method for their chosen theme.\nUsers who love themes often have one installed, but they had to be in Default mode in order to use Personas. We’ve removed that restriction and Personas will now work with any Firefox theme.\nMac users can also prevent the titlebar from changing color, which was another default setting in Personas.\nFor Developers\nWe give any site the ability to preview and install Personas. The only place to get a Persona was from the Personas Gallery. Designers had to submit their designs and users could only preview and install on the Personas Gallery site. We’ve removed that restriction. A developer/designer can now host and manage their own Personas Gallery giving them better control over managing and maintaining their community.\nWeb sites can offer site specific Personas allowing the browser theme to change when a user is visiting that web site, but goes away when they leave the site.\nDesigners have the full use of CSS3 backgrounds capabilities in Personas including multiple images, repeating, sizing, positioning and more. This provides much more design freedom and ensures design integrity even in very wide browser resolutions. Personas are typically a fixed size and you can exceed the theme if you have a wide monitor.\nThe designer has the ability to turn off text shadows in individual Personas. This is another way to ensure design integrity.\nAnother designer tweak is specifying a background color without affecting the titlebar on Mac.\nThere’s some more details on Mike Kaply’s blog .\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

Following the old adage that time is money, startup founders must recognize the importance of increasing productivity in a fast-paced and oftentimes distracting work environment.\nTen entrepreneurs from Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) share the rules they’ve implemented in their companies to ensure that simple distractions don’t turn into major delays (or worse).\n1. Don’t communicate via instant message.\nInstant messages, like G-chat, can be a huge drain on productivity because they take team members off task. Instead of IMs, our team uses Slack for all internal communication. Slack groups conversations across different channels by project/topic. Because the desktop app runs all the time, employees can check the app at pre-set intervals without being interrupted by disparate messages.-- Brittany Hodak , ZinePak\n2. Utilize open documents with communal authorship.\nAll documents created in our domain are made both public and editable by default. It’s easy for people to find, disseminate and update information. There are also no hassles with sharing, partisanship or silos of information. Furthermore, documents do not have a stated author: we choose to emphasize collaboration and working toward the best solution rather than defending individual positions or reputations.-- AJ Shankar , Everlaw\n3. Always have a meeting objective.\nWe start every meeting with the same question: \"What is the objective of this meeting?\" The person who calls the meeting is responsible for clearly stating the objective as well as making sure that the target objective is reached before the meeting ends. Having this objective in mind helps everyone stay on track and focused while working together in the most efficient manner.-- Andrew Kucheriavy , Intechnic\n4. Call first.\nWhile picking up the phone and calling someone seems dated nowadays, our team certainly does it. During standard business hours, if the question is timely, we ask folks to communicate over the phone. You avoid the delay of email and can usually get to the heart of the matter much more quickly. Plus, it’s less easy for sentiments to get lost in translation.-- Sam Davidson , Batch\n5. Share feedback on everything.\nYou’ll often hear employees refer to the resources that they need to do a better job. I always ask my team to share their feedback and encourage them to have a logical discussion of why they may need a tool or service to do a better job. This has led to some incredible new additions in technology, apps and even hiring.-- Nicole Munoz , Start Ranking Now\n6. Do it now (if it takes less than 2 minutes).\nAvoid the dreaded “I’ll get back to you” statement and similarly the flagging of email messages that only require you re-reading the message to understand what needs to be done. If can you can write a response in less than two minutes, which is common for most emails, then take action immediately. Why have an unresolved issue swirling around in your memory? Do it now, knock it off your mental list and move on!-- David Ciccarelli , Voices.com\n7. Work in four-hour time blocks.\nOur remote team can choose to work whenever and wherever they like, but we find that asking them to work in time blocks of four hours equals greater productivity. When you work remotely, it’s tempting to work for 20 minutes here and there, but that’s not really enough time to get into the flow. Working in longer chunks and only taking short breaks for basic necessities gets more done faster.-- Dave Nevogt , Hubstaff.com\n8. Hold morning Scrum meetings.\nEvery day, our teams have Scrum meetings. These meetings are a dynamic, holistic approach to product development where teams come together to reach a common goal. Regular Scrums keep employees accountable to tasks and help them to be more productive.-- Mike Seiman , CPXi\n9. Structure meetings strategically.\nMany firms make the mistake of holding inefficient, hours-long meetings that accomplish very little. What they fail to realize is that this is an enormous waste of money (since you are paying each employee to essentially do nothing), and that meetings can actually be incredibly productive if done correctly. To avoid inefficiency at LexION Capital, I implement strict roles for meetings.-- Elle Kaplan , LexION Capital\n10. Have an open communication policy.\nWe encourage our entire team to voice their opinions, challenges, concerns and thoughts as freely as possible on a daily basis. If they need to chat with someone briefly, we want them to talk face-to-face and solve the problem at hand. They should not feel worried about speaking to our CEO openly to get work done, which has made project completion much faster and much more of a group effort.-- Miles Jennings , Recruiter.com\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.\nPublished on: Jul 27, 2015\nMORE:\n", "deleted" : false }

These represent diluted shares and not shares that     have been issued.\nBusiness Highlights\nVerisign Registry Services added 2.65 million net new names during the     first quarter, ending with 142.5 million .com and .net domain names in     the domain name base, which represents a 7.1 percent increase over the     base at the end of the first quarter in 2015.\nIn the first quarter, Verisign processed 10.0 million new domain name     registrations for .com and .net, as compared to 8.7 million for the     same quarter in 2015.\nThe final .com and .net renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2015     was 73.3 percent compared with 72.5 percent for the same quarter in     2014. Renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the     end of the quarter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA\nVerisign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are    prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles    (GAAP). Along with this information, management typically discloses and    discusses certain non-GAAP financial information in quarterly earnings    releases, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences    and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include    the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP:    stock-based compensation, unrealized gain/loss on the contingent    interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures, and    non-cash interest expense. Non-GAAP net income is decreased by amounts    accrued, if any, during the period for contingent interest payable    resulting from upside or downside triggers related to the subordinated    convertible debentures and is adjusted for an income tax rate of 26    percent which differs from the GAAP income tax rate.\nOn a quarterly basis, Verisign also provides Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted    EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in accordance    with the terms of the indentures governing Verisign’s 4.625% senior    notes due 2023 and 5.25% senior notes due 2025. Adjusted EBITDA refers    to net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,    stock-based compensation, unrealized loss (gain) on the contingent    interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures and    unrealized (gain) loss on hedging agreements.\nManagement believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements the    GAAP financial data by providing investors with additional information    that allows them to have a clearer picture of Verisign’s operations. The    presentation of this additional information is not meant to be    considered in isolation nor as a substitute for results prepared in    accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the non-GAAP information    enhances investors’ overall understanding of Verisign’s financial    performance and the comparability of Verisign’s operating results from    period to period.\nThe tables appended to this release include a reconciliation of the    non-GAAP financial information to the comparable financial information    reported in accordance with GAAP for the given periods.\nToday’s Conference Call\nVerisign will host a live conference call today at 4:30 p.m. (EDT) to    review the first quarter 2016 results. The call will be accessible by    direct dial at (888) 676-VRSN (U.S.) or (913) 312-1449 (international),    conference ID: Verisign.

CallOrange, a promoter of locksmith services in the Metro Phoenix area, recently tested their ability to expand into a new market by offering service in Tucson, the second most populous city in Arizona located approximately 100 miles south of their dispatch center in Tempe, Arizona.\nCallOrange has stated that the expansion of service into Tucson was an extremely smooth process with much better than anticipated results due to their new technician tracking system. “Our new real-time GPS tech locator system has quickly become an invaluable tool for providing excellent service.” says Yuvi Shmul, founder of Call Orange. “This tool has enabled us to provide faster services for our customers, increased routing efficiency for our dispatchers which, in turn, has allowed our locksmith technicians to be more profitable by completing more jobs with less travel.”\nIn an industry where quick service to a customer is imperative for success, being able to send the closest technician with the right tools and qualifications to perform the job is crucial. The new “TechTracker”\napplication that CallOrange has developed is a GPS map system that enables customers and CallOrange dispatchers to see on a map where all available locksmith technician are located at any time, day or night. Having this information means that a dispatcher can quickly locate and send the closest available technician to the customer’s location.\n“One of the biggest hurdles when expanding service into a new city is being able to efficiently route the technicians.”\nsays Yuvi. “Our testing of this new map locator system during the expansion into Tucson has eliminated this hurdle. We can now confidently expand service beyond Arizona into surrounding states. We have the jobs, now we just need the technicians to do the work.”\nCallOrange is now actively seeking new locksmith technicians in all major cities throughout Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado. Any interested locksmith technicians in Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Colorado Springs, and Denver, or any highly motivated individual who is looking for a new career with high income potential, is encouraged to contact CallOrange for more information.\nFor more information visit: http://callorange.com/\nopportunity/\nAbout CallOrange.com and 24/7 Pro Locksmith, LLC\nCallOrange.com LLC is a promotion company of locksmith, alarms, and home automation services, based in Metro Phoenix, Arizona.

Together, the combined network will enable advertisers to reach over 75 million digital radio listeners via more than 80 digital radio broadcasters in the U.S. and Europe.\n \nThe merger will combine TargetSpot’s ad network with the Radionomy audio publishing platform, which enables users to create their own online radio stations, thus offering advertisers greater scale for digital radio campaigns, as well as offering new technologies and products to broadcasters and advertisers.\nProducts and tools offered by the merging companies include sequential targeting, behavioral marketing, audio ad retargeting and asynchronous banner ads, as well as a variety of customizable ad products.\n \nFounded in Belgium in 2008, Radionomy offers music enthusiasts free, unlimited storage for music programming as well as a digital broadcast platform via its Web-based interface, app and social media players. Radionomy splits ad revenue with station programmers that achieve a certain number of listeners. It also provides a library of free music and news content to help bolster programming.\n \nAs noted, digital radio news has been coming fast and furious in recent months. Last week, Cumulus began promoting its partnership with digital audio platform Rdio with a nationwide campaign on Cumulus stations, coinciding with the launch of new Cumulus station-branded product pages on Rdio. Cumulus took a stake in Rdio’s parent company, Pulser Media, in September, in exchange for exclusive content, media and on-air promotional commitments over a five-year period.\n \nAlso, Apple’s iTunes Radio, launched in September, is muscling up its ad sales capabilities with new hires, including Michael Pallad, formerly an executive vice president of sales at Cumulus, who was brought on last week to help lead sales at the new service. Separately, Spotify is responding to the Apple challenge with a free, ad-supported mobile music service of its own. Digital radio pioneer Pandora is also upgrading its service with new features like an alarm clock function in order to fend off the threat from Apple and Spotify.\n15\n", "deleted" : false }

The service currently supports only AIM but Kalsey says that will change soon. Free accounts are limited, but premium subscribers can monitor an unlimited number of feeds, remove ads in the alerts, use a web interface to manage their alerts. Unlike other similar services FeedCrier also delivers item summaries and alerts received when users were offline. Premium accounts are $4 per month. There are other services available that are better for this in some ways, but there’s plenty of room for competition.\nI think this is an important class of web tools, for consumers seeking to jump on sales quickly and professionals doing time sensitive work. Competitors include Peter Brown’s immedi.at (interviewed here ), Eduard Sherstnev’s Zaptxt (watch this company in coming weeks) and the most sophisticated of them all, Rasasa , from the Netherlands. These other services are not limited to AIM, they offer autodiscovery bookmarklets and both Zaptxt and Rasasa incorporate SMS and email alerts as well. Rasasa’s push technology is the smartest, but isn’t supported by all US mobile vendors.\nI’ve long thought that FeedBurner should team with one of these companies and sure enough, it was FeedBurner VP of business development Rick Klau’s blog where I learned about FeedCrier. Klau has a FeedFlare widget that publishers can use to provide a link to FeedCrier alerts for their feeds. The same could be done for other services with relative ease via the FeedFlare API. I think that increasingly powerful RSS to IM tools will be in demand as RSS use continues to grow – particularly in business.\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

It's a tall order, given that there are something like 10,000 career sites on the Net. But FlipDog.com differs from the big job sites in one important way: It doesn't wait for employers to list openings on its site. Instead, it prowls the Web, collects job postings directly from employers, and puts them in one central location. As I'm writing this piece, FlipDog has 554,023 listings from 46,575 different companies.\nOf course, you still have to find the job that's right for you. You can visit the site; choose a location, a job category, a function, or a company; and then get a list of the openings that meet your criteria. A better approach, though, is to use the \"JobHunters\" feature. You can use it to indicate specific job criteria and receive email notices when a job that meets your requirements is added to the database.\nYou can also specify whether your level of interest in finding a new job is active, passive, or private. If you're actively looking for a job, prospective employers can view your résumé. If you're passively looking, your information will only be available to employers to whom you've submitted applications. If you choose to keep your job-search status private, then your personal information will be blocked from potential employers.\nMy one bone to pick: The site has some obvious gaps. For example, while setting up my JobHunter, I couldn't list Microsoft as a company to watch because it wasn't part of FlipDog's directory.

To that end, the company bought Jibe Mobile, a provider of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Last fall, Google committed to the RCS carrier standard for support of mobile messaging, including group chats, high resolution photos and more.\nRCS has been around for a long time — since 2007 — but so far hasn't won the support of more than 50 wireless carriers globally. In February, Google and 15 global carriers partnered with the GSM Association to promote further RCS adoption. \nWith Jibe, Google is building a dedicated RCS client to run on Android devices. It isn't clear when the client will be launched, although some reports have speculated more details could be revealed in May at Google's I/O conference.\nGoogle's plan is for the RCS messaging app to be part of a new Android phone from the time a customer leaves the store, according to a Google official who asked not to be named. It will be available in older phones through Google Play and will be compatible with SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service, the official said Wednesday.\nGoogle's RCS client would reportedly bring features that are seen in third-party services like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Hangouts and more. Some of the technology is discussed in an online primer from Jibe  and one of the possible features is real-time typing. In addition, a user wouldn't have to find and sign up for separate accounts for different services, thereby reducing the fragmentation that has irked some Android customers.\nIn the February announcement describing the partnership with the GSMA, Sprint was the only U.S. wireless carrier listed as wanting to accelerate the availability of RCS. Last July, T-Mobile also announced  support for RCS with Advanced Messaging.\nAT&T and Verizon are reportedly interested in RCS, but haven't announced any specific plans. Google is talking to various carriers about joining RCS but isn't ready to name more, Google said.\nThe advantages of RCS to users would be convenience and more features than they can find by using SMS, which is still widely in use. Wireless carriers, meanwhile, could use the standard to compete against individual third-party messaging apps, often referred to as Over-The-Top (OTT) apps.\n\"Google got on board with RCS and Jibe because they were losing to OTT and were losing with Hangouts anyway, so RCS is another way to take another shot at the messaging space,\" said Steve French, global vice president of product management at OpenMarket , a mobile messaging provider to enterprises.\nSince Android is estimated to run on 80% of the world's wireless phones, having a common messaging app could help Google gain a stronghold in the mobile messaging market, French said.\nGoogle’s RCS app won't replace the Hangouts app, according to the Google source. The RCS app will be separate from both Hangouts and Google Plus.\nA report that circulated in December and was first posted by Phandroid , said that Hangouts would lose its SMS and MMS functionality. But Google wouldn't confirm the report.\nJR Raphael, author of Computerworld's Android Power blog, described himself as a heavy user of Hangouts for messaging with other people. Hangouts is \"useful, especially as a subscriber to Google's Project Fi service, which allows you to use Hangouts to access all messages, including SMS, from any device or platform,\" he said. \"But I've also grown frustrated with Google's divided attention to the messaging domain and the often-slow progress on Hangouts that results from it ... I wish Google would settle on a single messaging client already.\"\nThe Jibe acquisition and RCS are Google's attempts \"to reduce Apple's advantage with iMessage,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \"The Android RCS app could conceivably run on every phone, providing high quality messaging between all Android and iOS phones.\"\nWhether Apple would ever accept RCS in a common platform with Android is questionable, however. And given that the GSM universe has about 800 carriers, Google has a big job ahead of it to achieve adoption, French and others said.\n\"RCS has taken forever to take hold,\" added Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at Technalysis Research. \"Google realizes they have fragmentation at numerous levels with Android and a core service like messaging is where they need to do more. RCS would bring a universal way to do services like Snapchat and Whatsapp. So, moving to RCS does make sense, but you wonder why it has taken so long.\"\nWhile Google describes the RCS app as separate from Hangouts and Google+, the company recently took another step perceived as an attempt to improve Google's mobile social networking acumen. The company last week announced the hiring of Christopher Poole, the founder of the controversial 4chan site, an innovator in building online communities.\n", "deleted" : false }

To learn more about how to create visually digestible interfaces, download the free e-book Web UI Design for the Human Eye: Colors, Space, Contrast .\nVisual hierarchy is the difference between a site that strategically influences user flow and decisions, and a site that just “looks nice.”\nAn interface’s visual hierarchy relies on the same principles of aesthetics used by the Renaissance masters, but on top of that (or rather beneath it) there’s the subtext of secondary goals – promoting specific content, encouraging user signups and call-to-actions, and generally improving the overall experience so users enjoy their visit beyond just accomplishing their goals.\nSource: ShareFaith\nSeems like the Renaissance masters got off easy.\nIn basic terms, visual hierarchy describes which elements dominate your user’s attention and draw their eyes most. But there’s no one right way to build a concrete hierarchy, and competitive designers must perfect different methods – or invent new ones – to stay on top of the game.\nWe’ll describe five of the most basic elements, the essential building blocks necessary to support simple or complex hierarchies.\n1. Size\nAt the risk of sounding crass, it is the size of the boat that determines its motion in the ocean.\nBigger is more noticeable, but not always better. The simplest way to explain it is that your most important elements should be the biggest, but it’s when we get into the details that it becomes more complicated.\nOne of the principles of Fitts’s Law is that objects with a bigger size – specifically clickable range – are easier to engage with. In other words, the user exerts less effort to click bigger items. This holds especially true for calls-to-action, where you want to leave no question as to where the user should go.\nSource: Teye\nOf course, that’s not to say that it’s as simple as making your “DOWNLOAD NOW” call-to-action 10x larger for more conversions. Subtlety and harmony between elements is the key.\nFor example, what do you think the designers of the Teye website want you to interact with most?\nThe large, clickable, interactive Teye product is obviously the main attraction – and it’s obvious because of its size. In fact, no copy is even required to tell users to engage with the product – the image functions as a subtle call-to-action because of its contrasting color and size. As a result, lesser attention is demanded by the four icons around it, which actually expand in size (when you click) to give product descriptions.\nClickability aside, size is still a vital component of the site’s overall visuals. Depending on the degree, larger elements can dominate even our hard-wired left-to-right, up-to-down site patterns. Furthermore, because it’s based on perspective, size can also be conditionalized with contrast. You can reach the same benefits by making other elements smaller instead of one element larger – keep that in mind as a useful way of saving screen real estate.\nSize affects even text and typography, as you can see by this very article’s title, subheadings, and content text. As flexible guidelines, Smashing Magazine’s study of 50 popular websites calculated some average sizes:\nheadings: 18-29 pixels\nSource: Huge Inc.\nAll the principles of size are visible in this screenshot from Huge Inc. The first thing you notice is the biggest: the stylistic H that serves as their logo. Next is “Nike Making,” whose large typeface and bold style create immediate weight. Next is the line of text directly beneath it, written in a smaller font size so as not to steal attention from the key visuals. If your eyes are still interested enough to wander, they’ll eventually notice the tiny logo and hamburger menu in the corners, or the navigation bar to the right.\nThe hierarchy makes sense here. First, the large colorful H catches your eye. Soon afterwards, you’ll seek context for the unorthodox visual, which is immediately accessible with the hyperlinked “Nike Making” headline and secondary sentence. Visual hierarchy lays out the user path, while Fitts’ Law simplifies interaction by making the entire chunk of copy clickable and in close proximity to its related visual.\nWithout even thinking about it, you end up clicking exactly where the designer wants you to go.\n2. Color\nYour choice of color, even if it’s just blacks and whites, will have an enormous influence on how users perceive your site.\nFor starters, each color has its own psychological connections, which we explain in great detail in Web UI Design for the Human Eye . Barring that for a moment, colors themselves have their own hierarchy, where blacks and reds will more readily draw attention, while soft yellows and creams may take a backseat.\nHowever, those effects can be enhanced – and even reversed – by the use of contrast. Contrasting colors against their natural opposite (known as complementary colors ) draws greater attention to both. This has an enormous impact on visual hierarchy, as placing a yellow call-to-action against a blue background may produce better results than a red CTA.\nSource: Vito Salvatore\nNaturally, the website of digital designer and art director Vito Salvatore should include compelling visuals. And the photo he chose for his home page demonstrates his ability. In terms of color, the tan of the sand contrasts with the deep blue of the sky, making this a visually dynamic image. For functionality, the choice of white for the typography allows the links to stand out elegantly, despite the grandeur of the background photography.\nOn a subtler level, the tan color actually complements the blue sky, as you can see in this color wheel . While that might be pure coincidence in the photograph, it nonetheless creates a balanced feel in the aesthetic. Notice also how the tan dust trail creates a sense of action, leading your eyes towards the red car (which then points in the direction of the white text menu).\nWhen we deconstruct the design, you can really start to see how the color, visuals, and typography lead your eye towards the most valuable part of the screen.\n3. Layout\nYour website interface’s layout is one of the most direct ways to control your visual hierarchy – you can literally place an element at the top of the visual hierarchy by placing it front-and-center. But there’s more at play than just height on the screen.\nOne of these factors are prime pixels . Another principle of Fitt’s Law, which we’ve briefly described, is to take advantage of the locations within easiest reach. In web design these are, amongst others, the corners and border of the screen, as “throwing” the cursor to sides requires less mouse control than a fixed point in the middle.\nSource: Adoratorio\nWhile you’ll probably focus primarily on the center of the screen (given its size and contrasting black lines), the stagnant clickable links remain easily accessible in the corner and at the bottom. Scrolling up and down changes what’s displayed in the middle, but the site logo, hamburger menu, contact information, and social media links stay firmly in their prime locations.\nOf course, your layout certainly affects the visual hierarchy, not to mention usability. The Gestalt principles (described below) dictate that objects in a line create momentum to propel eyesight forward, even dominating the effects of color. Rows and columns, then, aside from supporting an organized structure to keep the chaos at bay, also create some prime real estate when they end – perfect for CTAs or other preferred content.\nSource: Huncwot\nAs you can see, Huncwot keeps the options for its homepage organized in a straight horizontal line (with an animation behind whichever selection you’re hovering over).\nWhen deciding the layout, remember what we said about Hick’s law in Interaction Design Best Practices . Hicks law, in a nutshell, cites that the more decisions a person has, the longer the decision-making process. Thus, you want to find a perfect balance between giving your users a lot of options and restricting their choices to only the essentials. This will affect which layout method you choose, as you don’t want to overburden your user with content, but you also want to provide enough to satisfy them.\nIt’s a tricky balance, but mandatory for every single website. Otherwise, if you crowd your website with too many interface elements, your visual hierarchy flattens and nothing stands out to the user.\n4. Spacing\nRelated to layout, the spacing within your interface guides the eye and, under the right circumstances, explains or suggests function. Spacing impacts your visual hierarchy in two distinct ways: proximity and negative space.\nProximity is a powerful tool for a web designer as it can suggest an element’s meaning and functionality using only visuals. The Gestalt principles , from the visual-psychological school of thought from the early twentieth century, led to the discovery that users tends to perceive elements placed close together as having similar functions.\nSource: In Pieces\nThe spacing for the In Pieces page demonstrates the Gestalt’s grouping principles.\nElements related to the central image are directly beneath it. The sites content, with related navigation options, are grouped together at the right. The navigation controls for the site as a whole are grouped together at the left, and non-navigational links for the entire site are grouped together at the bottom. On a related note, also notice how it takes advantage of prime pixels by placing important scrolling options on the horizontal borders.\nAnother aspect is negative space , commonly known as white space. It’s a rookie mistake in web design to treat white space as an empty canvas rather than as a design tool. Skilled designers know the less elements you have, the more potent the ones that remain. The right amount of empty space between your crucial elements will keep them the center of attention.\nSource: Nua Bikes\nNua Bikes makes good use of negative space. With its minimalistic approach and lack of conflicting visuals, the site sets the users’ focus on only what’s important – the bike it’s selling.\nTo learn more about the power of negative space, we highly recommend this A List Apart article by designer Mark Boulton. He explores negative space in greater detail, deconstructing its active and passive elements, as well as categorizing negative space as micro or macro white space.\n5. Style\nWe don’t mean to give the impression that web design is a quantifiable practice with only one way of doing things. Personal style, such as the use of textures, graphics, and the type of imagery (e.g. icon or photo-heavy), all affect the visual hierarchy and allow you to express an individual design persona .\nOne of the most powerful stylistic tools is texture . When used properly, texture enjoys the same advantages of size and color (in terms of aesthetic appeal) while adding depth and atmosphere . The clearest example of this is in displacement: giving just a single element texture will make it stand out, while having a textured background will make non-textured objects in the foreground stand out.\nSource: Le Mystère de Grimouville\nAs you can see above on Le Mystère de Grimouville, the texture on the title not only draws attention to it, it also infuses a quaint atmosphere and style to the site. The texture, as well as the size and place, set the title apart from the less important body text.\nThe mysterious effect is perfect, considering that the site tells the story of a mystery that haunted the 140 residents of Normandy for over four years.\nSource: Jib Strategic\nTaking an opposite approach, Jib Strategic adds texture to the background to draw out the foreground. This not only influences the users’ focus, it creates an old-fashioned style with the grainy wood, but still appears modern with crisp typography and graphics.\nIn addition to texture, the types of graphics and imagery you use also affects your visual hierarchy. A swirling flourish around the logo draws attention and reflect the site’s personality. Likewise, rich photographs or clever icons will be sure to draw the eye, regardless of your site’s layout or color scheme.\nSource: Risotteria Melotti\nNot to downplay the use of color in Risotteria Melotti’s site , but it’s the allure of the content – a delicious-looking meal – that makes it the most appetizing item on the screen. In fact, the texture in this site isn’t executed in the traditional format of gradients, shading, or somewhat photo-realistic effects. Just by using a rich photograph showing a rustic dinner table, we can still feel the texture of the environment permeating the screen.\nBecause the photograph sits in the background, the interface objects (mostly are still clear and we get the same feeling of atmosphere\nDon’t underestimate the power of human interest when designing visuals, as they can sometimes trump rules thought to be set-in-stone. When it comes to texture, remember that moderation is the key – otherwise you’ll end up going full-skeuomorphic which just feels tacky.\nTakeaway\nKnowing how to use each of these building blocks is a standard requirement for a web designer, but know when to use which – and even better, how to use them together – is what creates a mastery of the skill. Every element in your interface will intermingle and vie for visual dominance. Even if your design is pixel-perfect, each user will bring with them an element of unpredictability (for example, User A might have a preference for the color green…).\nKeep in mind that this is not only a science but an art – feel free to experiment and allow your own creativity shine.\nTo learn more about how to create visually digestible interfaces, download the free e-book Web UI Design for the Human Eye: Colors, Space, Contrast .

Network owners are busily studying their sales systems to make sure they integrate well with increasingly automated buying systems at media agencies and can handle the increasing flow of data that is being used to optimize and evaluate ad campaigns.\nHaving a system that smoothly provides oversight of transactions from rate cards and constraints to schedules and stewardship also can save time and money.\nWideOrbit says its WO Network ad sales system has already been launched at sixteen Viacom properties and that it expects to have all of Viacom’s portfolio running on the software by the third quarter. WideOrbit says WO Network’s functions have allowed Viacom to replace and consolidate several legacy systems and external tools.\nEarlier this year, Viacom consolidated much of its ad sales management, with its music, entertainment and kids networks all reporting to ad sales chief Jeff Lucas.\n\"The media business is changing and for players like Viacom, the supply equation and inventory management is becoming increasingly complex. Integrated systems that can solve a lot of yield challenges and provide comprehensive view of inventory landscape are the wave of the future,\" said Viacom executive VP and COO of ad sales John Halley.\n“We feel WideOrbit has the best engineering team and is the best resourced player in the business,” Halley added. “Their system gives us significant workflow efficiencies, with sophisticated embedded capabilities around yield and log management.\"\nWideOrbit says its systems have been installed in 3,000 networks and stations and manage more than $30 billion in advertising sales.\n“We couldn’t be more pleased to extend our relationship to providing the advertising management platform for Viacom’s Media Networks,” said WideOrbit founder and CEO Eric Mathewson. “Large customers like Viacom are installing WideOrbit solutions to eliminate inefficiency in their advertising operations.

The more tags you have, each calling for a bid, the greater the likelihood that the page load will be delayed.\n“There are only so many header scripts you can add” before latency kicks in, he said.\nThis latency is bad news for publishers, who are already battling the growth of ad blocking software, propelled in large part because users are annoyed by the slow loading time of ad-heavy pages.\nWith Biddr+, the multiple demand sources reside in a “container” on bRealTime’s platform, and the container is called with a single tag. The demand sources submit competing bids, and Biddr+ sends its highest bid to the publisher’s ad server.\nBiddr+ integrates with a publisher’s ad server. The container’s winning bid then can compete against, say, the ads that the publisher’s own sales people have directly sold. The winner of this final auction — all of which takes place in fractions of a second — runs the ad in the available page space.\nWeigel said that there is no added latency for this process, because the buyers in the container have a publisher-customizable “time out,” which has a default of 500 milliseconds. This means that they have, say, 500 milliseconds to submit their bid, or they don’t participate in the round.\nOther ad tech providers are similarly trying to solve the problem of having more bidders without slowing down page load. For instance, Technorati, a publisher ad platform and network, launched a container-based offering called SmartWrapper in July. And there are similar offerings from open source header bidding solutions like Prebid.js .\nWeigel told me that one of bRealTime’s differentiators “is that we are offering more managed service solutions” for the publisher, such as backend integration.\nHe also noted that bRealTime bills “off the publisher ad server counts,” meaning that his company takes the winning price from the ad server’s pricing scheme, instead of what might be conflicting prices coming from the container’s auction. In other words, it’s the price the publisher thinks she’s getting.\nbRealTime is a division of global digital media company CPXi. In addition to the new Biddr+, it also offers two other header bidding products: Biddr, which integrates the bRealTime marketplace for competition against the publisher’s demand stack, and a Biddr API, for header bidding integration with regular API protocol.\nAbout The Author\nBarry Levine\nBarry Levine covers marketing technology for Third Door Media.

(NYSE:SFE) led a $3.35 million Series C financing round for Swaptree.com, an internet-based service that leverages a proprietary trading technology to enable users to swap books, CDs, DVDs and video games for free.\nBased in Boston, MA, Swaptree.com will use the proceeds of the financing round for continued technological and operational development, marketing support and senior management recruitment.\nWith over 100,000 trades completed since its public launch in July 2007, the Swaptree.com website allows consumers to obtain items in a way that is cost-effective, friendly to the environment, and rooted in the basic notion of sharing. Unlike auction sites, classified ad services, or other e-commerce sites which sell used items, Swaptree.com is completely free, and doesn’t involve buying or selling.\nAfter signing up for the service, consumers simply add items they would like to trade to their “have list”, and put items they would like to receive on their “want list.” Swaptree’s trading engine then instantly shows the user all the items they can receive in return for the items they are trading. The only expense members incur is the cost of shipping, for which labels can be purchased and printed directly from the Swaptree website.\n“Swaptree has built a defensible technology platform that enables multi-way trading, and is well positioned to tap into the millions of users who purchase items such as books, CDs, DVDs and video games online,” said Peter J. Boni, President and CEO of Safeguard .\nBy the end of the year, Swaptree will have a million items listed for trade, making it easy for users to use the website to discover new authors, musicians, films, and games for free.\nShare !\ntweet\nAbout Social Guy\nSocial Guy is a tech buff, online entrepreneur and social animal.

Now the press service is talking about attaching licensing fees to all of its content.\n| Topic: Enterprise Software\nThe Associated Press created a feeding frenzy when it first filed seven Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) take-down notices against the Drudge Retort , claiming that the blog aggregator violated fair use copyright guidelines when repurposing The A.P.'s content. As ZDNet's Denise Howell pointed out on Monday, The A.P.'s attempt to set more clear re-use standards for bloggers is an uphill battle, as \"the legal standard is unclear, and subject to interpretation on a case by case basis.\"\nIt appeared at first that The A.P. was heeding community outcry when Saul Hansell of the New York Times reported that Jim Kennedy, vice president and strategy director of The A.P, claimed the goliath news service was going to reconsider its policies :\n“We don’t want to cast a pall over the blogosphere by being heavy-handed, so we have to figure out a better and more positive way to do this,” Mr. Kennedy said.\nThe situation, however, has now morphed from a slap on the wrist and into a dollars and cents game. Yesterday BetaNews reported that The A.P. is now instead assessing a licensing fee for republished content, which looks a little something like this:\n5-25 words:  $12.50\n101-250 words: $50.00\n251 words and up: $100.00\nTim Conneally makes some fair points in his coverage of the new fees, calling out all of the potentially convoluted situations in which both The A.P. and the bloggers could find themselves considering fuzziness around the U.S. Copyright Act and the fact that bloggers could potential quote a subscribing newspaper vs. The A.P. itself. Conneally also poses the question of whether simple commonly used introductory phrases or attributions would be considered in the word count for the fines.\nConcerns for this usage restriction go far beyond bloggers alone at this point. What happens to companies who receive news coverage via The A.P. and want post it on corporate sites, social media newsrooms or corporate blogs? Will they be assessed a fee, too? Even further, will The A.P. soon start charging teachers and students who participate in news evaluation projects in the classroom? \"I'm sorry Tommy, you'll get an 'F' unless you pay $12.50 out of your allowance to The A.P.\" Or maybe little Tommy would be protected as long as he didn't publish his analysis on his Web site.\nAnother quote from Hansell's NYT article on the matter:\n“We are not trying to sue bloggers,” Mr. Kennedy said. “That would be the rough equivalent of suing grandma and the kids for stealing music. That is not what we are trying to do.”\nTry or not, I fear that may be the direction in which The A.P. is moving. Perhaps I am taking this a bit too far (especially in exploiting little Tommy) but this is the type of situation that can quickly escalate out of control and shake an industry. While The A.P. certainly is not metal band material, nor to Kennedy's point has it yet engaged in any law suits against bloggers, the situation reeks of the same type of censorship concerns debated during the Metallica vs. Napster fan law suit several years back. While Metallica (and the other musical acts behind the suit) likely never intended to create the legal monster that it did, the music industry was never the same. Music sharing permanently moved to a paid model. And, well, Metallica lost a lot of fans.\nThe A.P. will meet tomorrow with the Media Bloggers Association to discuss, and with hope, hammer out a more reasonable workaround for bloggers who want to use The A.P.'s content. Some bloggers already claim to be done with The A.P., many going as far to participate in an organized a boycott of the press service's articles , touting a petition and encouraging others to use Reuters and smaller news organizations who have not seemingly taken an offensive stance against the blogosphere.\nView related articles on TechMeme .\nJoin Discussion\n", "deleted" : false }

First up, as a bunch of folks have sent in, some bloggers are noting that, despite the AP's own claims about quotes over five words long no longer being fair use, AP reporters often quote huge chunks of text from bloggers . That link discusses an AP article just this week that quoted 154 words from a blog. So will these \"new guidelines\" that the AP is supposedly working on with bloggers include guidelines for itself? What about payment and licensing terms? And, honestly, what happens if a blog now quotes the passages quoted in the AP article itself . At 154 words, will they receive a DMCA takedown notice?\nOh, and as for that supposed \"meeting\" to hammer out guidelines with the \"Media Bloggers Association,\" it turns out that's quite an exaggeration as well. With a bunch of folks questioning who put the previously unheard of \"Media Bloggers Association\" in charge of determining what bloggers will accept, an interview with the head of that group shows that his meeting isn't to hammer out any such guidelines -- but was simply intended to present the Drudge Retort's side of the story . Rogers Cadenhead asked the head of the group to speak on his behalf to the AP. It's the AP that's turned this meeting into the Media Bloggers Association representing all bloggers, rather than just Cadenhead.\nSo, now we've got the AP caught not just breaking its own rules (by a wide, wide margin), but also exaggerating the nature of the \"conversation\" it's supposedly having with the bloggers who are upset by its actions. Do people still think that bloggers were overreacting in calling the AP out on its actions?\n", "deleted" : false }

On the addressable TV side, platforms like Sky AdSmart let advertisers target one out of four UK households using household addressable attributes.\nWest spoke with AdExchanger about Sky’s dynamic ad-serving developments, investment interests and the latest on the build-out of its sell-side platform.\nAdExchanger: What does dynamic ad insertion do for the advertiser?\nJAMIE WEST: It allows us to ad serve/decision in the moment, rather than pre-fetching ads and stitching them into live and linear streams. It gives us a lot more optionality. \nHas server-side stitching been effective for UK publishers to fight ad blocking?\nI think IAB numbers in the UK show an increase in 15% to 18% of consumers who had an ad blocker. For Sky, most of the streaming video services are in-app, so the implications of ad-blocking software are slightly different than on the browser.\nOne thing we noticed when we put out a study on addressable advertising both on video on demand and in linear TV – we found that when we served a targeted or addressable ad, channel switching or flipping reduced by 32%. It’s our supposition that where we serve more targeted, more engaged advertising, we have more engaged audiences. The experience is that much better in a targeted environment than in a catch-all environment.\nWho are the latest adopters of addressable TV?\nOf the advertisers active on Sky AdSmart, 73% are new to Sky and 31% are brand new to TV. That’s enabling us to engage with advertisers ranging from local car dealerships and local legal practices for niche targeting based on locality, to the other end of the spectrum, which would be niche targeting in terms of audience. In April, for the first time ever, McLaren Automotive will be on TV. BlackRock has been active on the platform. Software as a service like SAP looked to reach senior decision-makers and C-suite executives. Who would have thought two or three years ago that brands like that would be using TV for the first time?\nWhat’s driving this shift from “nonendemic” advertisers?\nIt’s that unique brand-building power of TV that can cut through in a really complex media ecosystem, overlaid with this ability to bring to bear a really granular reporting and understanding through addressability.\nHow have your TV segments grown, given Sky has had an addressable TV product in-market since 2014?\nWe’ve grown that from 90 fixed attributes to well over 900 custom segments. We built out our data partnerships, from Experian to dunnhumby to MasterCard. We’ve been listening to what specific advertisers have been asking for. Whether it be those people who were in-market for car insurance or a new car or whether it be people who are regular holiday-goers, we go through a process of testing the match rates of their data sets with our customer base to see how accurate they are and then we sample and trial them to see if they’re effective for advertisers on a larger scale. Experian is a huge partner for us in data segments.\nSky Media has worked a ton with US video companies, like Videology. What have you built?\nWe’re licensing Videology’s technology to customize and architect on top of that to build our own Sky mediation layer or sell-side platform. That allows us to surface our own first-party data to enhance the ad serve and ad buy but without giving up any of that data that exists through the mediation layer – be it a DMP or a trading desk. [Using Videology with FreeWheel] allows us to ensure an ad serve in a linear stream that complies with broadcast regulation, so that we take into account time restrictions or we don’t serve a lot of high-fat or sugar ads, for example, to children. We also protect the viewer experience by ensuring we’re not serving three car ads in the same break or the same ad in five consecutive breaks.\nHow has your investment in DataXu panned out?\nDataXu is a key technology enabler for one of the products we launched last autumn called SkyAdvance, which [enables digital-like targeting] in TV. Because our multiple touch points with consumers extend beyond TV and into the digital space, whether that’s accessing content on SkyGo or on the SkySports or SkyNews app, we have a real understanding of customer journeys across the different platforms. DataXu’s role in that technology stack is not just to serve those ads on the Sky owned-and-operated platforms, but to serve those ads off-platform into the open market or through private marketplaces. There’s also a significant amount of learning we can glean from DataXu’s experience as a DSP in programmatic or addressable TV.\nWhat fuels your investment strategy?\nSky cannot build everything itself, so we’re building really strong strategic partnerships with innovative brands as a way to build out our learning and capability. Our point of view has not been as much investing for strategic stakes, but to build meaningful strategic partnerships. We’ve also invested significantly into Roku, which is our partner on our pay TV service, NOW TV. In many ways, these investments allow us to take a major step forward into understanding the technology, which enhances our learning in other sectors.\n", "deleted" : false }

If you want to access the free (well, ad-supported) content available from those sources, you’ll need to buy an outboard tuner—along with the antenna you’d need anyway—and connect the tuner to one of the TV’s HDMI inputs. The changes will apply to all of Vizio’s 4K Ultra HD TVs with SmartCast, including the new P-Series and upcoming E- and M-Series sets.\nVizio isn't cutting its customers off from OTA broadcasts, but it is making it more difficult and expensive to access them. Let's take a look at the Vizio's motivations and the impact this move could have on consumers. \nWhy drop the tuner?\nVizio’s website doesn’t really explain why its TVs are better off without built-in tuners, so I asked the company to elaborate.\nIn response, Vizio cited its own surveys, which found that less than 10 percent of customers were watching over-the-air broadcasts. The company also pointed to a 2013 Consumer Electronics Association study , which found that 7 percent of U.S. households relied on an antenna. (More on these figures later.)\nBy removing the antenna input, Vizio believes it can make a simpler product, with fewer setup setps and a less-cluttered menu. “As we continually evaluate and focus on designing products that deliver a beautifully simple experience, we felt that removing the tuner would simplify the overall setup and user experience for the vast majority of customers.” a Vizio spokesman said.\nIf a TV doesn't have an integrated ATSC tuner, the TV's owner will need to purchase an external unit, like such as this $40 MediaSonic HomeWorx.\nIt’s likely that cost was a consideration as well, though Vizio didn’t say so explicitly. The company has a reputation for offering quality TVs on the cheap, often undercutting rival TV giants like Samsung and LG. Nixing the TV tuner could allow the company to shrink its prices further; alternatively, it could just let the savings fall to its bottom line.\n“The removal of the tuner from a television feature set is almost always the result of a cost-saving measure,” Mark Buff, CEO of antenna maker Mohu, said via email.\nBuff said that while the tuner itself might not cost much, there are also licensing fees to consider. He further speculated that Vizio’s Cast-enabled sets could have a lower import duty if they defined as monitors rather than televisions. Incidentally, Vizio’s website refers to the new sets as “displays,” not TVs.\nVizio did not comment on this potential cost-saving loophole.\nThe cost of “tuner-free” TVs\nFor cord cutters who strictly stream their video, there’s nothing wrong with the prospect of a cheaper, simpler TV. Antenna users, however, are getting the opposite. The most basic external tuners, like this one from MediaSonic , cost about $40. And while that’s not a high price if you’re saving hundreds of dollars per year by ditching cable TV, the cost of not having a built-in tuner is more than just monetary.\nOne concern is that Vizio is creating a barrier for prospective cord cutters. Part of OTA TV's appeal is that it doesn’t require a chain of new hardware. Sure, OTA DVRs and networked TV tuners can make the antenna experience better ; but for basic live TV, you can do just fine by plugging the antenna straight into the television and running a channel scan. Figuring out what hardware you need to cut the cord is hard enough without throwing TV-tuner boxes into the equation.\nThe antenna’s plug-and-play simplicity is part of the appeal.\nEven after you’ve set up the hardware, the viewing experience becomes more complicated when a tuner box is involved. Whereas a built-in tuner lets you change channels directly with your TV’s remote, a separate box requires a separate remote control. That means you need two remotes—one for changing channels, another for volume and other core TV functions—where a single remote used to suffice.\nThe sad thing is that Vizio could have been an over-the-air innovator. With its tablet-based remote control and SmartCast app , the opportunity exists to create rich channel guides, watchlists, and reminders for antenna users. Instead, that opportunity will fall to streaming-box makers and antenna companies. (Mohu’s Mark Buff says to “stay tuned” on that front.)\nWhile Vizio might counter that such features aren’t worth building for the less-than 10 percent of its customers who watch OTA broadcasts, keep in mind that antenna use is growing. In the third quarter of 2015, Nielsen found that 12.8 million U.S. homes were relying solely on antenna, up from 12.2 the year before. That doesn’t even include homes that are combining antenna broadcasts and streaming. While other companies like Amazon and Best Buy are picking up on that trend by bundling antennas and streaming devices together, Vizio is moving against the grain.\nUltimately, Vizio’s “Tuner-Free TV” efforts aren’t a big deal if shoppers have other options; and for now, no other major TV makers have nixed ATSC tuners from their sets. But as one of the most popular TV makers in the United States, Vizio has the power to define consumer behavior and set trends.\nFor many people, the antenna is a vital supplement to streaming video when cutting the cord. While Vizio may believe that streaming is the future, making its TVs tuner-free could make it harder for people to get there.\nRelated:\n", "deleted" : false }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5725fec4b3c1e50001a271ba" }, "companyIDs" : [ "consumer-electronics-association" ], "title" : "Do We Need To Put Drones On A Tighter Leash?", "date" : { "$date" : "2016-04-27T00:00:00.000+0000" }, "URL" : "http://www.alleywatch.com/2016/04/need-put-drones-tighter-leash", "content" : "Subscribe Google Whatsapp Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Buffer Pocket Xing Tumblr Mail\n \nDrones are showing up at airports, on federal land and on the Internet, and they are starting to make some lawmakers, and some members of the public very nervous.\nBetween showing up in places they are not supposed to be , interfering with activities such as firefighting and being turned into casual weapons, the concerns have caused regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration to launch investigations, and led some lawmakers to call for tougher rules.\nHowever, observers inside and outside the industry are divided as to which rules can be practically implemented and whether they will prove to be needlessly onerous to legitimate users of the growing technology. Some also say that there is too little clarity over what is permitted now, and what may be allowed in the near future, which is deterring some would-be drone users from adopting the technology.\nThe market for both recreational and commercial use is growing fast and shows no sign of letting up. The Consumer Electronics Association recently reported that drone sales in the United States are expected to total $105 million in 2015, up more than 50 percent from last year. The group expects 700,000 drones to be sold by the end of 2015.\n“I think that what is interesting about this technology is that its accessibility is evolving faster than regulation,” said Margot Kaminski, an assistant professor of law at Ohio State University. The issue is that they are being widely adopted by unlicensed, untrained people, and regulators in this field, particularly the FAA, are not used to managing that kind of user, she said.\nReports of various dubious drone activities keep trickling in. In the last week, four different commercial airline crews reported spotting drones near New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.\nWorries are not just limited to airlines.\nLast January, a hobby drone crash-landed on the White House lawn, after a man who lived in the area lost contact with it. Flying drones outdoors is illegal in Washington, D.C., but the man was not charged. Early in July, an 18-year-old from Connecticut posted a video on YouTube showing a tricked-out drone mounted with a pistol—that successfully fired.\nDrone activity has also hampered firefighting activities in the West, forcing agencies to ground firefighting planes. The machines are potentially a threat to low-flying airplanes, including the planes that drop fire retardant on wildfires, or helicopters that transport medical patients.\nAfter drone sightings forced wild land firefighters to ground planes in California’s San Bernardino Mountains, U.S. Rep. Paul Cook, R-Calif., introduced a bill into Congress called the Wildfire Airspace Protection Act of 2015. If implemented, the bill would impose a fine and up to five years in prison for anyone convicted of flying a drone that interferes with firefighting planes on federal land.\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who represents communities near Los Angeles, has also asked the FAA to consider mandating “geofencing” technology in civilian drones—essentially a technology that prevents drones from flying into specific areas\n“We are urging the FAA to consider the options available to stop commercial drones from interfering with first responders, including technological measures like geofencing which prevent drones from flying in a restricted airspace. … We are not prescribing any particular technological solution, but given the clear danger posed by the reckless use of civilian drones near wildfires as well as airports, it’s appropriate for the FAA to consider all measures within their authority,” said a statement sent to CNBC by Schiff’s office.\nCould new rules be enforced?\nControlling drones through regulation or legislation may be easier said than done.\nFor one thing, the legal structure surrounding the use of drones is a bit of a patchwork. The FAA has issued guidelines and a few hard rules for operators, and is considering implementing stricter rules. The agency says it intends to finalize rules by the end of 2015.\nThe FAA currently considers any drone less than 55 pounds and used for noncommercial purposes to be akin to a model airplane. There are still rules for those craft, including staying away from manned aircraft such as passenger planes, flying below 400 feet to avoid other aircraft and keeping the drone within the operator’s line of sight.\nAnything larger needs to be certified with an “aero modeling community-based organization” that is presumably training its members to pilot larger craft.\nIf users are going to pilot drones for any kind of commercial purpose—including things such as professional journalism—they require special permission from the FAA. The agency recently announced that it has handed out 1,000 such certificates so far, for industries as far ranging as film production, real estate and agriculture.\nIn addition, local governments have instituted drone-specific laws, and some law enforcement authorities have suggested that drone users could be charged with reckless endangerment if local cops consider their drones unsafe.\nMost recently, Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., called for the implementation of geofencing technology. Installing it, “seems to be the simplest and most effective way to ensure safety,” according to a statement issued by Schumer’s office in February. “This technology also takes human error out of the equation.”\nStaff members at Schumer’s offices in New York City and Washington, D.C., did not return requests for comment.\nEven if some of these measures are put in place, it may be too late for them to be effective.\nGiven the number of drones that are already in the hands of users, it’s hard to see how geofencing could be implemented in any useful way, said John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n“I just don’t see how geofencing would work,” Hansman told CNBC. “There are already so many of these drones out there and more are already being sold every day.”\nYou can read more at: Facebook: Drone ready for testing later this year\nMany of the proposed rules cover what is considered common sense, even in the industry. “Unmanned aircraft shouldn’t be flying close to airports, close to manned aircraft or above 400 feet,” said Tom McMahon, a spokesman for the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AVUSI) in a statement sent to CNBC. “These are common-sense guidelines, but many new UAS enthusiasts aren’t taking the time to understand where they should and should not fly.”\nMcMahon added that the AVUSI, along with the FAA and the “recreational community” are working to place materials in product packaging that inform customers about safety and laws.\n“It is generally not good to have a piece of technology that crudely restricts how you use something.” -Ryan Calo, Professor of law at the University of Washington\nMoreover, the “drone” category is incredibly broad, and can include large sophisticated unmanned vehicles weighing hundreds or even thousands of pounds as well as tiny and inexpensive “micro drones” sold as toys or hobby items. Enforcing the placement of geofencing technology on all of these might be prohibitively difficult, Hansman said.\nA more practical approach would be to find better ways of catching the people who misuse them, Hansman said. “A lot of these, especially the smaller hobby drones are run by radio control, like a model airplane. Therefore, you can track the location of the signals being sent to the device. That technology has already been around for a long time,” he said.\nRyan Calo, a professor of law at the University of Washington, does not care for restrictive technological measures such as geofencing, saying they might not work as planned and could prevent owners from using drones in ways that are perfectly legal and potentially beneficial.\n“It is generally not good to have a piece of technology that crudely restricts how you use something,” Calo said.\nFor example, some companies have already tried to place geofencing technology in their drones, resulting in glitches or unexpected consequences that have prevented drones from doing things that would otherwise be safe, he said.\nIn addition, Calo said, many laws already in place could apply to drone users. The FAA has already banned all drones from flying within a certain distance of airports, and there are already laws against interfering with emergency workers, such as firefighters.\n“I would say that we don’t need additional laws around use of drones, but rather we need people to comply with laws we already have,” Calo told CNBC. “There are all kinds of ways you can behave irresponsibly … this is not the first time we have had to integrate new technology.”\nThe lack of regulatory clarity—plus the fact that some local governments have stricter laws than others—may contribute to consumer confusion on proper use. There is also no training or education for drone buyers.\n“There is an incredibly loud and justified group that is pointing out that the government is taking too long to put clear rules in place,” said Ohio State’s Kaminski “There are real lost jobs due to the amount of time that the FAA is taking to regulate drones.”\n“That said, you don’t want to regulate too quickly, because you might either pass too many regulations, or you won’t pass enough and you will get these high-profile incidents like we are seeing now. It is a balance between regulating too quickly and banning things that you want or regulating too slowly and unintentionally allowing things that could be harmful,” Kaminski said.\n“But, comparatively, the U.S. is moving very slowly,” she said.\nThat said it might not be fair to saddle the FAA with the task of regulating every aspect of drone use.\n“The FAA is not used to regulating things that are cheap and widely used. That makes [drones] ill-suited for FAA-based regulation,” Kaminski said. “The FAA is only part of the answer.”\n \nImage credit: CC by  Richard Unten\n360\n", "deleted" : false }

The resonators were firstly designed and fabricated, then annealed and processed by chemical etching to increase mechanical quality factor (Q factor) of resonators, which achieved as high as 2.89 million for n = 2 wineglass modes after being coated with PZT thin film electrodes. The n = 2 wineglass modes of the resonators were driven by PZT thin film electrodes in experiment and simulation with fine vibratory shape, which demonstrated the feasibility of the cylindrical fused silica resonator driven by PZT thin film electrodes. The application of PZT thin film electrodes to drive and detect cylindrical shell fused silica resonator can significantly improve Q factor of resonators and improve the sensitivity of Coriolis Vibratory Gyroscope (CVG).\nIntroduction\nGyroscopes are key components of inertial navigation systems for detecting the angular motion of objects. Coriolis vibratory gyroscopes (CVGs) are simple in structure with no mechanical rotors, low energy loss, easy maintenance, high durability and high reliability. In the past few decades, the CVG has been studied extensively, including the hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG), the cylindrical resonator gyroscope (CRG), etc. Northrop Grumman’s HRGs have worked over 35 million hours without mission failure 1 , 2 . Meanwhile, the bias stability of the HRG developed by SAFRAN Inc. achieved better than 0.001 deg/h, and they have been widely used in different inertial systems successfully 3 . For high precision CVG, the high Q factor shell resonator is the key component. Both the hemispherical resonators produced by Northrop Grumman and SAFRAN Inc. have achieved the Q factor more than 107 4 , 5 . By contrast, CRGs produced by Innalabs Inc. based on cylindrical shell resonators of metal materials only achieved a bias stability of 0.03–0.1 deg/h, owing to the Q factors of metal resonators, which are usually less than 105 6 , 7 . In the field of micro CVG, micro birdbath resonator gyroscopes have improved their bias stabilities from 1 deg/h to 0.0391 deg/h with the Q factor nearly reaching 107 8 , 9 , 10 . Meanwhile, self-induced parametric amplification has been introduced to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in micro resonating disk gyroscope 11 . High precision CVGs are usually equipped with high Q factor resonators because the drift characteristics of CVG pertain to the Q factor of resonators. However, compared with HRG, under the same processing precision (surface roughness, mass mismatch, concentricity tolerance, etc.) requirements, CRG has simpler mechanical processing, shorter manufacturing cycle and higher yield. Consequently, the development of cylindrical shell resonators with high Q factors can improve the precision of CRGs while reducing production costs significantly.\nResonators are usually made of metal, ceramic, fused silica or other materials. Among them, fused silica is ideal for shell resonators because of its excellent isotropic properties and extremely high Q factors. Previously we have presented monolithic cylindrical fused silica resonators with Q factors approaching 8 × 105 12 . In comparison, the piezoelectric effect of PZT has been widely used in driving and detecting in CRGs because of its excellent frequency response characteristics. However, the Q factor of PZT materials is much lower than that of fused silica, and therefore the overall Q factor of cylindrical fused silica resonators will decrease drastically when PZT lamination electrodes (thickness more than 200 μm, including the top and bottom metal electrodes and the middle PZT lamination) are attached. We also experimentally verified that thinner PZT lamination electrodes were more conducive to maintain the Q factor at a higher value 13 . Moreover, PZT lamination electrodes are usually attached to the resonator by epoxy resin adhesives, which will also reduce the Q factor of resonators and degrade the performance of the CRG 14 .\nThe electrostatic driving scheme and piezoelectric driving scheme, both of which were designed to drive the resonators, have been illustrated in detail 15 , 16 . The electrostatic driving scheme has a sophisticated design with a high driving voltage (more than 100 V) 17 , resulting in an unsatisfactory driving efficiency. While the piezoelectric driving scheme has simplified mechanical structures and circuits, the Q factor of the resonators dropped dramatically after attaching PZT lamination electrodes 13 . Therefore, cylindrical shell resonators driven by PZT thin film electrodes were proposed and investigated through simulations and experiments in this paper, and the hypothesis that fused silica resonators can be driven effectively while maintaining a high Q factor after coating with PZT thin film electrodes was tested. PZT thin films have been researched extensively and widely used in the field of MEMS over the past few decades. In 1963, Foster of Bell LABS reported successfully producing an ultrasonic transducer by using CdS thin films 18 . In 1965, Foster and Rozgonyi created ZnO film transducers by reactively sputtering zinc in oxygen 19 . In 1979, Shiosaki et al. successfully attached AlN films to the substrate of glass and metal by rf reactive planar magnetron sputtering 20 . In 2004, Zinck et al. pointed out that the positive and inverse piezoelectric effect of PZT thin film electrodes can be used as vibration actuators in MEMS. They coated 800 nm of PZT thin film electrodes on a 10 μm silicon substrate, and using film actuation, the substrate produced a vibration displacement of 2 μm 21 . In 2010, Aktakka et al. reported the high performance of the piezoelectric energy collector based on PZT thin film electrodes. They also suggested the possibility of using PZT thin film technology to produce high-efficiency vibration actuators. In addition, they mentioned that reducing the dielectric loss and the mechanical damping of films improved the overall Q factor of the system 22 . However, to our knowledge, no articles have investigated the feasibility of coating PZT thin film electrodes on macro cylindrical shell resonators for the purpose of driving and detection.\nIn this paper, two types of resonators named Ge01 and Ge02 were designed and fabricated. Post-processing techniques such as annealing and chemical etching were utilized to improve the Q factor of resonators. The feasibility of cylindrical shell resonators driven by PZT thin film electrodes was investigated through simulations and experiments, aimed at reducing the Q factor drop rate of the resonator-films structure. We present, for the first time, a fused silica shell resonator with a Q factor of 2.89 million after coating with PZT thin film electrodes. Moreover, compared with the traditional technical scheme, the positioning accuracy of coating PZT thin film electrodes is higher, which may greatly reduce the asymmetry drift error and has potential to help develop the CRG with high precision, small size and low cost.\nMaterials\nStructure design of resonators\nThe structure of cylindrical fused silica resonators has been reported in ref. 12 . In order to adapt to the coating process of PZT thin film electrodes, we slightly changed the bottom structure of resonators based on the initial structure. For Ge01, we reduced the diameter of the bottom holes to 3 mm. For Ge02, we removed the bottom holes. Before the resonators were fabricated, the Ansys Multiphysics 14.0 software was employed to investigate the resonant frequency of resonators in n = 2 wineglass mode and its adjacent modes. The simulation results of n = 1 mode to n = 3 mode of Ge01 and Ge02 are depicted in Fig.  1 . The resonant frequencies of n = 1 mode to n = 3 mode are listed in Table  1 .\nFigure 1\nFull size table\nThe simulation showed that the frequencies of n = 2 wineglass mode were 4905.4 Hz (Ge01) and 4915.1 Hz (Ge02).\nThe fabricated fused silica resonators are shown in Fig.  2 , and the only difference between them is the presence of bottom holes. The sizes of the rest of the resonator are consistent with the original design: The diameter of resonators, height of the vibration conducting shell and height of the resonant shell were 25 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm, respectively.\nFigure 2\nThe structure of fused silica cylindrical resonators: (a) Bottom hole; (b) Bottom plate; (c) Anchor stem; (d) Vibration conducting shell; (e) Resonant shell.\nFull size image\nPZT thin films electrodes\nThe film quality and the driving ability of PZT thin film electrodes were firstly investigated by coating the films onto a fused silica rectangular substrate. The length, width and thickness of PZT thin film electrodes (composed of the middle PZT layer, the top and bottom Ti/Pt electrode layers) were 19.6 mm, 4 mm and 2 μm, respectively, while those of the substrate was 25 mm, 4.5 mm and 1 mm, respectively. The fused silica substrates before and after coating are shown in Fig.  3(a) . Ideally, the PZT layer acts as an insulator and changes shape when an electric field is applied. However, in the actual films, due to defects, there will be a tiny current in the PZT layer when an electric field is applied, which is the leakage current. On this account, the leakage current of the whole PZT thin film electrodes on the rectangular fused silica substrate was tested by a probe-type current meter. The results, as depicted in Fig.  3(b) , showed that the leakage current increased with the applied static voltage, and the leakage current was on the level of 10−11 A under 2 V static voltage. In addition, for the purpose of further observing the surface quality of the PZT thin film electrodes, an atomic force microscope (AFM) was utilized to test its surface morphology. The surface morphology of an area of 2 μm × 2 μm is depicted in Fig.  3(c) . According to the measured data, the Nanoscope Analysis software calculation results illustrated that the surface roughness of the PZT thin film electrodes was 7.76 nm.\nFigure 3\n(a) The fused silica substrate before and after coated with the PZT thin film electrode; (b) Leakage current testing result of the PZT thin film electrode coated on the fused silica substrate; (c) The AFM scanned graph of the PZT thin film electrode in an area of 2 μm × 2 μm.\nExperimental Results and Discussion\nPost-processing of resonators\nFor cylindrical fused silica resonators, the Q factor represents the ratio of energy lost in a motion cycle of vibration to the total energy of the resonators:\n$${Q}=\\frac{2{\\rm{\\pi }}E}{\\Delta E}=\\frac{2{\\rm{\\pi }}E}{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}\\Delta {E}_{{i}}},$$\n(1)\nwhere E represents the energy stored in the resonators, ΔEi represents the energy loss in each cycle caused by the No. ith factor (thermoelastic loss, air viscous damping, anchor loss, internal friction loss, surface loss, etc. 23 , 24 , 25 ). Consequently, a higher Q factor indicates a lower overall loss of resonators. After initial processing of the fused silica resonators, a series of post-processing techniques, including annealing and chemical etching was utilized to increase the Q factor by reducing damping and loss. Besides, the bottom plate of the resonator needs mechanical polishing to meet the coating requirements.\nFor the purpose of directly detecting the vibration characteristics (resonant frequency, resonant amplitude, vibrational shape, etc.) of resonators, measurements were made using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) and a vacuum chamber, as shown in Fig.  4 . Before and after coating with PZT thin film electrodes, the resonators were driven by acoustic waves and PZT thin film electrodes, respectively. The measurement steps have been illustrated in our previous study 12 . The decay time method was employed to calculate the Q factor. The decay time represents the time duration for the resonant amplitudes, A, decreasing to A/e (e ≈ 2.718):\n$$Q=\\pi f\\tau ,$$\n(2)\nwhere f represents the resonant frequency in Hz and τ represents the decay time in seconds.\nFigure 4\nFull size image\nAnnealing\nAnnealing can reduce the internal stress of fused silica resonators due to mechanical grinding, thus greatly improving the Q factor 26 , 27 , 28 . It can also desorb oxygen molecules and water vapor in the air that adhere to the surface of resonators, and improves the Q factor by destroying the silica silanol (SiOH) bond which increases surface loss 29 . The resonant frequencies and Q factors of Ge01 and Ge02 were tested before and after annealing (driven by acoustic waves), under 1 atm. and 90 Pa in a vacuum chamber, as listed in Table  2 .\nTable 2 The testing results of the n = 2 mode of resonators before and after annealing.\nFull size table\nDuring previous experiments, we found that when the atmospheric pressure was below 100 Pa, the resonators without any post-processing were unable to be driven by acoustic waves due to high losses and the insufficiency of acoustic waves’ driving force under low atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the Q factor of resonators before annealing was measured only under 1 atm. The vibration data acquired from the LDV were processed by MATLAB, and results are depicted in Fig.  5 . The results showed that after annealing, the Q factor of Ge01 and Ge02 increased 31% (from 3093 to 4053) and 17% (from 3822 to 4466) under 1 atm., respectively. After the two resonators were put into a vacuum chamber to reduce the air viscous damping loss, the Q factors increased to 199930 (decay time 11.768 s) and 82039 (decay time 5.198 s) under 90 Pa, respectively. Moreover, annealing also slightly changed the resonant frequencies of Ge01 and Ge02, which increased by about 7.5 Hz and 8.4 Hz, respectively. It is worth noting that the measured values of resonant frequencies were different from that of simulation, as there are slight difference between the simulation input parameters and the actual material parameters, and errors in the machining process.\nFigure 5\nDecay time measurement of the two resonators: (a) Ge01 before annealing under 1 atm.; (b) Ge01 after annealing under 1 atm.; (c) Ge02 before annealing under 1 atm.; (d) Ge02 after annealing under 1 atm.; (e)Ge01 after annealing under 90 Pa; (f) Ge02 after annealing under 90 Pa.\nFull size image\nChemical etching\nChemical etching can remove the surface defect layer caused by machining of resonators by immersing resonators in suitable chemical solutions, so as to reduce the surface loss and improve Q factors 30 , 31 . The Q factors, resonant frequencies, mass variation and thickness variation of resonant shells after chemical etching are listed in Table  3 .\nTable 3 The testing results of the n = 2 mode of resonators after chemical etching.\nFull size table\nAfter chemical etching, the resonant frequencies of Ge01 and Ge02 decreased to 5137.5 Hz and 4677.8 Hz, respectively. The masses of Ge01 and Ge02 decreased to 2.5511 g (decreased by 0.2778 g) and 1.9065 g (decreased by 0.2842 g), and the thicknesses of the resonant shells decreased by 0.047 mm and 0.064 mm, respectively. The resonant frequencies were affected by both the structure’s stiffness and mass. However, while mass decreased linearly during chemical etching, the decrease in thickness led to a more significant drop of the structure stiffness and contributes more to the decrease in resonant frequencies 32 . Therefore, the combined effects of decreased mass and stiffness during chemical etching resulted in a decrease of resonant frequencies after chemical etching.\nThe pressure in the vacuum chamber decreased from 90 Pa to 10 Pa after chemical etching to further reduce the air viscous damping loss. When tested under 10 Pa (while other conditions remain unchanged), the resonant frequencies of Ge01 and Ge02 increased to 5149.1 Hz (increased by 11.6 Hz) and 4689.9 Hz (increased by 12.1 Hz), respectively. In addition, the Q factor of Ge01 increased to 1020922 with the decay time reaching 63.112 s, as depicted in Fig.  6(a) , and the Q factor of Ge02 increased to 1572983 with the decay time reaching 106.761 s, as depicted in Fig.  6(b) . Due to the corrosion of the etching solution on the surface of the resonator, the surface microcracks generated by the mechanical grinding process and the surface adsorption layer were removed. Consequently, the Q factor improved greatly after chemical etching. In order to further verify the surface promotion of resonators after chemical etching, the same surface of Ge02 before and after chemical etching was scanned at the area of 10 μm × 10 μm by AFM, as depicted in Fig.  6(c,d) .\nFigure 6\nDecay time measurement of the resonators: (a) Resonator Ge01; (b) Resonator Ge02; Surface topography of resonator Ge02: (c) before chemical etching; (d) after chemical etching.\nFull size image\nThe AFM results demonstrated that, after chemical etching, the surface of the resonator was smoother than before. The surface roughness decreased from 1.611 μm to 0.367 μm, showing that chemical etching was an effective method to reduce the surface roughness of resonators.\nAfter chemical etching, the surface roughness of bottom plate was still too large (over 100 nm) for film coating. A mechanical polishing process was introduced to further reduce the surface roughness of the bottom plates of the two resonators. The resonant frequencies of Ge01 and Ge02 were decreased to 5090.3 Hz and 4658.4 Hz, respectively, after mechanical polishing.\nSimulation of PZT thin films electrodes\nThe PZT thin film electrodes were mainly used in micro-mechanical structures. However, the cylindrical shell resonator was a macro-mechanical structure. The thickness of the PZT thin film electrodes was less than 2 μm, less than 1% of that of the PZT lamination electrodes. Hence the driving force provided by the PZT thin film electrodes is limited and smaller than that of the PZT lamination electrodes, with the result that the driving energy provided by the PZT thin film electrodes has to be larger than the loss in order to actuate and to keep the resonator in a stable resonant amplitude. Consequently, a high Q factor was needed, indicating the low loss of resonators. After post-processing, the Q factors of both Ge01 and Ge02 were over 1 million, making it possible to drive resonators using PZT thin film electrodes. In addition, it is necessary to simulate the vibration amplitude of resonators driven by PZT thin film electrodes to verify its feasibility. The vibration amplitude (denoted by A) of the resonator is directly proportional to the driving force (denoted by F) in the unit area and the Q factor of the resonator 33 :\n$$A\\propto F\\cdot Q$$\n(3)\nThe Ansys Multiphysics 14.0 software was employed to investigate the static deformation of resonators, and the results are depicted in Fig.  7 .\nFigure 7\nFull size image\nThe simulation results verified the feasibility of driving resonators with PZT thin film electrodes, and the maximum displacement at the bottom edge of the resonator Ge01 and Ge02 were 5.3 nm and 7.3 nm, respectively. In addition, the amplitude is larger when driving the resonators under sinusoidal voltage at the resonant frequency.\nCoating experiments of PZT thin film electrodes on resonators\nThe sol-gel method was utilized to coat PZT thin film electrodes on Ge01 and Ge02. During coating, the films on Ge01 cracked due to the edge-bead effect between the eight bottom holes. The holes also caused complex liquid flow directions and a non-uniform film thickness. Consequently, the films failed to work properly under the driving voltage. In contrast, eight PZT thin film electrodes were coated on the bottom plate of Ge02 successfully, as shown in Fig.  8(a) . The coating experiment results demonstrated that resonators without bottom holes were more suitable for coating high-quality PZT thin film electrodes. The thickness, length and width of the PZT thin film electrodes were 2 μm, 7 mm and 2 mm, respectively. Eight reserved bottom electrode welding spots were grounded, and eight top electrodes were used to load the driving signals or output the detection signals after welding with wires.\nFigure 8\nFull size image\nIn our previous experiment, the PZT lamination electrodes (thickness ~200 μm) were attached on the fused silica resonator (named as MacroPR), and the result illustrated that the Q factor of the resonator decreased by 96.9% (tested under 50 Pa), which was detrimental to maintaining the high Q factor of resonators. The PZT lamination electrodes attached to the fused silica resonator are shown in Fig.  8(b) .\nBoth Ge02 and MacroPR were driven by acoustic waves during the test. The testing results of Ge02 and MacroPR driven by acoustic waves were listed in Table  4 .\nTable 4 The testing results of the n = 2 mode of MacroPR and Ge02 after PZT lamination electrodes attached and PZT thin film electrodes coated, respectively.\nFull size table\nAfter coating, the resonant frequency of Ge02 changed slightly (from 4658.4 Hz to 4658.1 Hz), because the mass of the PZT thin film electrodes was very small compared with that of the resonator. Additionally, the Q factor of Ge02 decreased to 1026877 (drop rate: 34.72%, tested under 10 Pa). The drop rate is much lower than that of MacroPR.\nTesting of PZT thin film electrodes driving capability\nThe simulation results depicted in Fig.  7 have verified the driving feasibility of PZT thin film electrodes. Epoxy was used to glue the resonator on an Invar base to reduce anchor loss, and conducting resin was used to glue wires to the top and bottom electrodes of the films before testing, as shown in Fig.  9 . We tested the resonant amplitudes of Ge02 driven by PZT thin film electrodes under 2.6 × 10−2 Pa. The results are listed in Table  5 . The resonant shape of Ge02 driven by acoustic waves and PZT thin film electrodes are depicted in Fig.  10(a) and (b), respectively, while the output signal of PZT thin film electrodes detected with an oscilloscope is depicted in Fig.  10(c) . It is worth pointing out that, for a mature CRG product, PZT thin film electrodes are used both for driving the resonators and detecting signals with a direct read-out system. But so far in our initial experimental research, detecting by LDV has the advantage of easily detecting the vibration shape and amplitude, which are the key parameters during the developmental stage.\nFigure 9\nFull size image\nThe shape graphs in Fig.  10 were obtained by scanning the bottom edge of the resonator through LDV. The results demonstrated that the macro fused silica cylindrical resonator can be driven by PZT thin film electrodes successfully. When Ge02 was driven by PZT thin film electrodes under the sinusoidal voltage at 3 V (peak to peak value), the resonant amplitudes reached 14.77 nm, and the output detection signal of the PZT thin film electrodes reached about 10 mV (peak to peak value). The results showed that the driving and detection by PZT thin film electrodes can maintain the resonator in a stable working mode. To prevent the films from breaking down, the driving voltage cannot be overly high. In the future work, we will improve the coating process to improve the breakdown voltage threshold.\nTo analyze the influence of air viscous damping on Q factor, we tested the resonant amplitudes of Ge02 driven by PZT thin film electrodes under different pressure with the sinusoidal voltage at 3 V. The results are listed in Table  6 , and the variation of Q factors with different atmospheric pressures are depicted in Fig.  11(a) . The decay time under 2.6 × 10−2 Pa is depicted in Fig.  11(b) .\nTable 6 The Q factor testing results of the n = 2 mode of Ge02 under different pressures.\nGoogle Scholar\nContributions\nY.L. measured and analyzed the data, drew the figures and wrote the manuscript; T.Q. proposed the concept of cylindrical fused silica resonators driven by PZT thin film electrodes, co-wrote the manuscript; Y.L. and Y.P. completed the simulation involved in this paper; Y.C. and M.Y. fabricated the PZT thin film electrodes and gave revision advices to this paper; H.L. made suggestions on the structure of this paper and modified the original manuscript; Z.T. and J.L. fabricated the resonators and assisted in mechanical polishing process.

Apple is also expected to release its iOS 8.2 update soon–perhaps today. And for fun, here’s a list of  7 things Apple definitely won’t launch at its Apple Watch event today .\nStay tuned for more.

Somewhere along the way, it also turned into an Alexa-like analytics service. Unfortunately, neither market worked out for them and they’ve been forced to shut their doors.\nThe Digg-style service used JavaScript that was embedded on participating pages to track how often posts were read, and top-read posts were featured on Spotplex’s homepage. The service set itself apart from Digg by requiring no intervention on the reader’s part to promote a page. On the other hand, Spotplex only recorded hits on blogs that had embedded the Javascript snippets, which severely restricted its sources of content.\nSpotplex’s JavaScript embeds were also used to offer an analytics service that was designed to contend with sites like Alexa and Compete. While the addition of this service marked a shift to a very different market, both of Spotplex’s services leveraged the same backend.\nCEO Doyon Kim says that the company’s ultimate failure was due to a lack of adequate funding. The company underestimated the resources that were required to build and maintain its service, and it neglected to seek venture funding after its $450,000 seed round. This is surprising given Kim’s experience in the industry: he co-founded DialPad , which was acquired by Yahoo in 2005.\nSpotplex is now in the TechCrunch Deadpool .\n", "deleted" : false }

Online video advertising budgets are expected to jump sharply in 2012. Brand advertisers who purchased online video ads this year are projected to spend 47 percent more next year. These numbers were released this morning in the second annual “Video State of the Industry Survey” by Adap.tv and Digiday .\nFor advertisers that didn’t purchase any video ads so far this year, 84% say they will include digital video in their campaigns in Q4 2011 or 2012.\nAdvertisers say they are most likely to shift spending away from display and print ads to fund the increased online video spending. While some have feared online video might start replacing TV ad spending, the report claims television ad budgets, especially for cable, are safe for now. A majority of advertisers say online video ads are a direct compliment to TV, not a replacement for TV ads.\nThe report, which surveyed nearly 600 advertisers, publishers, and video technology providers, says rates for interactive video ads are up an average of 19 percent over last year.\nSome other key findings:\nBrand engagement is the top online video campaign objective.\nSharing video via social networks is an important return-on-investment metric for buyers.\nRich media overlays, pre-rolls, and content integration are the favorite ad formats.\nPage-roll, expanding video banners, and post-rolls are the least favorite.\nVideo ad spending on the iPad is up 18%, the highest among all devices.\nAverage CPM for Premium content, broadcast content online: $21-$30\nAverage CPM for Mid-Tier, professionally produced content: $11-$20\nAverage CPM for User Generated Content: $0 – $5\nA webcast about the findings will be streaming at Noon ET at www.digidayvideo.com . There will also be a Twitter-based Q&A at 1pm ET via @Adap.tv with the hashtag #StateofVideo . When the webcast ends, the report will be available online at www.adap.tv .\nThe business and technology of online video will also be the big topic today when the Streaming Media West conference kicks off in Los Angeles.\n", "deleted" : false }

Except for a few bucks in taxes and fees, you're looking at free home phone service for life.\n@cheapskateblog\nThe last piece of home phone hardware you'll ever need. Ooma\nQuick housekeeping note: I'll be traveling next week, and although I've lined up a couple sweet deals to occupy you during my absence, expect a few days without anything new. I'll miss you, cheeps! But, hey: mind watering the plants while I'm gone?\nAlso, today's deal is an update of one from last year -- with an even better price, of course.\nLandline, shlandine! Here at Cheapskate Central (aka Rick's house), phone service arrives over the interwebs. And for the past several years, that service has come via Ooma. Total cost for my home phone? Zero. (Well, very close to zero. Read on.)\nIf you're ready to cut the landline cord, here's your cheapest opportunity yet (Ooma-wise): For a limited time, and while supplies last, Newegg has the refurbished Ooma Telo home phone system for $89, shipped . The last time I wrote about it, it cost $16 more.\nThe Telo is a touch-operated, answering machine-style black box that plugs into your router. (You'll need broadband Internet service for this, natch.) You then plug your existing cordless-phone base unit into the Telo. Presto: you've got dial tone, same as if you were still using a POTS line .\nOnce you buy the hardware (which sells new for $149.99), you're looking at nearly free local and long-distance phone service -- forever. Your only bill will be for taxes and fees, which in my area come to around $3.50 per month.\nThat said, you might want to consider paying a little more. The included Ooma Basic service affords a handful of phone features : caller ID, voice mail, and so on. If you want extras like free calling to Canada, a second line, three-way calling, call forwarding (in the event of an Internet outage), and voice mail delivered via e-mail, you'll need Ooma Premier , which runs $9.99 per month.\nAlso, porting your existing number costs $39.99 -- unless you prepay for a year of Premier ($119.99), in which case it's free.\nSo, yeah, Ooma does nickel-and-dime you a bit, but most of the extras are optional. And if you're currently paying, say, $30 per month for basic landline service, that $120 for a full year of goodies is a great deal.\nAs for quality, I've been an Ooma user for nearly four years and couldn't be more satisfied. Even with the Telo installed \"behind\" my router (rather than in front, which is the recommended setup), call quality is much better than I ever got from Vonage. As for Ooma's customer service, I can't really comment because I've never had cause to use it. Everything just works.\nI realize lots of folks are abandoning their landlines altogether in favor of cell phones, but it's still a lot more convenient to have traditional cordless phones scattered around the house. Safer, too, as there's more likely to be a phone within reach in case of emergency. At just $90, this is hard to pass up.\nBonus deal: Game time! If you've never played the Crazy Machines series, do yourself a favor and head to Bundle Stars, where you can get a sweet Crazy Machines bundle (Win) for $3.99 . It includes three Crazy Machines games (which would normally cost you $40) and six expansion packs. In each game, your goal is to solve a puzzle by constructing, well, a crazy machine. (Think: Rube Goldberg.) Fun, challenging, and good for the brain!\nBonus deal No. 2: Whether you're editing spreadsheets, CAD drawings, or photos, detailed desktop work benefits greatly from a high-end monitor. And they don't get much higher than this: For a limited time, you can get the Dell P2815Q 28-inch Ultra HD monitor for $559.99, shipped (plus tax where applicable). Regular price: $699.99. The specs on this mammoth panel include 3,840x2,160 resolution (that's 4K to you and me), a rotating display (for landscape or portrait viewing), and a wealth of ports: HDMI/MHL, DisplayPort, and four USB 3.0. It also comes with a three-year warranty. Just make sure your video card supports 4K displays. And be sure to note the expected delivery time when you get to checkout; Dell is currently anticipating a few weeks owing to high demand.\nDeals found on The Cheapskate are subject to availability, expiration, and other terms determined by sellers.\nWant to know more about The Cheapskate blog and how it works?

The company — which only launched three months ago at our NewTeeVee Live conference — has been rewarded with an $11 million Series B round led by JAFCO Ventures and including previous investors Benchmark Capital and Redpoint Ventures.\nNow the mission is to attract Clicker users by the millions and score distribution deals to get to every screen. Clicker now has 750,000 monthly visitors to its site, and more through distribution on Boxee and other places, said CEO Jim Lanzone. That’s certainly respectable for a three-month-old site but a little low for a pre-revenue portal with $19 million in funding. Lanzone said he did the raise after significant interest from investors.\nAdvertisement\nClicker provides a very organized and nicely laid-out guide to legal venues for consuming content online. The idea is to save people the time and hassle of knowing where to find their favorite shows. “Our core asset is our database and the technologies to support, grow and maintain it,” said Lanzone. “It’s very agile, and can be deployed almost anywhere.”\nAdvertisement\nHowever, the company faces a ton of competition, including other startups like SideReel and CastTV , existing large sites like the original TV Guide , as well as Hulu — which now has everyone but CBS in terms of major content, and directs its searchers to shows it doesn’t have. TV Everywhere-type projects from cable companies and other MSOs could potentially be good partners for Clicker but are perhaps as concerned with limiting access to content as they are with providing it. One advantage of Clicker is that it indexes web originals much better than any of those services.\nAdvertisement\nLanzone said this week that he plans for Clicker’s revenue model to be lead generation rather than video or display advertising. What he means by that is he will invite content producers and subscription services to target potential viewers of their shows (for instance, a cooking show would buy space against other cooking content) or their versions of shows (for instance, Netflix would try to attract viewers to its subscription stream).\nAdvertisement\nRelated research from GigaOM Pro (sub. req’d):\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

CastTV indexes videos from thousands of sources on the web, and visitors use the company’s site to find clips and also to sift through lists of viral videos and TV episodes; the company also licenses its video search technology to third-parties.\nTribune Media Services provides entertainment-related metadata to many of its customers, which they use to power TV listings and guides, and the company says that it will use CastTV’s technology so that its customers can now create “entertainment-discovery guides that direct consumers to programs available on linear, on-demand and online video platforms.” It will also keep the CastTV site and operate it as part of its Zap2it entertainment site.\nAdvertisement\nAll of CastTV’s staff, including CEO Edwin Ong and president Alex Vikati, will now join Tribune Media Services. Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The four-year-old startup had raised $3.1 million in funding three-and-a-half years ago when it was still in stealth mode.

Dave Link\nCloud computing might be a threat to some of the biggest IT vendors around, but  it's turning other companies into the next Goliaths.\nTake ScienceLogic, for  example, a company founded 12 years ago by CEO David Link.\nScienceLogic's revenue under contract — aka  \"bookings\" — tripled from about $30 million in 2014 to $100  million in 2015, Link told Business Insider.\nAnd he expects big growth again in 2016, although he wouldn't  share the target number.\nThis is all because of enterprises running full-speed ahead  toward cloud-computing services, particularly Amazon Web Services  — the giant of the industry.\nScienceLogic offers what's known as systems and network  monitoring tools. It competes with products f rom  companies like Zenoss, Solarwinds, IBM, HP, and  CA.\nThe 'hybrid' market\nAbout three years ago, Link saw the cloud-computing trend  and revamped his product to work especially well with Amazon's  cloud. Today, it also works with Microsoft Azure and clouds built  using VMware's software, too.\nHis goal was to tackle what's known today as \"hybrid\"  computing. That's when companies put part of their IT into the  cloud while keeping part in their own data centers.\nMany businesses plan to operate in a  hybrid forever. Others find that once they try cloud  computing, they like it and want to eventually  unplug  all of their data centers . But they will still be  hybrid for a few years, the time it takes them to move.\nAs you might imagine, it can be complicated to manage a  hybrid setup, with apps, data, and systems spread out all over.  And this is especially true if a company uses more than one  cloud, which many do.\nScienceLogic helps them watch, and even find, all of  their IT assets.  Its claim to fame is that it's  incredibly detailed, Link tells us.\nA dot-com survivor\nScienceLogic is also a dream come true for  Link.\nBefore he founded ScienceLogic,  Link had been working for a web-hosting company  that didn't survive the dot-com bubble. It was his job to buy all  of the data-center equipment and systems-monitoring tools. He and  his two ScienceLogic cofounders — who  still run the company with him — spent  their first year programming the initial product in his  basement.\n\"I was a buyer of these products, and I didn't like the way  the marketplace was treating me,\" he told Business  Insider. \"We didn't build this company to build it and flip it.  We wanted to solve a problem near and dear to our hearts.\"\nThe company was bootstrapped for its first seven years before  landing its first $15 million in venture funding from NEA in  2010. It then landed Intel and Goldman Sachs as investors  and, all told, raised $84 million, with a $45 million  round from Goldman Sachs about a year ago, before the funding  bubble burst.\n\"We'll be cash-flow positive second half of this  year,\" he says. \"I'm so happy to be sitting here now, feeling  smarter than I should because we took more funding than we  needed.\"\nAn initial public offering is the eventual goal, he  concedes, but that will have to wait until the public market  regains its tech-IPO appetite again.\nIn the meantime, thanks in large part to Amazon,  business is good.\nIn addition to tripling bookings last year,  ScienceLogic will grow its employee base  from 270 to about 350 people in 2016, with offices  in Europe, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It has 25,000 customers  worldwide.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\n", "deleted" : false }

Fenton has previously backed several open-source startups, including Docker, Hortonworks, Hyperic, Terracotta, and Zimbra.\nThe deal puts the unusually named Cockroach Labs on the map as a database startup to watch, right up there with RethinkDB and more mature outfits like Basho , Couchbase , DataStax , and MongoDB .\nCockroach Labs’s CockroachDB is a distributed, transactional key-value store that keeps copies of data in multiple places consistent, ensuring that data is available when it’s needed. The database has some similarities to Google’s Spanner .\nCockroach Labs founders Ben Darnell, Spencer Kimball, and Peter Mattis, who previously worked at Google, explain why the database and the startup are named after an ugly bug in a blog post today:\nIf you can get past their grotesque outer aspect, you’ve got to give them credit for sheer resilience. You’ve heard the theory that cockroaches will be the only survivors post-apocalypse? Turns out modern database systems have a lot to gain by emulating one of nature’s oldest and most successful designs. Survive, replicate, proliferate. That’s been the cockroach model for geological ages, and it’s ours too. It doesn’t hurt that the name itself is resilient to being forgotten.\nNew York-based Cockroach Labs started earlier this year. Nine engineers work there now. Kimball expects the startup to have around 15-20 on staff by the end of the year.\n“We are going to be laser-focused on developer adoption and building the open source community,” Kimball told VentureBeat in an email.\nAside from Benchmark, Google Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and FirstMark Capital also participated in the round.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter &  Facebook\nPeter Fenton\n(from Benchmark's web site) Peter Fenton joined Benchmark Capital in 2006 after spending seven years as a partner with Accel Partners.

(NYSE: ASGN), a leading global provider of    diversified professional staffing solutions, today reported results for    the quarter ended June 30, 2015.\nSecond Quarter Highlights\nEffective June 5, 2015, acquired Creative Circle, LLC (\"Creative     Circle\"), one of the largest digital/creative staffing firms in North     America, for $570 million in cash and stock, plus contingent     consideration of up to $30 million.\nRevenues were $485.3 million; up 11.7 percent year-over-year (12.8     percent on a constant currency basis).\nRevenues, excluding the contribution from acquisitions, were $463.5     million ($468.1 million on a constant currency basis), up 6.7 percent     (7.8 percent on a constant currency basis) and above the high-end of     our financial estimates.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure defined below) was $56.0 million.     Adjusted EBITDA included $4.9 million from Creative Circle. Excluding     the contribution from Creative Circle, Adjusted EBITDA was $51.1     million and towards the high-end of our financial estimates.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure defined     below) was $32.3 million ($0.61 per diluted share). Excluding the     contribution from Creative Circle, Adjusted income from continuing     operations was $28.8 million ($0.55 per share) and was towards the     high-end of our financial estimates.\nIn conjunction with the Creative Circle acquisition, entered into a     new $975 million credit facility, comprised of an $825 million     seven-year term loan and a $150 million revolving credit facility.     After the closing of Creative Circle, $875 million was outstanding     under the facility.\nLeverage ratio (total indebtedness to trailing 12 months Adjusted     EBITDA) was 3.51 to 1 at June 30, 2015, up from 2.06 to 1 at December     31, 2014.\nCommenting on the results, Peter Dameris, President and Chief Executive    Officer of On Assignment, Inc., said, \"We are pleased with our strategic    and operational accomplishments during the quarter. The acquisition of    Creative Circle positions us well in the fast growing digital/creative    staffing space allowing us to engage the CMO along with the CIO to    provide solutions that meet the growing needs of both groups while    driving greater demand for our traditional services.\n\"Our financial performance for the quarter was enhanced by the    acquisition of Creative Circle, which was accretive on a GAAP and an    Adjusted Earnings basis. Excluding the contribution from Creative    Circle, our results (adjusted mainly for acquisition-related costs and    the write-off of loan costs associated with our old credit facility)    were at or above the high-end of our previously announced financial    estimates for the quarter. Our revenue growth rates were higher than    expected and reflected a slight re-acceleration in our growth rate for    the first time in four quarters. Our cash generation during the quarter    was strong and permitted us to pay down our indebtedness by $25 million    prior to the end of the quarter and we expect to voluntarily pay down an    additional $25 million by the end of July.\"\nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Results\nRevenues for the quarter were $485.3 million ($489.9 million on a    constant currency basis), up 11.7 percent (12.8 percent on a constant    currency basis) year-over-year. Constant currency revenues and growth    rates for the quarter were calculated using the foreign currency    exchange rates from the same period in the prior year.\nRevenues included $21.8 million from two businesses acquired during the    quarter (Creative Circle and a small Life Sciences business in Europe),    which are included in consolidated results from the date of acquisition.    The revenue contribution from Creative Circle was $19.6 million, and the    contribution from the Life Sciences business was $2.2 million. Revenues,    excluding the contribution from acquisitions, were $463.5 million    ($468.1 million on a constant currency basis), up 6.7 percent (7.8    percent on a constant currency basis) and above the high-end of our    financial estimates.\nOperating results of Creative Circle are included in the Apex Segment.    The Life Sciences European business is now included in the Oxford    Segment for reporting purposes. The operating and statistical data for    the Oxford Segment have been adjusted to reflect this change in    reporting.\nDirect hire and conversion revenues were $28.7 million, up 33.8 percent    year-over-year, which included $1.5 million from Creative Circle.    CyberCoders accounted for 72.6 percent of the total and was up 28.0    percent year-over-year. Direct hire and conversion revenues were 5.9    percent of total revenues for the quarter, up from 4.9 percent in the    second quarter of 2014.\nOur largest segment, Apex, accounted for 69.8 percent of total revenues.    Apex grew 13.7 percent year-over-year, on a reported basis, which    included $19.6 million in revenues from Creative Circle. Excluding the    contribution from Creative Circle, Apex grew 7.1 percent year-over-year    for the quarter.\nOur Oxford Segment accounted for 30.2 percent of total revenues. Oxford    grew 7.4 percent year-over-year on a reported basis, which included $2.2    million in revenues from an acquired business.

SG&A expenses for the    quarter included SG&A from Creative Circle of $4.0 million, acquisition,    integration and strategic planning expenses of $6.9 million, and $0.5    million related to the write-off of an IT application. Excluding these    expenses, SG&A expense was approximately $107.5 million and within our    previously announced financial estimates.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $7.0 million, compared with $5.5    million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in amortization    mainly related to the acquisition of Creative Circle.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $4.7 million compared with $3.1    million in the second quarter of 2014. Interest expense for the quarter    was comprised of interest on the credit facility of $4.2 million and    amortization of deferred loan costs of $0.5 million.\nWrite-off of loan costs totaled $3.8 million ($2.3 million, $0.04 per    diluted share, after tax) and related to the refinancing of the credit    facility in June.\nThe leverage ratio (total indebtedness to trailing 12 months Adjusted    EBITDA) at June 30, 2015 was 3.51 to 1, up from 2.06 to 1 at December    31, 2014. The increase in the leverage ratio related to borrowing to    fund the acquisition of Creative Circle.\nThe effective income tax rate for the quarter was 40.8 percent, a slight    decrease from the 41.2 percent for the full year 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure defined below) was $56.0 million.    The Adjusted EBITDA contribution from Creative Circle was $4.9 million.

Net income on a GAAP basis was $14.3 million ($0.27 per    diluted share). Net income included acquisition, integration and    strategic planning expenses of $6.9 million ($4.6 million after tax, or    $0.09 per diluted share), $0.5 million related to the write-off of an IT    application ($0.3 million after tax or $0.01 per diluted share) and the    write-off of deferred loan costs of $3.8 million ($2.3 million after tax    or $0.04 per diluted share).\nCreative Circle Acquisition\nOn June 5, 2015 the Company completed its acquisition of privately-held    Creative Circle, LLC for $570 million, and up to an additional $30    million based on operating performance during 2015. In connection with    the acquisition, the Company obtained a secured financing commitment for    $975 million from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

Such information is    provided as additional information, not as an alternative to our    consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally    Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), and is intended to enhance an overall understanding of our current financial    performance. The Supplemental Financial Information sets forth financial    measures reviewed by our management to evaluate our operating    performance. Such measures also are used to determine a portion of the    compensation for some of our executives and employees. We believe the    non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management,    investors and prospective investors by excluding certain charges and    other amounts that we believe are not indicative of our core operating    results. These non-GAAP measures are included to provide management, our    investors and prospective investors with an alternative method for    assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the    performance of our ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent    basis for comparison between quarters. One of the non-GAAP financial    measures presented is EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,    depreciation, and amortization of intangible assets), other terms    include Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus equity-based compensation expense,    impairment charges, write-off of loan costs, and acquisition,    integration and strategic planning expenses) and Non-GAAP income from    continuing operations (Income from continuing operations, plus write-off    of loan costs, and acquisition, integration and strategic planning    expenses, net of tax) and Adjusted income from continuing operations and    related per share amounts. These terms might not be calculated in the    same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled    measures reported by other companies. The financial statement tables    that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of each    non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP    financial measure.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements made in this news release are “forward-looking    statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange    Act of 1934, as amended, and involve a high degree of risk and    uncertainty. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the    Company's anticipated financial and operating performance in 2015. All    statements in this release, other than those setting forth strictly    historical information, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking    statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results    might differ materially. In particular, the Company makes no assurances    that the estimates of revenues, gross margin, SG&A, Adjusted EBITDA,    income from continuing operations, adjusted income from continuing    operations, earnings per share or earnings per diluted share set forth    above will be achieved. Factors that could cause or contribute to such    differences include actual demand for our services, our ability to    attract, train and retain qualified staffing consultants, our ability to    remain competitive in obtaining and retaining temporary staffing    clients, the availability of qualified temporary professionals,    management of our growth, continued performance of our enterprise-wide    information systems, our ability to manage our potential or actual    litigation matters, the successful integration of our recently acquired    subsidiaries, the successful implementation of our five-year strategic    plan, and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed    with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including our    Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as    filed with the SEC on March 2, 2015, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q    for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC on May 8,    2015, and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 5,    2015.

All 436 questions. Only one other (top 20) dating site makes all new members take a personality profile -  PerfectMatch . Here's my interview with Duane Dahl, the CEO. I also interviewed Duane in June 2005 . - Mark Brooks\nI was floored when I saw Dr. Phil with Perfectmatch .\nLast year after Perfectmatch was featured on Dr. Phil, it gave us a unique opportunity to develop our relationship with the Dr. Phil people, and spend some time getting to know them. We were interested in pursuing a partnership arrangement, however, at the end of the day, it didn’t pencil out. Eventually, the Match folks constructed a lucrative deal for him – I’m not sure how that’s penciling out for them at this point.\nWhat new TV and movie placements do you have in the works?\nWe’re always looking for significant seamless integration in TV and film. It’s an ongoing process. We’re in development on a prime time series we’re very excited about. On the film side, we have a couple of projects, one late summer, and one in the fall that we’ll be announcing shortly. Additionally, we’ve got some ideas for 2007 regarding developing creative partnerships. We had great success with Whirlpool in 2006, with a series of events. Currently, we’re working with the Case Foundation (Steve and Jean Case) participating in a “Get Engaged” volunteer program we’re promoting in February.\nWhy do you like these placements better then Internet advertising?\nI wouldn’t say we like them better. We certainly think there’s a significant value in performance-based online partnerships and well placed online media. Add that to the search mix, our keyword business with the Google folks and Overture, and we like the blend online. It’s an important part of our business.\nWhen we first started looking at television opportunities, we were really trying to be creative and gain as many impressions as possible. We were on a very limited budget, as we were rolling out the site. And, as we experienced with the Lifetime original movie “Perfect Romance” and then the Warner Bros. summer hit, “Must Love Dogs”, the right opportunities with seamless integration can be fantastic. The key with the entertainment integration opportunities is just to be selective and make sure there’s a perfect match.  We feel fortunate we’ve had some great studio partners and noted success.\nHave you searched out any newspaper deals?\nNo, that hasn’t been our focus. We’ve really focused on larger scale online partners, keywords and now television. \neHarmony said it would never offer instant messaging a while back. Would Perfectmatch ever offer IM?We currently don’t offer instant messaging, but I would never, say never. It’s evaluated on an ongoing basis. We’ve found our membership has embraced the communication system currently in place. We routinely survey our membership to ensure we’re meeting their needs and we continue to provide the best approach to finding a mate online. Our search feature, which of course eHarmony hasn’t cracked, and our communication tools are constantly reviewed.\nHow about voice and video communications?\nI think video is very difficult at this stage. We’ve seen a few people attempt to launch video. Live video gravitates towards sexually explicit material. This medium is something geared for those who’re interested in a quick hook up, and more deviant behavior seems to gravitate towards live video. I would expect to see video more on the younger skewing down-market dating sites rather than the more credible 25+ sites where the members are looking for relationships. There’re a lot of issues with video that are challenging to the consumer. Also, if you’re allowing an individual to upload video, it’s incumbent upon the community to review every second of the video content before approving it onto the site, as people (shockingly enough!) will upload videos that contain inappropriate content. There’s nothing worse on a dating/relationship site to not know what is behind door #3 and being presented with an inappropriate image, video or an email from a spammer. As the Internet and media evolves, we’ll see an appropriate integration. However, I do think it’s going to take some time.\nDo you think voice connections can be successful through Internet dating sites?\nI think with today’s technology, the ability to simply connect with an individual through voice is something that does have value. It’s only a matter of making it as seamless as possible. We looked at a secure phone service back in 2001. One of the challenges was requiring individuals who had already gone through the sign up process, to go and create completely new accounts. It just needed seamlessly integrating onto one platform. We’ve come a long way here over the past five years, and I think as time goes on, we’ll see more and more people successfully integrating the voice technology that’s available.\nHow else is Perfectmatch clearly differentiated from eHarmony ?\nMost online daters haven’t been satisfied in the past. By the time the member comes to Perfectmatch, we recognize they’re serious about finding a relationship. Our approach is significantly different as we offer both highly compatible matches provided AND comprehensive search capabilities. We’re a step above eHarmony with our in-depth member profiles AND our member services team, the most experienced team in the space. This team works behind the scenes proactively dedicating themselves to ensuring the best possible user experience, from log-on though log-out.\nOur members leverage the real world experience and expertise of Dr. Pepper Schwartz and benefit from our matching system, Duet®, allowing us to take into account the “whole” member, a 360◦ view of the member, helping us to find a highly compatible match.  We believe the black box approach eHarmony has taken is difficult. However, give them credit – they’ve done a great job ramping up their business through a very aggressive TV spend. We expect to see them loosening the reigns a bit in 2007/2008, continuing to move away from its Christian origins, as they attempt to become more mainstream and more efficient with their member acquisition strategies.\nAt the end of the day, when faced with the offerings of Perfectmatch vs. eHarmony, we’ve seen members believe we have the best approach to finding real love online.\nWhat are your goals for the year?\nYou’ll find us working offline more aggressively – both television and radio. We think there continues to be an excellent opportunity with television. In fact, we’re rolling out a new spot within the next two weeks. Online, we’ll continue to work to become more efficient with search, and we look to expand our relationship with our existing partners MSNBC, iVillage and Oxygen, while solidifying a couple of other key performance based partnerships.\nFeb 16, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

This may seem somewhat surprising considering that it was only a year ago that the Justice Department seized the domain names of some of the country’s largest online poker platforms, like PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, UB.com, and Absolute Poker, charging their founders with bank fraud, money laundering, illegal gambling, among other offenses. And five years prior, the Unlawful Gambling Act effectively putting a stop to online gambling in the U.S. and sending the market into a tailspin.\nHowever, in December, the Justice Department reversed its stance on many forms of online gambling, paving the way for what is becoming a revitalization of the social gambling market. Naturally, with activity in the space increasing, a number of startups have popped up to take advantage, like the rebranded Titan Gaming , for example.\nToday brings another entrant into the social gambling space with RocketFrog , which is setting out to bring casino entertainment to Facebook with the launch of a free-to-play online casino that offers players the chance to win real prizes. Traditionally, online casino players participate in the casino gaming experience recreationally, with the rewards being the opportunity to socialize with friends or earn a few virtual badges.\nSo, RocketFrog wants to change this by leveraging the Facebook platform — where all of your friends are already — to create social tournaments, where players can interact and compete against their friends to win real prizes, not just accumulate points on leaderboards or vie for status increases.\nEach day, the startup will run poker, blackjack, and slot tournaments in small-ish fields of 80 to 300 players, with levels lasting two to five minutes. In a somewhat unusual business model, RocketFrog plans to recruit a different advertiser each day to sponsor a variety of prizes, including movie tickets, music, and good, with prizes obviously being related to whatever company happens to be paying for the ads. If it’s Pizza Hut, prizes will likely include coupons, meal offers, and probably some free pepperoni.\nThe platform intends to accomodate gamers of all abilities, so that if a user is new to a game, for example, they can peruse through the startup’s suite of learning tutorials, game strategy articles, and expert tips. Its games also allow players to choose their stakes and limits in an effort to customize the overall gaming experience, while challenging friends, tracking their bank roll, sharing achievements, earning loyalty rewards, and comparing game stats and rankings.\nRocketFrog was founded in 2010 by Brett Calapp, Matthew Osborn, and Uri Kozai. Calapp is the former CEO and co-founder of Centaurus Games, a subscription-based gaming network that sold to PartyGaming in 2010.\nThe startup’s leadership, along with the potential market opportunity, has attracted a familiar face in social networking. Tom Anderson, also known as the co-founder and former president of Myspace, has joined RocketFrog’s advisory board alongside reality TV star and celebrity poker player Brody Jenner.\nWhen asked what he sees as RocketFrog’s core value proposition, the former Myspace president said that few have “really pushed incentive-based gaming on the Facebook platform.” It’s as simple as the fact that millions of people play online poker for free, he says, so if they’re given an engaging platform and gaming experience, why wouldn’t they want to play for realworld prizes? What’s more, “RocketFrog is also giving advertisers what they always want but can’t seem to get — an immersive and deep experience that actually features their brand — banners alone aren’t enough.”\nCEO Brett Calapp says that, while legislation and regulations will take time to iron themselves out (legislation may not be put in place until next year, or 2014) and casino platforms are popping up by the minute, RocketFrog’s core strategy is to avoid making players feel inferior about their bankroll in order to drive sales of virtual currency, but instead to reward its players by offering them the ability to compete in tournaments for quality, realworld prizes.\nRather than relying on a small, obsessive segment of addicted players, Calapp says that RocketFrog wants to expand its community to include new players, those not typically classified as gamblers, but who don’t want to just play for meaningless virtual rewards.\nRocketFrog has a steep uphill climb to track down the bigs in the space, like DoubleDown Casinos and Zynga’s Texas Hold ‘em, but with some influential advisors and a mission to bring social, tournament-style gamble-gaming to the masses, the startup may just be onto something.\n", "deleted" : false }

O'Brien obliged.\n\"We will be rolling support contracts out in the coming quarter as well. The immediate release was a step function, from OpenProj to Project on Demand.

As Projity CEO Marc O'Brien recently told Linux.com's Tina Gasperson , 500,000 individuals have downloaded OpenProj to date.\nPerhaps most intriguing in all of this is that Projity knows which companies have downloaded and installed its software, since it can't get that information from Sourceforge, from which individuals download the software. (It could, of course, be the case that each of the companies noted above is a paying customer, but since several of these are unlikely to serve as public references....) I'm guessing that Projity has some sort of a \"call home\" feature in its project, or perhaps a simple web bug that registers with Projity each time a page is refreshed.\nIf the latter, it becomes doubly interesting when you consider Projity's license: CPAL . In this case, CPAL might prohibit users from removing the very web bug that Projity uses to track their use of the software.\nMarc or someone else care to comment on how the tracking is managed? I'm sure a range of open-source companies would love to learn who is using their software, provided it doesn't abrogate a user's control of their privacy.\nUPDATE: Marc O'Brien, CEO of Projity, emailed me to clarify the privacy issues I raised above:\nI was disappointed you choose to raise issues that are erroneous and really counter productive for the open source success of OpenProj. ALL companies mentioned and all companies that we know are using OpenProj and Project-ON-Demand have provided us with their contact information. We do not know of ANY company using OpenProj or Project-ON-Demand who has not proactively given us their contact information.\nThanks for the clarification, Marc, and congratulations on getting these exceptional customers. That says a great deal about the quality of the software.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

While most of the industry is attracting people for love, marriage and romance, OBC promises a booty call. The message is refreshing for many who frequent OBC, it's to the point, and fun. Moses announced 10 commandments of dating back in January. I. Thou shalt get out before the sun rises, II. Thou shouldest never ask \"can we see each other from now on?\", III. Thou shalt refrain from referring to our activities as \"love making.\"  You get the picture. OBC is doing rather well, and was #13 on the Hitwise internet dating rankings for July . Here's my interview with Mo. - Mark Brooks\nWhat is OnlineBootyCall’s founding story?\nOBC’s founding story didn’t involve any market research or strategy. It was just a project I was doing while I was an engineer. Then, the dot.com disaster struck and I found myself without a job. So, around October of 2002, I turned my project into a business.\nI think the name alone generated attention. I was the first member and, of course, told all my friends about it and from there word just got around. I don’t think people had ever seen something like it before. We introduced a referral program and the concept just continued to grow from there. It’s a kind of grassroots story.\nWhen did you start charging?\nOn day one. I had heard stories that you had to reach a critical mass to get members to the point of wanting to upgrade. But after only about 40 members, I got my first conversion. Back then, the pricing was a little different. Not much more actually then it is now, but it was like $7.95 a month.\nHow would you say OBC is different from other dating sites?\nIt’s different in the approach. We approach dating in a light-hearted fashion. Obviously, the name implies more of a stage-one service for people who are just entering the dating scene. The culture on OBC also is a little different from most mainstream sites. We have more of an urban, hip-hop crowd. We embrace that, we like it, we like being different. I’m sure some of our users are on other dating sites, but we attract 18-24 year olds and I think for a lot of them OnlineBootyCall is their introduction to dating.\nHow many marriages have you had so far?\nA grand total of one. In October 2006, we reached one million members and had only one confirmed marriage then. I’m proud to say that our members are following our Booty Call commandments. It’s not like we discourage people from getting married. It’s just that most of the people on OBC are in a place in their lives where they’re not ready to get married, but still want to meet others. I had someone ask me, “You have one confirmed marriage, but how many divorces have you caused?”\nHow do you handle scamming?\nScamming is a tough one. I think the kind of scammers we’re getting range from people who want to peddle prostitution to Nigerian scammers. We’re pretty much experiencing what I think the rest of the industry is experiencing. Unfortunately, as you become more popular on the Internet, you’re naturally going to become more of a target for people, like hackers and scammers, who want to harm your site. I don’t know if the percentage of scammers has increased, but there definitely are more people making attempts and we’re consequently stepping up our efforts to stop them.\nWe were actually introduced to a new product (I think it’s by Iovation ) that actually produces a fingerprint for every user who visits your site. We did a test run and were able to track down people who were creating multiple accounts and joining for the wrong reasons. So, it’s been pretty effective actually. We also have a sniffer program in place. Every profile that is created is reviewed. We have a support team that takes action when a report is flagged from inside a message a member receives. Finally, we try to educate our members about what to look for as far as scamming goes. We all have to share our information. The only way the online dating and social networking industries can beat the scammers is by sharing.\nHave you considered offering a mobile OBC?\nYeah, we’re very interested in that. We were about to launch mobile a couple of months ago and got interrupted by another project. I just got back from a mobile social networking conference (the best one so far) and was just taking a look at which approach would be the best one for OBC.\nWhere do you see OBC in a year and a half?\nWe hope to reach a broader audience and also grow considerably internationally. We reach users in the U.K., Canada, and Australia, but haven’t really spent time developing those contacts yet. That’s our next focus. That’s where we see the next wave of growth.\nAug 25, 2007 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

Lollipop) and will power three new Nexus devices — the Motorola-made Nexus 6 phablet, the HTC-built Nexus 9 tablet and the Asus-built Nexus Player, a $99 set-top box.\nThe software itself is a major update for Google, which designed the operating system to power not only phones and tablets, but also televisions, watches and in-car entertainment systems.\nGoogle\n“It’s a big deal, and I think the team is pretty excited and pretty exhausted,” Hiroshi Lockheimer, VP of engineering, said in an interview on Tuesday.\nOn the hardware front, Google spread the wealth, working with three different chipset providers and three different hardware makers for the latest crop of Nexus devices.\nThe six-inch Nexus phone, which looks and feels a lot like a bigger Moto X, will be available in mid-November. Unlike many past Nexus phones, the Nexus 6 will be available not just from Google, but also directly from carriers, using either two-year contracts or device financing. On the downside, the device is pricier than any prior Nexus phone, starting at $649 without a contract.\nIt does pack high-end features, including its six-inch AMOLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chip, 13-megapixel camera and the ability to get six hours of use from a 15-minute charge.\nLockheimer said the pricier Nexus phone came, in part, due to requests from Android enthusiasts.\n“People wanted something a little more premium,” Lockheimer said. However, he noted, Lollipop will also run on the roughly $100 emerging-market devices that are part of Google’s Android One project.\nThe nine-inch tablet, which will start at $399, is the first 64-bit portable device running Android and also features Nvidia’s K1 processor, while the Nexus Player set-top box is the first Nexus with an Intel chip.\nThe tablet also uses a 4-by-3, rather than 16-by-9, aspect ratio. That was, in part, to highlight the fact it is useful for more than just watching movies, Lockheimer said. Google plans to sell a Nexus 9 case that doubles as a Bluetooth keyboard. The base model comes with 16 gigabytes of memory and is Wi-Fi only. Additional options include a 32GB Wi-Fi model and a 32GB model with LTE and Wi-Fi capabilities.\nGoogle’s $99 Nexus Player, seen here with optional game controller\nGoogle\nAs for the Nexus Player, it is Google’s latest effort to push Android into the TV market, having had limited success with past efforts. This year’s set-top box supports all the functions of Google’s Chromecast and runs Android apps as well. It comes with a remote that can also process voice input, with a full-on game controller sold as a $39 add-on.\nThe tablet and set-top box will both be available Nov. 3, Google said.\nLockheimer noted that Lollipop packs 5,000 new developer hooks, including new features for business users, along with a “material design” user interface intended to carry a common look across devices as disparate as cars, TVs and watches, along with the core Android market — phones and tablets.\nAmong the other features of Lollipop, Google is supporting a “kill switch” to make stolen phones unusable through what it is calling “Factory Reset Protection.” Essentially, it requires a password before a phone can be reset, ideally preventing thieves from making use of stolen phones.\nAlso on the security front, Google is turning on encryption by default, and Lollipop is the first version with support for separate user profiles on phones, making it easier for parents to hand off their devices to their kids. (Android already supported multiple users for tablets.) Google is also building in support for businesses that want to separate work and personal data.\nAnother key feature, Lockheimer said, is the ability to get information at a glance. That’s critical on watches, but also quite useful on phones. The Nexus 6, for example, has notifications that pulse even when the phone is in standby, in much the same way Motorola has already done on its own with Moto X.\nAnd never one to be satisfied with its latest dessert, Lockheimer said Google is already scoping out what to do next. “We’re already thinking about M, planning a bunch of stuff,” he said.\nrecode_divider\n", "deleted" : false }

Their average age is early twenties whereas our demographic is more late 20's. \nWhere are most of your members?\nL.A. and San Francisco followed by NY and pockets of Seattle, Houston, Chicago, Atlanta and Vancouver.  All in line with US census.  Asians represent 4% of the U.S. population which is roughly 12 million.\nHow did the Asian internet dating convention go?\nIt went well, Marc did a great job.  We got to network and learn a lot about the Asian market.  It opened my eyes in terms of what they are doing in China.  Especially the mobile and seeing how much further advanced beyond the USA they are.  It's a huge market with a lot of upside but it has it's share of challenges; namely pricepoint and payment procurement.  You can have tens of thousands of subscribers but may only get $4-$7 a month.  Also, payment can be up to 3-6 months delayed.  For example, with China telecom, we could be waiting 3-6 months for payment.  Online dating in Asia is huge but it shouldn't be treated as homogeneous market.  Korea, Phillipines, China, Singapore, Vietnam, all need to be treated very differently.  Finally, the advancement of the mobile technology is way ahead of North America; texting, paging, use of mobile devices and how they pay with mobile. \nHow much are they willing to pay?\nIn China people are willing to pay 20-25% of the U.S. online personals memberships; $4-$7 a month.  However, for events, we should be able to get 50% of the U.S. market rate.  There's definitely a group of people who will pay a higher price point at events, there's a finite number of tickets, but it's better to be less expensive with online dating to maintain critical mass. \nHow about the presentation on the Indian market?\nThe presentation on the Indian market opened my eyes.  They don't typically date.  They are more interested in marriage.  It's a totally different approach. \nWhat does the future hold for Click2Asia?\nWe're looking at Asia and expanding our network within North America.  When you look at the Jewish market, Jews in North America represent half of the Asian market.  So you can see the ethnic online dating market has huge potential.  We want to make inroads on the kinds of numbers Jdate are doing.  Jdate is a good comparison for our future potential. \nMay 27, 2005 | Permalink\n", "deleted" : false }

He later clarified his statement — a little — in another Tweet.\nhttps://twitter.com/dotMudge/status/615654277953007619\nZatko didn’t immediately return messages seeking further comment but sources familiar with this plans say he’s looking at setting up an independent non-profit organization devoted to software security that may in time get some government funding. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed that he’s talked to administration officials about the idea, but described those conversations as exploratory in nature.\nStill in mentioning a CyberUL, Zatko referred to a body that many security pros have wished existed for nearly two decades, one inspired in by Underwriters Laboratories , the 111-year-old company that tests products of all kinds for safety, but dedicated to cyber security.\nAn Obama Administration official tells Re/code that recent advances in using automated methods to analyze software code for vulnerabilities have spurred interest in government circles to see if there’s a way to standardize how software is tested for security and safety. “The Administration has had some discussions about the potential pros and cons of such a system and how it might be implemented,” the official said. The administration is interested supporting a feasibility study to determine if such techniques could work, the official said, but stressed that no plans have been finalized.\nA former researcher with DARPA, the research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense, he joined Google along with fellow DARPA alum Regina Dugan  to work on security research at the search giant’s Advanced Technologies and Projects Group .\nThe idea for a CyberUL was first proposed in 1999 by L0pht Heavy Industries, a hacker think tank based in Cambridge, Mass., of which Zatko was a member.\nWhen L0pht first proposed the idea, the sudden popularity of the Internet both among consumers and businesses was putting public safety at risk. Security software isn’t always as good as its creators claim. “The lack of standards and meaningful certification has allowed the sale of products that are either intentionally or unintentionally snake-oil,” the group argued at the time.\nUnderwriters Laboratories is an apt inspiration if you compare the growth of the Internet to that of electricity. When it began operations in 1894, UL’s primary focus was on researching and establishing fire and electrical safety standards. Today, the distinctive circled “UL” mark appears on more than 22 billion individual items; the firm has evaluated more than 97,000 products and operates in 113 countries.\n“Just as in the late 1800s, the consumers have little understanding of the inventions they are purchasing,” the L0pht proposal reads. “They are presented with claims by the product’s marketers and have no way of proving those claims to be true or false. Just as it was back then, this has not stopped the large-scale application of these inventions, regardless of public safety.”\nZatko seems to be a logical person to lead such an effort. In the mid-1990s, he published some of the first papers on a type of computer security vulnerability known as a buffer overflow . Later, he was the principal creator of some important security tools, including L0phtcrack , a widely-used password-auditing program. In 1998, he and other members of L0pht testified before the U.S. Senate , famously claiming that the group could, with its combined expertise and capabilities, “bring down the Internet in about 30 minutes.” \nThe following year, the group went legit and joined up with the Cambridge-based computer security firm @Stake, which in 2004 became part of Symantec. In 2005, Zatko joined BBN Technologies as a research scientist.\nIn 2010, he joined DARPA as a program manager in its Strategic Technologies Office, where he oversaw research intended to help government agencies fend off cyber attacks. Inside DARPA, an agency known for its secrecy and, occasionally, for the cool things it does, Zatko created a Cyber Fast Track Program, through which hackers and security researchers who work outside government agencies could obtain funding for projects to help improve the security of military systems.\nCorrection: We initially said that Zatko was slated to up a new government agency focused on software security.\nrecode_divider\n", "deleted" : false }

That’s the assessment of one unnamed banker, who notes that the list of available large independent agencies (or agencies that bring in more than $10 million to 15 million annually) that are amenable to a buyout continues to shrink. And within that group, the banker tells AdAge that “every other broker and PE firm has called all 10 of those guys at least three times.” Attempting to zero in on the number of possible investors out there, AdAge further estimates that there are around 40 PE firms targeting digital ad shops, spurred on by the major payout investors like Hellman & Friedman stand to make for arranging the pending $3.1 billion acquisition of DoubleClick.\nIn pursuing deals with interactive ad shops, some PE firms are fashioning a business model that resembles “a mini-holding company.” One example of this approach is found in General Atlantic’s February purchase of a majority stake in San Francisco digital ad agency AKQA. In seeking to build mini-holding company, AKQA bought search-marketer SearchRev in August.\nAdvertisement\nThat purchase of a search-marketing company also points toward the direction PE investments will likely take, as more general interactive ad shops like Blast Radius get snapped up by the likes of ad agency holding companies like WPP Group, which have increasingly challenged PE firms in seeking out acquisition targets in the digital ad space. So as the past year’s purchases have tended to focus on general online ad agencies or networks, at least one banker specializing in these deals, Michael Seidler, CEO of Madison Alley Global Ventures, sees the next wave of purchases washing over niche-service providers offering search, e-mail, widgets, desktop and mobile applications and analytics services. There’s possibilities seen at the other end of that spectrum as well, with with investors willing to target offline ad companies that have some degree of digital disciplines within.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

The closing of the two hubs was reported in an Aug. 19 story by VentureBeat.  \nGoogle Express later expanded into San Jose, then into Santa Monica and Los Angeles in southern California as the company worked to find places where it could better compete with Amazon's delivery strengths, according to earlier eWEEK reports.\nGoogle declined to comment in response to an eWEEK inquiry about the reported shuttering of the two delivery hubs.\nThe company reportedly is not giving up on its Google Express services but is moving away from hub-based delivery operations as part of a new business strategy, according to a spokesperson.\nSeveral key executives from Google Express left the company over the last year, including Tom Fallows, the original product management director for the business.\nWhen Google expanded Google Express into Santa Monica in January 2014, it was only made available to company employees and a select group of local applicants as a trial project. The Santa Monica pilot followed the original pilot that launched in March 2013 in San Francisco.\nIn San Francisco, the program began with same-day local deliveries for online orders from national chain stores such as Target, Walgreens, Staples, American Eagle and Toys 'R Us/Babies 'R Us, as well as smaller local retailers like San Francisco's Blue Bottle Coffee, the Bay Area's Palo Alto Toy & Sport and Raley's Nob Hill Foods. Later, additional retailers joined the service, including DODOcase, Guitar Center, L'Occitane, REI and Whole Foods.\nWhen Google launched the San Francisco program, it also debuted new Google Shopping Express mobile apps for both Android and iOS so that customers could make their purchases and receive product deliveries even when they are away from their homes or offices. To use the service, shoppers can browse the Websites of participating stores, make their item selections, provide personalized delivery instructions for the third-party couriers who will bring their packages, and get their items delivered on the same day.\nThe Santa Monica pilot program offered deliveries for $4.95 from each retailer after the free six-month trial period.\nIn the San Francisco service area, product prices for the items ordered and delivered through the service are the same as prices that consumers find in their local stores, according to Google. Shoppers can also add their retailer loyalty program numbers at checkout to take advantage of member prices. Deliveries can be scheduled from early mornings until 9 p.m.\nGoogle certainly has been experimenting with e-commerce for a long time, with its Google Payments, Google Wallet and Google Checkout products. In February 2013, Google bolstered its online sales capabilities by acquiring Channel Intelligence, which lets consumers buy products directly through product pages on Websites. One of the company's products, its Buy Now app, shows potential buyers a dynamically updated list of online retailers that have an advertised product in stock, where the consumer can purchase the item instantly with a click.\nNot all of those efforts have been successful, however. In November 2013, Google ended its Google Checkout service. After being created in 2006, Checkout allowed customers to make purchases of services or physical goods from online vendors, but it apparently outlived its usefulness for the search giant because of a lack of satisfactory demand. Instead, Google began expanding its related Google Wallet payment services.\nSame-day delivery service certainly isn't an invention of Google. In October 2009, Amazon launched same-day delivery services in seven major U.S. cities as it expanded its buying options for its customers.\nThis is not the first time that Google has dabbled with the idea of same-day delivery. The idea has at least been in discussions since late 2011, when the company began its Google Product Search service.\n \n", "deleted" : false }

Adding Zipwire into Tripudio Telecom’s portfolio enables the    VAR to offer its retail, travel, transport and technology clients the    market-leading customer engagement capabilities that they are demanding,    on a pay-as-you-use basis.\nThe VAR is the latest to join Aspect’s cloud partner program in Europe,    which is designed to accelerate the speed at which providers operating    within the contact center space can move to cloud. Tripudio Telecom will    initially focus on rolling out Zipwire to its customers, with the    potential to then add mobile self-service, followed by workforce    optimization and back office optimization as customers expand their    cloud-based contact centers.\nJonathan Collard, Commercial Director at Tripudio Telecom commented: “We    collaborate with our customers, employing a pragmatic but agile and    commercially flexible approach. Deploying packaged services that are    aligned with our clients’ needs enables us to deliver customized    solutions that are shaped around their appetite for change, internal    skills, existing back office processes and available resources. By    working in this way, Tripudio Telecom has secured partnerships with    several well-known customer-centric brands in Europe and worldwide.    Zipwire not only significantly enhances the capability of our existing    core telephony platform for contact centers, but also complements our    flexible approach to solution definition, which is essential for us when    choosing a vendor partner.”\nKate Tustin, Northern Europe Channel Sales Manager at Aspect, added:    “The aim of our channel recruitment drive is to find specialized    partners that want to make the transition to cloud provision, but with    the full support and expertise from a vendor like Aspect that will ease    some of the challenges. Tripudio Telecom is a prototypical example of an    Aspect cloud partner in that is expert in its chosen vertical markets,    but wants to innovate and enhance the customer offering via the cloud.    In addition, they give us greater coverage in the travel and retail    sectors, and fit our route-to-market strategy targeting mid-market    enterprises in Northern Europe.”\nTustin concluded: “With quite an ambitious but competitive strategy for    innovation, I’m expecting big things from the Aspect-Tripudio    relationship that will open up new avenues for both companies.\"\nAbout Tripudio Telecom\nTripudio straddles the space vacated by the large, impersonal and    inwardly focused domestic PTT’s and OLO providers by giving high    quality, responsive and tailored international solutions at cost    effective price points. Tripudio’s near unique international knowledge    base, combines with speedy service deployment of inbound call    collection, call segmentation, network queuing, PCI-DSS payments and    IP-Telephony solutions.\nAbout Aspect\nAspect’s fully-integrated solution unifies the three most important    facets of modern consumer engagement strategy:  customer    interaction management ,  workforce    optimization , and  back-office.  Through    a full suite of cloud,  hosted    and hybrid deployment  options, we help the world’s most demanding    contact centers and back offices seamlessly align their people,    processes and touch points to deliver remarkable customer experiences.

Part of the way it does that is via small acquisitions — some of which stay under the radar for years.\nTechCrunch has learned that Apple quietly bought a startup called Ottocat  some time ago, which had developed a system to organize and surface apps on the app store based on “nested” categories of increasing specificity. A version of that system now powers the “explore” tab in Apple’s App Store.\nThere is precious little evidence of the connection between Ottocat and Apple — no LinkedIn employment changes, no announcements to Ottocat users — save for one thing. One of Ottocat’s co-founders, Edwin Cooper, authored a patent that was  granted to Apple as the original assignee . It looks like that patent was filed by Cooper as an employee of Apple . That patent, for a “System and Method for Divisive Textual Clustering by Label Selection Using Variant-Weighted TFIDF,” pertains to the kind of technology used both by Ottocat and Apple’s explore feature.\nThe acquisition looks like it may have happened some time in 2013. It was in October of that year that Ottocat’s website went down with the short message: “Ottocat is no longer available.” Now, pointing your browser to Ottocat’s URL gives you a blank page. Ottocat had a very short life: it only opened its beta to the public in May 2013  after developing a working prototype in January 2013.\nThe timing of Ottocat going dark in late 2013 links up with Apple announcing “explore” in the App Store in mid-2014, part of a series of updates made public during the WWDC that year to improve how apps can be discovered in the increasingly large and unwieldy App Store catalog.\nSo what was Ottocat?\nWe never covered Ottocat in its brief life ( others did ), but in a nutshell, its technology essentially addressed pain points on both sides of the App Store: for users unable to find specific enough results for subject-based app searches when they don’t have a specific app in mind; and for developers unhappy with how well their apps could be discovered among a sea of 1 million+ other apps.\nThe premise was to do away with keywords by categorizing apps into increasingly more specific subcategories that worked on a “drill-down” principle — eliminating the guesswork and potential inaccuracy of keywords altogether.\nOr, as Cooper’s patent describes it:\nIn a world where billions of digitized documents exist, technologies that make large sets of documents more tractable are in significant demand. One such area of technology is the search engine. By submitting a query, a user may restrict the set of available documents to those most relevant to the query. Another such technological area is that of document clustering; by automatically creating groups (clusters’) within a large set of documents, that large set of documents can be divided into consumable parts, and thereby made tractable to a given user or set of users. Given a hierarchy of document clusters, each with a descriptive label, a user may browse quickly to those subject areas of greatest interest, and may further refine the chosen subject area through choosing an appropriate subcategory. Assuming that the clustering technique is applied recursively until no more that a pre-specified number of documents exist in a cluster, the user may browse document to an arbitrary degree of specificity in terms of clustered subject area.\nFor example, rather than searching on “guitar” or scrolling through the full selection of music apps that the term might call up, or the chart for the most popular music apps — which can contain streaming apps, apps that are designed to work with specific hardware, apps that let people use their phones to play music, apps that teach them how to play a specific instrument, and so on — you can start to look at specific subcategories to find a selection of apps you may want to download.\nThis is what such a search looked like for interactive children’s books:\nFor those of you who use the “explore” feature on the App Store, the basic idea of how all this works will sound familiar.\nOttocat, which claimed to index the entirety of the App Store in this way, also included extra details such as the average star ratings, how popular the app has been, and when it was last updated.\nOttocat was co-founded by Edwin Cooper and Michelle Cooper, both repeat entrepreneurs, in 2012. Michelle holds a PhD in molecular biology and has extensive experience in marketing and fundraising.\nEdwin is a computer scientist who once noted on his LinkedIn profile that he is interested in, among other things, data science, natural language processing, machine learning, mobile devices, “and the fallout from Big Data.”\nWe are not sure if said Coopers are at Apple now. If they are, it’s enticing to wonder what they might be working on, given the bigger decisions Apple may be making around search in other products like Safari and its mobile and desktop operating systems.\nWhile  Yahoo and Microsoft are reportedly duking it out to take over Google’s place as the default search in Apple’s Safari browser in the U.S., we’ve heard that it might be just as likely that Apple might try to bring more of search tech in-house. This would be in keeping with the massive effort that Apple is putting in to making other services like maps into a native experience. It would also play directly into the kind of expertise Edwin Cooper has amassed.\nInterestingly, this would not be Edwin Cooper’s first bite of Apple. In 2011, he  sold a previous startup he founded to Oracle . That company, InQuira, developed a CRM platform for third parties to offer self-help to its users. By coincidence, the search feature on Apple’s support site is one of the services powered by InQuira’s technology.\nWe have reached out to Apple and Ottocat’s co-founders for comment and more detail. We will update as we learn more.\nFeatured Image: Loco Steve / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\n0\n", "deleted" : false }

And today, Scrapblog, a startup that lets you build rich Flash-based online scrapbooks is being acquired by competitor Mixbook. Terms of the deal are not disclosed.\nThis actually a positive exit for a company that seemed to be in trouble.

Blekko’s home page message gives the impression of a complete acquisition, but IBM’s post mentions the acquisition of “certain technology.”\nIn our work to enhance the performance of cognitive computing systems, we’re constantly exploring new ways to identify, understand and make use of information from both public and private sources. Toward this end, we are excited about the acquisition of certain technology from Blekko, Inc, which closed this afternoon. This will provide access to additional content that can be infused in Watson-based products and services delivered by IBM and its partners.\nWe’ve reached out to Blekko CEO Rich Skrenta (who tweeted the news ) for clarification on what IBM is acquiring, and we’ll update this if we learn more.\nBlekko came out of stealth in 2008 with Skrenta promising to create a search engine with “algorithmic editorial differentiation” compared to Google. Its public search engine finally opened in 2010 , launching with what the site called “slashtags” — a personalization and filtering tool that gave users control over the sites they saw in Blekko’s search results.\nIn 2011, Blekko went on the offensive against Google over spam, launching a “spam clock” website at spamclock.com that counted up the one million spammy web pages that Blekko claimed were being published online every hour. This was just as the debate on content farms and Google was really heating up, and in early 2011 Blekko even announced that it was banning content farms from its index. About three weeks later, Google announced the Panda algorithm update , its own effort to combat spam in search results — by no means a response to Blekko’s announcement, but certainly indirect validation that Blekko, and others who had been complaining about the amount of spam in Google’s search index, were on to something.\nBlekko has remained out of the news for almost two years, though, with some of its last mentions being a search app for tablets and a joint funding round/layoffs .\n", "deleted" : false }

Just ask Robert Oppenheimer . But some of the technologies that we're most familiar with have also been twisted into new uses - far from what their creators imagined. Here are ten of the most fascinating.\n1. Smartphones as weather stations\nThe mobile phone in your pocket contains a lot of sophisticated sensors - for light, temperature, pressure, magnetic field and location, among other things. This data can be tremendously useful to meteorologists trying to forecast the weather, so British company OpenSignal has built an app called Weathersignal that collects this data from Android handsets and then uses it to improve forecasts. It's proved effective enough that the Met Office has expressed an interest in getting hold of the raw data for its own use.\n2. Kinect for 3D scanning\nMicrosoft's Kinect sensor, originally built for games, has been hacked endlessly by developers keen to get access to its cheap-and-cheerful 3D capabilities, as seen in Buzzy electropop duo Avec Sans' video for Shiver .\nShortly after Kinect's launch, DIY electronics specialists Adafruit Industries offered a bounty for the first open-source drivers. At first, Microsoft closed ranks and said it refused to condone the modification of its products, but later it rolled back and said that the USB interface had been left open by design. Either way, Kinect is now used widely for cheap 3D imaging.\n3. Wi-Fi for location\nWi-Fi networks are traditionally built for communication, and they're good at it - the technology has proliferated around the world for that very reason. But they're also used by companies like Google, Navizon and Skyhook Wireless to locate you effectively in urban areas.\nAfter years of struggling with GPS chips, it's now much quicker and easier to locate you from what networks you can see around you, and how strong the signal is. As an added bonus, it even works perfectly indoors. The only place you now need GPS is far from civilization.\n4. The theremin as an instrument\nLeon Theremin and his invention\nHere's a little-known-fact - the theremin wasn't originally intended to be a musical instrument at all. The spooky sounds it produces were the result of Russian research into proximity sensors in the 1920s, after the outbreak of the Russian civil war.\nIts inventor, Léon Theremin , patented the device in 1928, then embarked on a grand tour of Europe playing his new creation to packed-out audiences. Eventually he found his way to the United States, where it became an instant hit.\n5. Twitter in crisis situations\nAmong all the misspelt hashtags, rage and photos of what people are having for dinner, Twitter is really quite good at sharing information between large groups of people in emergencies. That's pretty far from its original goals as a status update tool, but it's been of tremendous utility following numerous natural disasters, political uprisings and other crisis situations. Most famously, the service been credited with the early organisation behind the 2010-2011 revolutions across the Middle East . Not bad for an app originally described as \"a short burst of inconsequential information\".\n6. Minecraft in education\nEducational Minecraft mod qCraft\nSwedish bedroom coder Notch knew he was onto a good thing when he created Minecraft, but he never imagined that his creation would be used by Google to teach quantum physics to the next generation of coders. That's the idea of qCraft , anyway, a mod for the game that introduces certain principles that are only possible at a quantum scale. It's not the only attempt to integrate Minecraft into education either - the team at Minecraftedu.com have a whole stack of ways to bring the blocky sandbox game into schools.\n7. The Mosquito as a ringtone\nIt's difficult to outsmart a generation of children who've grown up with the technology that we're still fumbling around working out how to use. The best example of this is the Mosquito - an electronic device that generates a sound that can only be heard by young people. It was originally sold to prevent teenagers loitering in public places, but a campaign to ban it as an abuse of human rights fell apart after it was swiftly co-opted as a ringtone that couldn't be heard by teachers if it rang during class.\n8. Loudspeakers as weapons\nSonic anti-piracy weapons\nSpeaking of sonic weaponry, militaries across the world have developed loudspeakers that can injure, incapacitate and torture opponents . Extremely high-power sound waves can damage the eardrums of a target, causing both pain and disorientation, while less-powerful noises can still be used for temporary crowd control purposes - police in Pittsburgh used sound cannons against protesters during the G20 summit. Ultrasound weapons may become part of our future too - tests on mice have shown lung and liver damage can take place above 184 decibels. Ultrasound is well beyond the range of human ears, so you'd never hear it coming.\n9. iPads for surgery\nAugmented reality apps have much promise for the world, but in most areas that promise has yet to be delivered. One exception is the use of iPads in surgery - German surgeons snapped a picture of a patient's liver with an iPad camera, then used pre-surgery scans to overlay details of where structures such as tumours and blood vessels were situated to help them find their way around. Being able to see the entire organ in three dimensions allowed the team to avoid damaging complications.\n10. PlayStation 3 curing cancer\nStanford University's protein folding research\nFinally, between March 2007 and November 2012, you could use your PlayStation 3 to contribute to the fight against cancer. Citizen science initiative Folding@home allowed PS3 owners to use the console's processor to crunch through protein folding simulations with high efficiency, delivering a 20x speed boost over PCs being used for the same task. During the time it was available, PS3 users contributed more than 100 million hours of computation to the Folding@home project, which the team behind it described as a \"game-changer\". No pun intended. We hope.\nArticle continues below\n", "deleted" : false }

The news is a significant boost for Google, as the company looks to close the gap on Amazon Web Service (AWS), the leading cloud data service provider in the market. Apple has apparently chosen Google’s data platform to help diversify away from a reliance on Amazon’s platform and Microsoft’s Azure, although the company will continue to make use of these services too.\nGoogle has been looking to secure a number of larger businesses for its platform, and may have offered a significant deal to its tech rival. The company has long been a distant third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. A recent RightScale survey found that only 6 percent of respondents used Google’s infrastructure, while 17 percent use Microsoft, and 57 percent opt for Amazon. Sources have suggested that Apple is spending a significant amount for Google’s Cloud Platform, with the figure pegged at somewhere between $400 and $600 million for the year.\nHowever, the deal may not last into the long term. Apple also appears to be building its own in house system to store data from its millions of consumer devices. Apple has announced that it will be opening three data centers soon, as it looks to cut the estimated $1 billion that it spent purchasing data services from Amazon last year. Analysts expect that Apple may break even on its own data centers in about three years, as costs would be lower than the fees it would pay to Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.\nEven if the deal is short lived, Google will continue to step up efforts to secure larger contracts for its data services. Previously the company had focused on smaller companies and start-ups, but last month the tech giant announced that Spotify’s music streaming service would be moving over to the Google Cloud platform from AWS.\nCloud-computing services are a major focus for Google going forward. The company anticipates that it may generate more revenue from these types of services than it does from advertising by the year 2020.\nPosted In\nYay!\nsaksham\nmy uncle works at apple and is developing cloud service for apple ! he wont tell me anything further than that\nNoah Jones\nSUCK IT APPLE!

After earning an associate degree in mobile applications from Miami Dade College in 2012, Duarte spent last year looking for a full-time tech job while he was doing contract work for startups and small tech companies. The salaries he was offered were low, he said, and the companies seemed to be looking for senior people at junior salaries rather than someone they might need to develop.\nOnce Duarte made up his mind to look outside of South Florida, the opportunities shot up - and so did the salaries. He said the job postings in San Francisco carried salaries 30 percent to 45 percent more than similar jobs here. He got interviews quickly. Once he began interviewing, he had an offer from Meltwater in San Francisco within about a month at a salary he said more than made up for the cost of living difference. He started the job in mid-March.\nDuarte said local companies are missing an opportunity by not hiring and training locally grown talent, people who already live here and love the South Florida culture. A good developer can learn and adapt quickly, he and others interviewed for this article said.\nThe CompTIA study did not include metro area statistics, but the Cyberstates researchers provided The Miami Herald with data for South Florida. Trends were similar to the state overall. The average wage in South Florida's tech industry was $83,720. The growth in tech jobs was above the state as a whole, at 4.8 percent versus 3.8 percent, from 2014 to 2015, yet the percentage of private workers in tech, 3.7 percent, trailed the state's 4.5 percent. IT services again led the sectors, followed closely by telecom jobs. South Florida was home to 8,165 tech firms, or about 30 percent of the state's total.\nPositions in mobile development, business intelligence analytics and e-commerce are in high demand, said John Ludwig, director of South Florida for TekPartners staffing firm. Some of South Florida's larger tech employers include Ultimate Software, Citrix System, eBuilder, Magic Leap, CareCloud, 3C Interactive and Modernizing Medicine. Boca Raton-based Modernizing Medicine, for instance, a six-year-old healthcare software company, employs more than 470 workers. CEO Dan Cane believes South Florida's universities spin out plenty of top talent, but it is up to the companies here to hire and nurture it. Too often, he says, South Florida is a net exporter of its talent.\nModernizing Medicine has hired 40 interns over the past four years; about a quarter of those were offered and accepted full-time jobs. Just ask Mihai Fonoage, who was doing graduate work in computer science at Florida Atlantic University when he was hired as an intern; he joined full time after he graduated. That was 2010, and he was the first employee beyond the two co-founders.\n\"After the interview, I knew that this would be more than just a job, it would be a chance for me to be part of something big, something really meaningful,\" he said.\nAfter the interview, I knew that this would be more than just a job, it would be a chance for me to be part of something big, something really meaningful.\nMihai Fonoage, Modernizing Medicine senior director\nNow the Romania native is Modernizing Medicine's senior director of Mobile Software Development, overseeing a team of 10 engineers. At a recent South Florida Technology Alliance event about tech talent that attracted dozens of students, he and other panelists advised students to complement their education with their own side projects, such as building apps, and to participate in hackathons and get involved with the local tech community.\nThere are several initiatives under way to ensure more locally trained tech professionals like Fonoage stay in South Florida and grow the tech economy.\nThe Beacon Council, in partnership with Florida International University, is creating a platform to map and market the tech community, both to companies interested in relocating here and those searching for workers within South Florida, said Lyndi Bowman, director of Economic Development for the council. At the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona in February, the council met with 55 companies expressing interest in relocating or expanding to Miami. Last year, the Beacon Council attracted virtual reality companies AvenuePlanet and Next Galaxy and retained mobile payment company YellowPepper.\nLaunchCode, a nonprofit organization that creates pathways to tech opportunities through apprenticeships, expanded to Miami last year. In its annual report, LaunchCode said 90 percent of its short-term apprenticeships were converted to full-time permanent jobs. \"A statistic we are very proud of is the annual median salary increase pre- to post-LaunchCode is more than 3X — $17,000 to $54,000,\" LaunchCode founder Jim McKelvey said in a recent interview. \"And once you have three or four years' experience, it can be six figures. It's just flat-out life-changing.\"\nThe Idea Center, Miami Dade College's entrepreneurship hub, has been offering its version of a popular Harvard coding class, CS50X, which has provided Corchado Ruiz and more than 350 other people so far with free or low-cost education. Once students have finished the training, LaunchCode has helped them get tech jobs. Meanwhile, a Beacon Council One Community One Goal initiative called the Talent Development Network, based at FIU, is connecting students at all Miami-Dade universities and colleges with paid internships, many of them in tech.\nOrganizations are trying unconventional approaches to connect talent with the opportunities as well. Last month, the Arts + Entertainment District in Miami, NR Investments, The New Tropic media company and the Talent Development Network teamed up to hold a \"Job Flea,\" or an outdoor job fair in downtown Miami in the relaxed style of a flea market complete with music, food trucks and short talks about the job market. While job hunters in many industries turned out, some were finding that available full-time technology positions were in short supply at the inaugural fair. Nir Shoshani of NR Investments said he would like to hold another one later this year and try again to attract more companies actively seeking tech talent.\nAlso last month, the White House announced that Miami and 14 other communities would be joining its TechHire initiative to train and place job candidates in tech. Rick Beasley, CareerSource South Florida executive director, and Arnie Girnun, Florida Vocational Institute president, are co-chairing the TechHire.Miami initiative. More than 100 companies committed to interview qualified graduates that TechHire.Miami partners produce. Through the program, CareerSource South Florida, LaunchCode and others are working to train and place 1,190 individuals into IT jobs by the end of 2017, and 2,415 by the end of 2020.\nStudents Carey MacDonald of Georgia Tech and Gregory Jean-Baptiste of FIU, who spoke at the South Florida Technology Alliance event, are getting prepared for the job market through internships, and shared their strategies with the students in the audience.\nJean-Baptiste has interned at VMWare, Sandia National Laboratories and is currently at Weston-based Ultimate Software. He said the interview at Ultimate Software lasted four hours, but worth it because the company is devoted to finding interns who will be the best fits for the teams they will be working with. \"Ultimate Software challenges you to contribute meaningfully as soon as possible.\"\nMacDonald encouraged the students to show the companies what they are passionate about and what they can do. She interned at 3C Interactive while in high school, and since then has interned at Google twice and is now headed to Microsoft. \"An internship is basically just a long interview.\"\n", "deleted" : false }

She is a fashion consultant and writer and her work has appeared in The New York Times, The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal. You can follow her on Twitter at @alisagouldsimon .\nThe advent of blogging has dramatically changed the face of the fashion industry — and fashion media in particular — in just a few years. Fashion bloggers have evolved from stigmatized outsiders to lauded insiders, sending scores of seasoned marketing executives and editors’ heads spinning.\nToday, bloggers are not only creating editorial to rival that of the glossies, they’re leveraging myriad talents in shooting lookbooks, styling them, and, in some cases, starring in them. In addition, they're hosting events, dressing the windows of some of 5th Avenue’s finest storefronts — after catching a fashion show from the front row, of course — and moving product on behalf of retailers.\n“There’s a personality behind these blogs,” says Ian Schatzberg, development director of Fashion Networks. Fashion Networks recently debuted Now Manifest , a highly curated content aggregate for a handful of the biggest names in the fashion blogging biz, which it sells ads across. This distinction — that of the prevalence of singular personas behind the vast majority of style blogs — is an important one when reflecting on fashion’s blogosphere in relation to that of say, music or art.\n“There’s something about blogger media, where a lot of it is personality-driven,” adds Schatzberg, and that includes dozens upon dozens of visual representations of the personalty in question. Take the ubiquitous outfit post, for example. \"There is a prominence of who the author is... It’s very strong, personality-focused media.”\nManagement Agencies Move In\nIn this niche pocket of the blogosphere where personality (and aesthetics) are paramount, larger-than-life personas have proven potent when it comes to selling product. And, with the exponential growth of the commercial influence of some of fashion’s most recognizable bloggers, an influx of management looking to represent the industry’s new money-making machines has followed suit.\nManila-bred Bryanboy , who pens a namesake blog (tagline: “I’m so gay I sweat glitter”) was recently added to CAA’s talent roster (where he joins the likes of Tom Cruise). LA-based Emily Schuman, the face and voice behind Cupcakes & Cashmere , likewise has secured Hollywood representation through William Morris Endeavors. Rumi Neely , on the other hand — who has starred in a campaign for Forever 21, walked for Rebecca Minkoff and designed for Revolve clothing among other endeavors — is represented by NEXT models.\n“There’s no difference to Hollywood in that someone might be worth a lot of money because they know how to open a movie. If [a blogger] can convert 14,000 people in a week for you, that’s worth something,” says Karen Robinovitz, who co-founded the digital management agency Digital Brand Architects (DBA)  in 2010 with Kendra Bracken-Ferguson, formerly of Ralph Lauren. The agency manages a growing roster of bloggers including photographer-blogger Jamie Beck and Lindsey Calla of Saucy Glossie , landing them roles in everything from TV shows and commercials to print ad campaigns.The agency also develops social media strategy for brands, sometimes bringing the two sides of its business together.\n“We believe that if someone is providing a service you would normally pay someone for — a model, photographer, stylist, designer, etc. — then the blogger should be compensated appropriately,” Robinovitz argues. “Someone needs to be able to communicate on both sides – business with brands and publishing creative content. We are out to make sure that both the brand and the blog have a win at the end of the day and have created incredibly successful partnerships as a result.”\nAnd navigating that unfamiliar territory can be overwhelming for a brand or retailer unfamiliar with the space, or a blogger not schooled in the world of corporate partnerships — especially given the unprecedented types of collaborations that can arise out of a marriage of the two.\nPhotographer Craig Arend of Altamira.com said that signing with DBA put him on a \"fast-track to corporate collaborations.\" And the timing was right. “Financially, revenue is way up as a result of being with them. I’ve doubled my revenue in the last six months doing it with DBA versus when I was doing it on my own independently.”\nAs Arend puts it, the potential payoff likewise vastly outweighed any possible risk. \"There was limited financial downside and unlimited financial upside.”\nNot All Bloggers Are Signing On\nHigh-profile management or representation has not, however, played a distinct role in Leandra Medine’s rise to sartorial stardom.\n“I was totally winging it,” Medine, founder of the wildly popular blog The Man Repeller (which drives 1.2 million page views a month), muses of her nascent stages as a blogger. (Although, she does admit to utilizing the services of an entertainment lawyer on occasion.)\n“My strategy was always take every day as it comes and do as much as you can. I really never had any sort of strategy the way Jane Aldridge really doesn’t oversaturate herself and keeps exclusive and high-end. I figured, I’m just going to take it as it comes because Internet turnover is so quick. If it’s hot right now, it could very well mean that it sucks tomorrow,\" she says.\nFor Medine, guidance from her father and a thorough investigation of possible profit generators has helped contribute to her success. She has trademarked \"Man Repeller\" and \"Arm Party\" (pending) thanks to urging from the former. As for the latter: “I didn’t start accepting money through an affiliate program until two months ago. The amount of money that I’m making from that affiliate program is astonishing,” says Medine, who notes that she has earned over $10,000 in the past two months through the program.\nAs Medine points out, brand partnerships can mean many things for a blogger. “When I’m working with other brands, my first question is, ‘What am I doing for you?’ and ‘Do you want me to blog about it?’ Because, if it’s attached to the blog I’ll charge two to three times the amount.” Medine adds, \"It’s all about setting benchmarks: I did one gig in May where I styled mannequins and made $5,000. I decided that I’m no longer going to do styling gigs for $500 or $1,000 if I can hold onto my guns and get more. For Fashion’s Night Out, I had it in my head that I didn’t want to leave the night if I don’t have five figures in my pocket. I feel, I’m at the height of my popularity; I’ll probably never be so famous. So, I turned down 14 gigs, but instead did four gigs, and I surpassed what I wanted to.”\nAn Evolving Landscape\nSigned or unsigned, the landscape of digital advertorial and blogger endorsements is evolving. In fact, it's looking more and more like that of traditional fashion media, with brands buying ad space and advertorials.\n“There’s a relationship between editorial and advertising, and there are ways of building relationships with a site through advertising,\" observed one source off the record.\nBut, as much as bloggers can learn from the Vogue magazines of the world, this is a decidedly unprecedented era in fashion.\nOf the fashion blogosphere today, Medine says, “It’s a funny comparison, but it reminds me of the Facebook movie [The Social Network] and Jessie Eisenberg’s character, who didn’t want to start accepting ads yet. How can we monetize it, if ‘we don’t know what it is yet.’ No one really knows what it is.\"\n", "deleted" : false }

The Wall Street Journal has been reporting for months about this push for original content, and YouTube just officially confirmed these reports with a post on its blog . It reads, in part:\n“Cable television expanded our viewing possibilities from just a handful of channels to hundreds, and brought us some of the most defining media experiences of the last few decades– think MTV (s via), ESPN (s dis) and HBO (s twx). Today, the web is bringing us entertainment from an even wider range of talented producers, and many of the defining channels of the next generation are being born, and watched, on YouTube.”\nAdvertisement\nYouTube will use the new influx of celebrities to launch a number of high-profile channels, including a new dance, a comedy and a Hispanic channel, which will feature Modern Family star Sofia Vergara. These channels will consist of a mix of short- and long-form content, and everything will be published with a TV-like schedule, meaning that new episodes of a particular show may be published every Tuesday afternoon at 3pm. Some content, including a show produced by My Damn Channel , will even be broadcast live.\nAdvertisement\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that content makers will get some significant advances, and keep 55 percent of YouTube’s ad revenue after these advances are going to be recouped.\nAdvertisement\nContent will be available globally and on any device – which of course includes the Google TV platform that is going to receive a much-needed update in the coming days.\nAdvertisement\nI’ve heard from people familiar with the project that YouTube folks see it as additive to cable, but the timing in conjunction with the Google TV relaunch and the direct references to MTV and HBO could also be seen as a bit of a muscle flexing towards the traditional broadcast and cable networks. Almost all networks decided to block Google TV from accessing their web content when the platform launched a year ago. With YouTube attracting major talent for its own site, Google also seems to signal: Thanks cable, but we’re doing just fine without your websites.\nAdvertisement\n", "deleted" : false }

For the first time in 10 years, it has an area dedicated to startups, and a number of those companies are focusing on digital imaging.\n@GreeterDan\nDot, from Kogeto, makes it possible to shoot 360-degree video from an iPhone, and soon, an Android device. Kogeto\nWhen you think of the companies at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, you tend to think of giants like Sharp, Samsung, Nokia, Fuji, and so forth.\nThat's especially true when it comes to digital imaging, a field dominated by the likes of Sony, Panasonic, and Toshiba.\nBut this year, CES is rolling out the red carpet to a wide range of startup companies, which will be showcasing their wares under the banner of \"Eureka Park.\" All told, more than 80 young companies will be on hand, representing fields such as robotics, energy , digital health, gaming, and so on.\nEureka Park is CES' first \"big attempt at attracting startups\" in 10 years, said Karen Chupka, senior vice president of events and conferences for the Consumer Electronics Association, which puts on CES. \"At that time, the effort didn't go well. It was too soon after the dot-com implosion, and too early before the next wave of tech and startup excitement.\"\nBut this year, startups are all the rage, and CES clearly wants to get in on the party, despite the hundreds of miles between Las Vegas and Silicon Valley. While CES initially hoped for 30 companies to take part, each of which had to be bringing something entirely new to market, more than 80 ended up signing on. \"With the state of the economy and people going and starting on their own, the timing is good,\" Chupka said. \"The last one was before the whole tech boom started.\"\nDigital imaging\nOne of the Eureka Park categories with the most companies expected to show up is what's being called \"digital imaging.\"\nThis is, of course, very broadly defined, especially when looking at what the companies in the category actually do. Some are working on tiny projectors that can be embedded in mobile devices, others are working on new ways for mobile devices to shoot panoramic video, and still others are coming out with tablets aimed at kids.\nKogeto\nKogeto is a hot startup based in New York that's trying to create an entirely new space: 360-degree videos shot by smartphones.\nThe company has been selling its Dot device--an add-on for iPhone 4 and 4S--for some time. The little accessory makes it possible to shoot 360-degree video from anywhere.\nAs CEO Jeff Glasse put it, the device is designed to let its users do anything from shooting video while snowboarding--and then going back and looking at all the surrounding area around the ski run--to shooting video of the kids for grandma.\nThe company got going in its current format last June and now has about 15 full-time people. Glasse self-funded Kogeto from the get-go, but now it is looking for a $3 million A round.\nThat should help, as Glasse said that Apple is about to put Dot in all its retail stores nationwide. That means the company is having to rapidly ramp up production. At the moment, it is producing about 600 Dots a day, but Glasse said that number will rise to between 800 and 1,000 a day in order to satisfy the Apple Store needs.\nFor now, Dot is only available for iPhone, but Glasse said he hopes that by CES, Kogeto will be able to show off an Android version. As well, sometime in 2012, Kogeto will be rolling out what Glasse called Dot-casting--live broadcasting.\nMezmeriz\nOne of the technologies that will be breaking out any day now is what is known as pico projection. With this, small projectors are embedded in mobile devices, allowing users to screen videos, movies, and other information just about anywhere.\nA lot of companies are playing in this space, and one of the newest is called Mezmeriz.\nSpun out of Cornell Research, Mezmeriz is working on pico projection technology that takes advantage of the company's work in material science, said CEO Brad Treat. Traditionally, this type of projection system has been built on technology called MEMS (micro-electromechanical system) that is made out of silicone. But Mezmeriz is taking a different approach.\nAccording to Treat, the company's technology utilizes high-strength carbon fiber instead of silicone, and that gives its projection system some significant advantages, he said. Among them are better power efficiency, angle of deflection, fatigue strength, and drop strength (the ability to survive being dropped).\nThe biggest advantage, Treat added, is that devices using Mezmeriz projection technology will have a very wide projection angle, and that could mean that users will be able to set up much closer to walls or tables or other \"screens\" than other such systems. And that is what could change the game, Treat said. \"You can turn any surface into a screen, a tabletop, my hand, my shirt, every surface can become a screen,\" he added. \"It really opens up the possibilities.\"\nThough Mezmeriz will be appearing in Eureka Park, Treat said the company won't be showing its technology there. In fact, he explained that the company is appearing at the request of the National Science Foundation, one of its funders.\nKaruma\nAlthough it seems the iPad has an insurmountable lead in the tablet space, that doesn't mean there's no room for other manufacturers of the small computers.\nKaruma's Play Base, a new low-cost tablet that could be attractive for children or adults looking for a cheap iPad alternative. Karuma\nBut Apple's success means that companies wanting to make a name for themselves in the field are probably best off looking to create something that has a focused target audience rather than the wide mainstream appeal of the iPad.\nOne company following that approach is Karuma, a Singapore-based outfit that is making a tablet aimed at kids.\nKnown as the PlayBase , the tablet is small--just over 325 grams, and just 9.7 millimeters thick. It has a metal rear housing and a built-in stand. It's also meant to be easy to hold due to a curved back and sides. The device runs on Android, and has a 7-inch LCD display. It comes with 8 GB of storage, but that can be augmented with up to 32 GB of Micro SD.\nThis is clearly a budget tablet, and meant to take on the low end of the market. Some feel it's aimed at kids , though adults looking for a cheap iPad alternative may find it attractive.\nTags:\n", "deleted" : false }

The Google Ventures-backed company works with major app publishers and enables millions of customer conversations. Prior to Apptentive, Robi worked at Yahoo! and built WebEx's pricing strategy. When he's not building Apptentive you can find Robi running, reading and on Twitter @rganguly.\nEarly on, we decided that what we call \"customer love\" is a requirement, not an option. For many companies, the goal to treat customers better -- to appreciate and listen to them -- is important, but hard to justify in the context of a business. Prioritizing something \"fuzzy\" like customer love is often viewed as a nice-to-have that can't get the investment it needs because the ROI is too vague. We beg to differ.\nIf your customers love you, they are more forgiving of mistakes, they are loyal and they evangelize for you. And yes, loyal, vocal fans tend to translate into a higher lifetime value (LTV).\n\"But where's the ROI?\" your colleagues ask, as you evangelize a more human approach to the customer. \"How do I measure customer love?\" \nMeasuring customer love comes down to five key metrics: low churn rates, higher margins, deeper adoption and account growth, increased influencer/evangelist marketing and accelerated product development. Let's take a deeper look at how to approach each of these points.\nLow Churn Rates\nIt's no secret that your most vocal critics can turn into your most loyal customers. But customer love is required to take that customer from a negative space to a positive one. Without it, customers are likely to jump ship and hop on your competitor's boat.\nFor those who have been paying attention to the growth of the \"Customer Success\" industry, we've seen several meaningful companies like Gainsight, PreAct and Totango appear on the scene to help with problems around churn. As each of these companies will tell you, the most important thing you can do to maintain high rates of revenue growth is keep your existing customers happy and using your products. By being better at engaging with customers, reaching out and proactively solving problems, you'll meaningfully impact your churn rates. For mobile app businesses -- which represent our customers -- this is such a large problem ( 70 percent of customers  will leave apps without a messaging feature in a month) that a 5 to 10 percent increase in retention can have a 30 to 40 percent increase in a company's growth rate.\nHigher Margins\nIf you adopt the customer love philosophy, customers will understand and appreciate the value-add they receive from the level of personalized attention your team pays them, and they'll be willing to pay a premium price.\nCustomer love isn't about exceptional customer service. It's about caring enough to earn your customer's respect by going out of your way to provide them with an exceptional customer experience every single day. Make it your mission to understand your customers' wants and needs. Then, structure your offerings around their interests. Your customers will appreciate you tailoring your business, and you'll create a better product or service in the process.\nDeeper Adoption and Account Growth\nWhen it comes to measuring the impact really investing in your customer experience has on the bottom line, focus on the inputs to your lifetime value calculation. Churn, adoption, satisfaction, growth in spend, assistance in customer acquisition: these are all ways in which happier customers vote for your business with their actions. Investing in your team and processes in order to delight more of your customers will pay you back in spades.\nIncreased Influencer/Evangelist Marketing\nAt Apptentive, we've seen incredibly high retention rates for a SaaS business, with a tremendous amount of evangelism and sharing. In our enterprise business, we've seen a 99 percent retention rate in the last year. Our customers go to bat for us, they recommend us to their colleagues and they work with us to make our product better over time. The symbiotic relationship between our team and our customers ensures that we're building something that matters for the long run. \nAccelerated Product Development\nAs a technology organization, we often look at a blank slate with the opportunity to build anything. But the challenge is picking what to build. Increasingly, an active and ongoing conversation with our customers helps us identify the larger, strategic, commonly valuable capabilities we need to be working on. In an environment where your customers understand that you're listening and want to hear more, they're much more likely to tell you their biggest problems. Any time you can cut waste from the product development process and emphasize the most important work, you're putting money back in the company's pockets and often, accelerating revenue growth.\nCommitting to earning customer love should be a priority.

The company believes Flash will be completely gone within the next two years. So what's replacing it?\nRight now, H.264 is still the leading video codec, making up 72 percent of online videos. But H.264 isn't new, it's been around for 13 years, and the next generation of codecs are starting to pick up steam. WebM — which is royalty-free — is on pace to be the next big video codec, with 12 percent of the market and the leading HTML5 video delivery system for Chrome and Firefox.\nH.265 or HEVC, the format The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  anointed as the successor to H.264 is growing, but only makes up 6 percent of the market, half of WebM's reach. The lack of growth is likely due to the fact that companies using the codec must pay royalty fees to the patent owners, unlike its competitor WebM. But with the ability to reproduce content at half the bitrate as H.264 and with support from  Netflix who uses it for 4K streaming and Apple's FaceTime (on newer devices), the expectation is H.265 will become a mainstream codec right along with WebM.\n", "deleted" : false }

But in a recent interview, 500 Startups founder Dave McClure said those complaints are misguided.\nMcClure was interviewed Thursday by TechCrunch’s Alexia Tsotsis  at the Founder Institute ‘s Founder Showcase. During the interview (video embedded below), McClure made it clear that he sees no problem in backing a lot of startups. When comparing 500 Startups to Y Combinator’s Paul Graham, he said his firm is “more of a singles or a doubles hitter” in contrast to Graham’s search for home runs. He estimated that 500 Startups has invested in more than 250 companies, and when asked if he could name all of them, said, “No, no fucking way. With a spreadsheet in front of me, yes. I’m allowed to do that.”\nMcClure also ran through some rapid-fire math to argue that more firms should be taking his approach. Take a firm with a $500 million fund — it’s probably looking for a return of $1.5 billion in 10 years, and since it will typically own 20 percent of a company at exit, that means its startups need to be acquired or IPO for a total of $7.5 billion. And given the normal success rate of VCs, that means the firm is really leaning on a few exits to earn more than $1 billion.\n“It’s too small a sample size,” McClure said. “Expecting that you’re going to get billion-dollar wins out of 30 picks is tough.”\nAt that point, Alexia wanted to know if McClure is “single-handedly responsible for the Series A Crunch,” and he fired back that “the framing of that is just wrong.” What’s really happening, he said, is that it’s much easier to build a company now. As for later-stage investors who are complaining, the trend should actually help them, because it means they get to choose from more companies: “It’s not really their problem, except on a selection basis.” And many startups aren’t going to need a traditional Series A, McClure said, because they will start earning revenue or can look for alternative sources of funding.\nAnyway, McClure said the approach seems to be working for him. He said 500 Startups has invested about $19 million of the $29 million that it has raised, and that it’s currently showing a profit of 30 or 40 percent, though those gains are currently “unrealized.” He added: “We might do other things to increase that sum at some point.” When pressed on whether that means he’s going to be fundraising soon, McClure demurred, saying that any comments on that front would probably be a violation of SEC regulations.\n“Which is a stupid fucking law, which should change,” he said. “I will change that in five years.”\n", "deleted" : false }
