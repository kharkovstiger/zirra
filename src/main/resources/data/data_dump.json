Now it powers Netflix, Airbnb and the Ministry of Justice\nThu 2 Feb 2017 02.00\u00a0EST\nLast modified on Tue 9 Jan 2018 15.56\u00a0EST\nShare via Email\nAmazon has diversified way beyond its simple shopping business. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images\nAmazon is big. In its last financial quarter, it sold $32bn (\u00a325.6bn) worth of stuff worldwide, including $6bn of media, $10bn of sales outside North America, and $23bn of electronics \u201cand other general merchandise\u201d. That \u201cother\u201d category encompasses everything from crucifixes to sex toys, board games to plyboard, and mousemats printed with the faces of obscure TV and Radio personalities .\nIt has also diversified beyond its simple shopping business: the company will sell you something to be delivered in less than one hour, food from restaurants, and even digital content to be watched on your TV or listened to on your phone. And, of course, it has a hardware business which many other companies would kill for, producing ebook readers and tablets, and single-handedly creating the product category of \u201csmart speaker\u201d with the Echo.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nAmazon Echo voice-controlled speakers, which went on sale in the UK last September. Photograph: Mikael Buck/Rex/Shutterstock\nBut there\u2019s another chunk of Amazon that you\u2019re less likely to know about. It\u2019s responsible for a full tenth of the company\u2019s revenues, yet its \u201coperating income\u201d \u2013 the amount of money it leaves in Amazon\u2019s coffers once expenses are accounted for \u2013 dwarfs any other sector, pulling in $861m compared to the $255m Amazon makes in North American sales and the $541m it loses internationally.\nThe division is Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the section of the company that sells cloud computing services to both the outside world and to Amazon itself. You can buy storage space to hold a huge database, bandwidth to host a website, or processing power to run complex software remotely. It lets companies and individuals avoid the hassle of buying and running their own hardware, while also letting them pay for only what they actually use.\nIt began as almost a point of principle for Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, before evolving to become the single most profitable part of the entire company. Now, AWS is moving into the third stage of its life, providing the underpinning for Amazon\u2019s own quest to dominate not just our shopping, but our homes themselves.\nWhat actually is AWS?\nThe sort of people who use AWS are almost as varied as the people who shop at Amazon. I employed it when I decided to train a neural network to write Guardian leaders : work that would have taken around 50 hours on my laptop took eight when I employed Amazon\u2019s specialised hardware to do the job, and cost around \u00a34.\nAt the other end of the scale, Netflix uses AWS for almost all its backend infrastructure, storing and streaming its web series from the same servers as its direct competitor, Amazon Instant Video \u2013 servers which Amazon owns. More than 35% of all network traffic in North America is Netflix , and all of that ultimately comes from Amazon\u2019s servers.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nMore than 35% of all network traffic in North America is Netflix, Amazon Instant Video\u2019s biggest rival. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters\nIts customer list is huge running from Adobe and Airbnb to Yelp and Zapproved, via the UK Ministry of Justice and Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But at the beginning, it had just one customer: Amazon.\nBefore it was Amazon Web Services, it was just Amazon\u2019s backend technology. Like any large dotcom in the early 00s, Amazon ran its own datacentre, spending millions on servers and software. One SEC filing from May 2001 put its quarterly technology bill at $55m, apparently reduced from $70m through the switch to the open-source operating system Linux. (Linux is still used in Amazon\u2019s servers today, though the scale is somewhat larger: in fact, Amazon actually develops its own version of the operating system, which it offers to AWS customers.)\nThen, one day, Bezos issued a mandate. Writing almost a decade later, long-term Amazon employee Steve Yegge remembered it as the archetypal example of Bezos\u2019 micromanag ement. This is a chief executive who, Yegge said, \u201chands out little yellow stickies with his name on them, reminding people \u2018who runs the company\u2019 when they disagree with him\u201d; mandates from on high are standard when you work under Bezos.\nBut this one was different. Every team at Amazon, Bezos said, should begin working with each other in standard, systematic ways, and only those ways. If the ads team needed sales figures from the analytics, they weren\u2019t allowed to ask for them, or send an email over; instead, the analytics team had to build an interface for pulling the sales figures out, share it with the whole company and teach the ads team how to use it. And those interfaces weren\u2019t allowed to be simplistic things built for internal use only; they had to withstand being opened up to developers outside Amazon, too.\nIn effect, Bezos was asking Amazon to stop behaving like one singular company, and start behaving like hundreds of mini companies all bound together through one shared CEO. That command was the beginning of Amazon Web Services, which launched in July 2002 .\nYegge, who left for Google in 2005, wrote that \u201cfrom the time Bezos issued his edict through the time I left, Amazon had transformed culturally into a company that thinks about everything in a services-first fashion.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nAmazon first opened its internal services up to the outside world in 2000, when it launched eBay rival Marketplace. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty\nThe roots of this transformation were there for everyone to see. The first example of Amazon opening its internal services up to the outside world came in 2000, when the company launched Marketplace , its platform for external retailers to sell their goods through the Amazon website. A bold move, it demonstrated the scope of Amazon\u2019s ambitions \u2013 directly competing with another dotcom giant, eBay, even while it was still focusing on matching wits with the old masters of brick and mortar retail. But it also showed the company was already keenly aware about which parts of its business were tightly guarded unique selling points, and which could be opened up to the rest of the world. Amazon wanted to make money selling you everything it could, and make money selling you everything it couldn\u2019t, too.\nSome spotted this transformation as it happened, but drew the wrong conclusions. In 2001, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson argued that Amazon should spin its logistics operation off from its web storefront, letting other companies outsource their warehousing and dispatching to the new firm while Amazon focused on its website business. Instead, Amazon kept its logistics firmly in-house, relentlessly improving efficiencies, until 2006, when it opened that up too. Through Fulfilment by Amazon, companies can now outsource their warehousing and dispatching to Amazon even while Amazon itself continues to own those warehouses.\nIn 2006, the fruits of that externalisation came to bear when Amazon launched AWS to the outside world.\nAnd it grew\nWhen it launched, AWS was little more than a fancy way to buy space and time on Amazon\u2019s computers. It had spent years in private beta, gradually allowing more and more customers to take advantage of the service-led structure that Amazon had invented for itself, and eventually coalesced into four services: storage, computing, database and internal messaging.\nThe first two, sold as Amazon S3 (for \u201cSimple Storage Service\u201d) and EC2 (for \u201cElastic Computing Cloud\u201d), still provide the bulk of Amazon\u2019s offering to customers now. Storage plus computing is the basis of almost everything you would want to do on the internet, from simple stuff like hosting webpages and delivering media to hideously complicated work like training a neural network, crunching regressions on big datasets, or just running a company like Airbnb or Pinboard.\nBut before AWS, if you wanted to get storage and computing power on the net, you had to hire server time to do it. That meant tracking down a server provider, picking the type of machine you wanted, and paying every month for your stuff to carry on sitting on that machine (usually paying on top for any bandwidth you used to actually get data from the server to your customers).\nThat leads to a host of predictable problems. If too many people visited your site all at once, it would crash under the load; but if you bought, or leased, a server big enough to handle them all, you\u2019d be paying through the nose for power you weren\u2019t using.\nWhile useful on a day to day basis, that flexibility takes on a whole new meaning when viewed over the course of a company\u2019s life. Scaling up is traditionally one of the hardest things for any startup to do: systems, procedures and products that work for a few users often fail when a company has a few million.\nOne of the most notorious examples in recent years is Twitter, which found out early in its life that the old-fashioned, server-focused way it was built was simply not compatible with it becoming a worldwide media platform. The first obvious crunch point was the 2010 World Cup, when Twitter would regularly get overloaded and crash to its error page, featuring the notorious \u201cfail whale\u201d. Initially, Twitter tried to \u201c throw machines at the problem \u201d, simply buying more and more servers, but eventually it realised it needed a more complex, ground-up redesign of its entire back-end.\nThe year after Twitter was founded, another service decided to launch without buying into the old-fashioned model. Dropbox, launched in 2007, probably couldn\u2019t have existed without the existence of Amazon\u2019s storage-for-rent. The company ran its own servers for the nitty gritty of the service, storing metadata about whose files were where in-house, but the actual files themselves \u2013 the gigabytes of free space every new user is given, and the terabytes of space paid users could consume \u2013 were hosted on S3.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nTinder uses AWS, although a 2015 east-coast outage affected the dating service for hours, along with Netflix and a host of Amazon\u2019s own services. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty\nYou\u2019ll have heard the name for the new system pioneered by the likes of Dropbox: cloud computing. Amazon\u2019s cloud was one of the first, and is the biggest in the world today, but it\u2019s still far outweighed by all the companies determined to host their own data. Speaking to the Guardian, Gavin Jackson, the head of AWS for the UK and Ireland, described that \u201cinertia\u201d from traditional IT as the company\u2019s biggest competitor. Admins are still reluctant to host their company\u2019s crown jewels on servers they don\u2019t control.\nCloud on the horizon\nBut enough companies have made the switch that there\u2019s a new problem on the horizon: concentration. Way back in the late 1960s, Arpanet , the predecessor to the internet, was built with a decentralised model: no one server, university or military establishment could take down the network if it was removed. That meant the project, funded by the US department of defence, could theoretically route around damage, making it robust against attack.\nMore than 50 years on, and the internet has changed beyond all recognition. The physical infrastructure routes through a few chokepoints: submarine and underground cables can be cut, knocking internet access offline for whole countries at a time ; major internet service providers are consolidating, allowing action by just a few companies to censor the internet for millions ; and a few major providers acting as the phonebook for the internet are another bottleneck, and if they can be forced offline, the entire eastern seaboard can suffer .\nAmazon Web Services is reaching the size where it might need to be added to that list. A 2015 outage on the company\u2019s eastcoast datacentre, for instance, caused connection issues for Netflix and Tinder for hours, as well as several of Amazon\u2019s own services.\nAmazon\u2019s Jackson argues that it\u2019s wrong to view AWS as anywhere near a single point of failure for the net. \u201cWe\u2019re still day one,\u201d he says, pointing to the fact that AWS\u2019s annual run rate \u2013 the amount of cash it pulls in each year \u2013 is around $10bn. That\u2019s high, but the annual run-rate of the wider internet services market is $3trn. Amazon is a big fish, but swimming in an enormous ocean.\nMore to the point, he argues, Amazon\u2019s customers choose to use them, unlike most internet chokepoints, which are forced through the basic facts of internet infrastructure. If Amazon\u2019s concentration ever becomes a problem, they\u2019re free to up stakes and move over to another cloud provider such as Microsoft or Google, or go back to the good old-fashioned days of self-hosting.\nThe future: Alexa\nOne customer, of course, will likely never leave: Amazon itself. Internally, AWS insists it doesn\u2019t see Amazon as anything other than a large customer. \u201cA very demanding large customer,\u201d Jackson says with a smile, \u201cand a very vocal one.\u201d There\u2019s obvious business reasons for doing so, since some of AWS\u2019s largest customers are direct competitors of the greater Amazon business; Jackson cited Dropbox, Tesco and Netflix as clients that \u201cvote with their wallets\u201d in sticking around (since we spoke, however, Dropbox changed its vote, migrating away from the Amazon cloud ).\nEven if Amazon is just another AWS customer, AWS isn\u2019t merely a backend for Amazon anymore. The cloud provider has gone through several distinct phases in its history, from wildly ambitious project, to future-proofed data centre, to reliably profitable side-bet. But now it\u2019s moving into a new stage, one which takes it back to the core of Amazon\u2019s business.\nAmazon\u2019s hardware division, which dates back to the launch of the first Kindle in 2007, has traced a similar path to AWS, from weird and ambitious to core project.\nFirst, Amazon\u2019s Kindle e-readers grew from an expensive distraction to the dominant platform of a multi-billion pound industry; then they expanded into general-purpose tablet computing, and multi-platform media streaming. It slowly began to eye the sort of platform dominance that had made Apple the biggest company in the world.\nBut the expensive failure of the Fire Phone, Amazon\u2019s attempt to take on Apple head first, prompted a change in strategy: a slim black cylinder called the Echo. Two years on, the Echo has competition from Google, in the form of the Google Home. But it remains the dominant \u201csmart speaker\u201d on the market, letting users interact with the device by speaking with \u201cAlexa\u201d, Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, at the launch of the Fire Phone, the company\u2019s failed attempt to take on Apple in the smartphone market. Photograph: Ted S. Warren/AP\nIn a way, the device is just an evolutionary step from phone-based assistants like Siri and Google Now. But it also moves those assistants on by opening up the platform to external developers: anyone can write their own Alexa \u201cskill\u201d, from useful mini-apps like MyChef and Philips Hue\u2019s smart-home hub to utterly useless ones like Egg Facts (\u201cStay up to date on the latest egg-related trivia with egg facts\u201d).\nThere are over 7,000 skills on the market now, with more coming every day. And what\u2019s the easiest way to make an Alexa skill? Hosting it in AWS . If you have a small enough userbase, Amazon won\u2019t even charge you for the pleasure, letting budding voice-app developers start small and work their way up, risk-free.\nThe value of Amazon\u2019s decade of experience shouldn\u2019t be discounted, either. Internet services are notoriously hard to pull off at scale: one look at Apple\u2019s continuing struggles to effectively take on Google with its iCloud software suite should be enough to convince on that count. The Echo has the benefit of piggybacking on a much more stable, mature and stress-tested platform than it would have if Amazon had to build its services from the ground up to support cloud-hosted speech-based apps.\nFor a sense of the scale of Amazon\u2019s ambitions for Alexa and the Echo, analyst Ben Thompson suggests it\u2019s worth thinking of the speech service as \u201c Amazon\u2019s operating system \u201d. An operating system is the piece of software that sits between complicated hardware and the user, allowing for standardisation for both software developers and the user interface itself. In that way, it\u2019s almost better to think of Alexa as AWS\u2019s operating system: the first thing from Amazon that opens up the power of its cloud service to end users the world over.\nAmazon has a tough fight on its hands. Google has been in the web services game much longer, and has much more experience creating \u2013 and monetising \u2013 consumer software. The battle for the living room feels a lot like the battle for our pockets was a decade ago: there may just be room for two companies, but no more.\nBut Amazon didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. There\u2019s a reason Alexa was so good, so quickly, and that reason is more than a decade\u2019s experience working in the cloud. Amazon\u2019s latest big bet has already paid off, and now it\u2019s enabling the company\u2019s next big one.\nGlobal reach\n23m: Items ordered from Amazon\u2019s sellers on 28 November 2016 \u2013 Cyber Monday \u2013 up 40% on a year earlier.\n43%: Amazon\u2019s share of total US online sales, based on research by Slice Intelligence.\n64m: Number of customers signed up for the video-streaming service Prime, according to the consultancy cg42.\n5th: Ranking of Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, in the league table of the world\u2019s richest people.\n1.3m: Estimated number of servers that comprise AWS, the enormously profitable cloud computing arm, according to analysts at Oppenheimer.\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

{"title": "Foursquare launches Pilgrim SDK to let developers leverage location", "content": "Context is everything. For a long while, the dream for developers and marketers has been to offer information at the exact right time and the exact right place. Achieving that, however, hasn\u2019t been so simple.\nTo answer the call, Foursquare is unveiling a new enterprise product called Pilgrim SDK.\nFor years, Foursquare has been building out the Pilgrim technology, which is essentially a decision-making engine that figures out where you\u2019re going, where you\u2019ve stopped to hang out, and what you might be interested in nearby. This has been running in the background of Foursquare City Guide and Swarm for a long time now.\nPilgrim is the technology that sends you a push notification with menu tips when you sit down at a restaurant you\u2019ve never visited before. It\u2019s the technology that recognizes you just arrived in a new city and sends you recommendations of places you\u2019d like to eat or hang out.\nUp until today, Pilgrim was used almost exclusively in Foursquare and Swarm, with a select few beta partners testing out the tech. But now, the Pilgrim SDK is launching publicly to marketers and developers who want to use this tech in their own apps.\nThe idea is that any app, from a game to an on-demand service to ecommerce to content, can better serve its end-users by understanding their location. Maybe that means better tracking for Postmates delivery people, or serving up a push notification for a deal when someone enters a retail store, or even changing the difficulty and duration of the level of a game based on where a user is located.\nNow, developers aren\u2019t unfamiliar with the idea of third-party location services. In fact, a new company called Radar recently launched out of Expa Labs \u2014 coincidentally, the same startup studio helmed by Foursquare cofounder Naveen Selvadurai. Radar was founded by former Foursquare employees, and it offers developers the chance to geofence areas and track users (without PII) to serve up contextually relevant information.\nHowever, Foursquare\u2019s Pilgrim SDK already has those geofences set up in the form of its Places data. More than 11 billion check-ins over the span of eight years has given Foursquare highly accurate, highly valuable data around real-world places and activity. Through these check-ins, Foursquare has developed something they call a probabilistic signal cloud.\nThis cloud shows the actual shape of places based on signals like Bluetooth and Wifi, but also lets the shapes of these places evolve based on time and date. For example, a coffee shop\u2019s shape might expand between 7am and 11am, whereas it might shrink back down late at night. Conversely, a bar might represent a rather small shape in the morning and expand at night as people begin showing up for their post-work libation.\nIn a city like New York, the bar and the cafe could be smashed right up next to each other, with Wifi signals that overlap. A marketer for the bar needs to know the difference between a patron of the bar who happens to be smoking a cigarette outside in front of the cafe and someone who\u2019s actually just stopping into the cafe to pick up a muffin.\nIt\u2019s in these nebulous scenarios that Foursquare\u2019s Pilgrim technology really shines.\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of marketers, it\u2019s worth noting that the Pilgrim SDK integrates with a variety of marketing automation software such as Urban Airship, Appboy, Localytics, mParticle, and others.\nThis is far from Foursquare\u2019s first enterprise tool. Places by Foursquare is a database/API tool used by companies like Apple Snapchat, Twitter, Airbnb and more than 100,000 other developers who want to integrate location info into their offerings. The company also has Place Insights (for measuring foot traffic trends), Pinpoint (for media ad-targeting) and Attribution (which measures the effectiveness of digital ad campaigns looking to drive traffic into stores).\nFoursquare isn\u2019t revealing exact pricing for the Pilgrim SDK, but said that it will be structured in tiers based on the number of users and commercial technology licenses will be negotiable. To be clear, Foursquare will be working with brands and marketers on a one-on-one basis for the launch of Pilgrim SDK, so it\u2019s not a free-for-all like the Places API.\nIf you want to check out the Pilgrim SDK, you can find more info right here .\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-01T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The arrival of Reliance Jio as a player in the crowded telecoms market with a \u2018free\u2019 4G service has played havoc with established players. In the UK-EU, the challenge from India\u2019s richest person Mukesh Ambani through Jio might have provided grounds for a predatory pricing hearing.\nIn India, that doesn\u2019t seem to work. Vodafone\u2019s response is to forge a $23bn (\u00a318bn) deal with Idea Cellular, creating a behemoth with 400m customers, making it larger than market leader Bharti Airtel.\nThe winner in the transaction looks to be Idea investors as its shares jumped 14.3 per cent on the announcement and Voda fell 0.4 per cent. With a 45 per cent stake, Voda will be the biggest shareholder in the new company. But the chairman will be chosen by Idea, the chief financial officer will be chosen by Vodafone, and both companies will have to approve the choice of chief executive. Such shared lines of control have a habit of misfiring.\nOn the plus side, Voda gets the chance to cut its net debt by up to \u00a36.6bn. Voda\u2019s foreign entanglements have a mixed record. After running up big losses in Japan, it sold out to Softbank in 2016 and eventually wrote down its operation by a huge \u00a328bn.\nIn contrast in America, it ended up as a minority partner in Verizon Wireless, but was able to sell its interest for a massive \u00a397bn.

{"title": "Uber\u2019s first diversity report is not the worst thing ever", "content": "Megan Rose Dickey @meganrosedickey / 2 years\nUber just released its highly anticipated, first-ever diversity report detailing the demographics of its employees as of this month. The TL;DR is that Uber, like many other tech companies, is predominantly white and male. What surprised me, though, is that Uber fares\u00a0slightly better than Facebook and Apple when it comes to female representation. Uber also has pretty solid representation of people of color, in comparison to other tech companies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re late to release these numbers,\u201d Uber Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey wrote on Uber\u2019s blog today. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their tenacity in arguing the case for greater transparency \u2014 because what you don\u2019t measure, you can\u2019t improve.\u201d\nWorldwide, Uber is 36.1 percent female and 63.9 percent male. In tech roles, women make up just 15.4 percent of the employee base.\nUber\u2019s overall female representation\u00a0is not great, but it\u2019s not as bad as female representation at Facebook \u00a0(32 percent female) and Apple \u00a0(32 percent female), for example. It\u2019s also not as good as female representation at Airbnb , which is 43 percent female, and Pinterest , which is 44 percent female.\nNow about race. Yes, Uber is a predominantly white company (49.8 percent). That\u2019s unfortunately the norm at U.S.-based tech companies, but where Uber shines is in its representation of black and Latinx people.\nOverall, Uber is 8.8 percent black, 5.6 percent Latinx and 4.3 percent two more or races in the U.S. In technical roles, however, those percentages drop to 1 percent, 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.\nHere\u2019s how Uber compares to others: Facebook (2 percent black, 4 percent Latinx, 3 percent two or more races), Apple (9 percent black, 12 percent Latinx, 2 percent multiracial), Airbnb (2.9 percent black, 6.5 percent Latinx) and Pinterest (2 percent black, 4 percent Latinx, 4 percent two or more races).\nAt the leadership level,\u00a022 percent of Uber\u2019s employees are women, 2.3 percent are black, 0.8 percent are Latinx and 76.7 percent are white. Surprise! Uber\u2019s leadership team is mostly a bunch of white men.\nIn light of President Trump\u2019s attack on immigrants, Uber also disclosed that 15 percent of its employees in the U.S. have a work visa and come from 71 different countries, saying that no matter where anyone comes from, Uber wants you to know that you have a place at the company. Uber also said it will continue to speak out against discrimination.\n\u201cThis report is a first step in showing that diversity and inclusion is a priority at Uber,\u201d Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement. \u201cI know that we have been too slow in publishing our numbers \u2014 and that the best way to demonstrate our commitment to change is through transparency. And to make progress, it\u2019s important we measure what matters.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Uber doesn\u2019t currently have specific goals in place. Physical representation of diverse employees is also just one part of the equation. Fostering an inclusive, non-hostile work environment\u00a0where people don\u2019t get sexually harassed is very important.\n\u201cWhile there are many things we need to change about our culture, I believe that making Uber a more diverse and inclusive workplace is key,\u201d Hornsey wrote.\nUber also has committed $3 million over the next three years to support organizations focused on underrepresented minorities and women in tech. Uber has yet to decide which organizations to support, but Hornsey says \u201cemployees will be crucial\u201d in that decision-making process.\nAll of this comes following allegations of sexual harassment from former Uber engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti . Since then, Uber has initiated an internal investigation about the claims and has expressed its commitment to diversity. That all happened in February, about a month after Rev. Jesse Jackson called on Uber to release its data.\n\u201cAs we enter the new year, some 2 \u00bd years since the floodgates opened, we urge Uber to \u2018lean in\u2019 and join the ranks of technology companies that are reporting your diversity and inclusion data,\u201d Jackson wrote in a letter to Kalanick in January, which TechCrunch obtained.\nSpecifically, Jackson called for Uber to publicly disclose its EEO-1 report, disclose the number of new hires made between 2014-2016 and what percentage of them were people of color and report the demographics of its board of directors and C-suite leadership team. Jackson asked to receive this information by February 15, 2017.\nClearly, that didn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t until just about everyone turned against Uber in light of allegations of sexual harassment that the company decided to finally do it.\nBoth Hornsey and Kalanick have noted that Uber has been slow, in comparison to other tech companies, to release its diversity numbers. But, believe it or not, Uber was not the only high-profile tech company holding out. Both Lyft and Snap, for example, have been very quiet on the diversity front.\nMoving forward, Hornsey\u00a0says Uber will work with outside diversity and inclusion experts \u201cwho have been working on these issues for longer than we\u2019ve been around \u2014 and who are working to make change happen.\u201d\nYou can learn more about Uber\u2019s diversity and inclusion initiative on its new site here .\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-28T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

It definitely didn't get one -- which set me to wondering if there are any great names left to be gotten.\nAlready taken\nI remembered a conversation I had in 1997 with Henry Silverman, who was about to merge his HFS, a franchiser of hotels and real estate brokerages, with direct-marketing firm CUC International to create something called Cendant.\nThe name would later be tainted by one of the biggest accounting scandals of the 1990s, but even at the onset Silverman wasn't thrilled about it: \"Every name we liked, either somebody already had it or it wasn't trademarkable or it meant something pornographic in another language.\"\nAround the same time, it turns out, corporate-identity consultant Tony Spaeth was worrying that this could be a larger problem.\nYahoo has a major stake in Jack Ma's Alibaba.\nCredit:Evan Vucci\n\"There is a numeric limit to the universe of names, the combinations of letters of five syllables or less that are pronounceable, avoid offence in principal languages, and are not someone else's property. A population explosion of business entities, on top of product proliferation, means we are rapidly depleting the supply. And as more companies think \"global,\" more seek global name protection, vastly increasing the pool of possible conflicts.\"\nSince then, the number of registered trademarks in the U.S. has more than doubled to almost 2.2 million.\nTech explosion\nDavid Placek, the founder and president of Lexicon Branding Inc., the Sausalito, California-based firm responsible for a lot of familiar names in technology and other fields (BlackBerry, Pentium, PowerBook, Swiffer, Dasani), had someone run a search for me of trademarks for just computing hardware and software: 819,934 in the U.S., and 5.5 million in the 30-odd countries that Lexicon tracks.\nThe digital era's explosion of gadgets and apps has gobbled up available names at a voracious pace.\nFor words of seven letters or fewer, there are 8.4 billion possible letter combinations -- including includes Aaaaaaa and Zzzzzzz. The number of plausible, pronounceable names is much, much smaller.\nSo are we running out?\n\"It is getting harder to find names that are significantly better than something like a Cendant or an Altaba,\" Placek said.\n\"It's not impossible.\"\nAt Lexicon, coping with the shrinking number of available names has meant investing ever more in legal and technological resources to screen names, and using artificial intelligence, linguistics research and other tools to pick better ones.\nAt A Hundred Monkeys, a smaller naming firm across the San Francisco Bay in Berkeley that does a lot of work with startups, the focus is on familiar words.\n\"Actual things that make sense to people in the English language make more sense than trying to get people to align behind a seven-letter word you just invented,\" said creative director Eli Altman.\n'Dotcom' fades\nAltman added that this can mean longer names and internet addresses (although his company still seems to land on a lot of short ones: Buoy, Eero and Hiya, to name three), and that he doesn't think we're running out of those.\nOne thing that seemed like a big problem for the namers 15 years ago is less significant now: Scarce dot-com internet addresses are no longer must-haves\n\"We know from research we've done that, for consumers, having a dot-com is way less important than it was in 2000,\" Placek said.\nAdded Altman: \"Almost everyone uses search to get to where they're going. If you have any type of activity on your site and anyone has a modicum of interest in what you're doing, they'll get there.\"\nThe increased use of voice interfaces such as Apple Inc.'s Siri and Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa ought to make the specifics of URLs even less important.\nStill, there is a finite universe of potential names out there. For words of seven letters or fewer, there are 8.4 billion possible letter combinations -- and that includes Aaaaaaa and Zzzzzzz.\nThe number of plausible, pronounceable names is much, much smaller.\nDrug challenge\nIn pharmaceuticals, where U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency rules aimed at preventing misprescription and consumer confusion sharply limit drug namers' options, there are clear signs of exhaustion.\nWhat else would you call nzetra Xsail, Vemlidy and Taltz (all drugs approved by the FDA last year)?\nFor the rest of the corporate world, I guess we're not quite there yet. The success of Google and Facebook is evidence that what at first seem like really weird or mundane choices can still become familiar and hugely valuable brands.\nIt might be that longer, stranger, clunkier names could eventually become familiar and valuable, too. I'm a big fan of 1980s Chinese business-naming conventions: How about calling your company Fujian Jinjiang Chendai Xibian's No. 2 Daily Necessities Factory.\nStill, the very existence of consultancies specialised in naming -- Placek started Lexicon in 1982, and he thinks it was one of the first -- is indication that the work has gotten harder. It is surely going to get harder still.\nIt strikes me that this may be yet another way in which the room to innovate and carve out market space is being crimped.\nThere's been a recent flurry of economic research into the apparent decline in entrepreneurship and business dynamism in the U.S. since 2000.\nLoading\nOne paper I saw presented at the American Economic Association annual meeting last weekend asked, \"Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?\" Maybe, maybe not.

AI helps Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana answer questions, and also helps self-driving cars cruise the streets safely.\n\"We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community -- stay tuned for more this year,\" a Google spokesman said in an email.\n+ ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD Ultimate guide to Raspberry Pi operating systems, Part 3 +\nEarlier this week, Google published \u00a0a market research survey in an effort to get a better grip on the maker community and its priorities. In the survey, Google hinted it was bringing \"smart tools\" to makers.\nIn a blog entry , Raspberry Pi said those machine-learning tools will come later this year and will make smart devices even more powerful.\n[ Get certified as an Apple Technical Coordinator with this seven-part online course from PluralSight. ]\nDevices could get Google AI technologies like image and speech recognition. For example, a home-brewed robot or drone may be able to better recognize objects with Google's tools, or be able to respond to queries. Google provides APIs (application programming interfaces) so the services can be tweaked in gadgets.\nGoogle's voice recognition is the company's most visible AI technology. The Google Assistant is used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and appliances like Google Home. But the technology hasn't been fully explored in smart devices made using board computers like Raspberry Pi 3.\nProviding a helping hand to makers could provide Google one more avenue to grow in the emerging internet-of-things market. According to analyst firm IHS, shipments of IoT devices will reach 30.7 billion by 2020 and 75.4 billion by 2025, outstripping smartphones and PCs.\nThe spread of Google's AI tools to IoT devices could also help Google take on Amazon, whose Alexa voice assistant dominated CES this year. Alexa is being incorporated into cars, home appliances, and numerous gadgets.\nCompanies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel have also been chasing makers. Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT Core is compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, and makers get access to analytics and machine-learning tools in the Azure cloud.\nSamsung is providing its Artik Board users access to the Artik Cloud, through which makers can access to data analysis services and AI technologies. Artik Cloud also works with Raspberry Pi boards, Amazon Echo, Nest devices, and wearables like Fitbit trackers.\nIt's possible Google could make the machine-learning framework called TensorFlow available to makers. The software could help devices learn based on patterns, input, and trends.\nBut boards don't have much processing power, so the tools could push back decision-making to Google's cloud, which has more powerful AI and data-analysis tools. For example, a robot may have limited image recognition technology\u00a0and may instead consult the cloud when trying to identify an obstacle.\nSome companies like Movidius -- which is a part of Intel -- have modified TensorFlow code to improve computer vision in robots and drones.\nGoogle is also finalizing its IoT technology called Android Things, a lightweight version of the Android OS.

{"title": "How Localization Will Help Alexa Achieve Global Dominance", "content": "\u201cAlexa \u2026 do you know the Queen?\u201d\nAlexa\u2019s ongoing mission for global domination has taken another leap forward.\nOn February 7, Amazon announced that the Alexa Voice Service would now be available to developers that wanted to build voice-enabled products for the United Kingdom and Germany. According to the Amazon Developer Blog, AVS localization provides developers (and by association, brands) with \u201clanguage and region-specific services to expand your audience and delight new customers.\u201d\nTo put that into plain English/non-marketing speak, any developer that wants to build multi-lingual Alexa skills now can. At the same time, European Amazon Echo owners will get not only access to skills with a more local focus, but also Alexa\u2019s regional accents will be available to everybody.\nI can\u2019t deny I was a bit miffed when I turned on the British Echo that I had bought for my sister at Christmas and heard Alexa speak in a voice that was\u2014to put it bluntly\u2014more refined than the quasi-American one that I thought was my only option. Not Downton Abbey-refined, but a touch easier on the ear.\nSo when I found out that AVS was now available in the U.S. to developers building products or skills for the UK and Germany, my heart skipped a beat. I have had no problems with Alexa\u2019s accent since I bought the device, but sometimes a familiar voice is all we need in a daily routine.\nDifferent Accent, Same Amazon Echo Functionality\nFor brands that want to extend their reach into new markets, the decision to open up the AVS to include European voice-user-interface developers is significant.\nAmazon made its cloud-based AVS ecosystem been available to developers from day one, which is one reason why the number of skills available has increased as more units were sold. Amazon has not released actual sales figures for its Echo family\u2014which includes the original device, the Echo Dot and the now-hands-free Echo Tap \u2014but a recent Amazon press release said that \u201c millions of Alexa devices \u201d were purchased in 2016.\nTo date, the global rollout of Alexa has been limited to three countries\u2014the U.S., UK and Germany\u2014but there is little doubt that Amazon has a vision of a world where Alexa is the voice of (almost) every connected device. A limiting factor is that not everybody speaks English as a first language \u2026 a problem if you want to sell devices in, say, France or China or Russia.\nLets think about the global distribution of smartphones.\nThe computer in our pocket is not constrained by language barriers, it is built to be used in whatever country it is sold in. Apple\u2019s much-maligned Siri, for example, can speak and understand seven languages (including Japanese and Mandarin) which makes Alexa\u2019s three\u2014two of which are derivations of English\u2014look a bit isolationist.\nLocalization is an important part of any global device or app strategy. In the same way that not everybody speaks English, not every culture is the same. People from different cultures behave in different ways, with language at the core of that behavior.\nLocalization Fits The Device To The Person\nSo it makes sense that the global success of a voice-enabled personal assistant will need to correspond to the particular nuances of language in whatever region the device resides.\nThis then opens up an interesting road for both brands and developers who would be able to tailor a particular skill to the local customer rather than a global one. Regional versions of app stores are nothing new, but the voice-enabled app or skill market is in a very nascent stage \u2026 and Alexa is leading the way.\nAs a concept, AVS localization is simplicity itself and Amazon provided two examples \u2026 Emma and Ben.\nEmma lives in London and owns an Amazon Echo. She has a UK-based Amazon account to buy stuff. Her Echo is linked to this account, which means that Alexa understands and responds in UK-English. The skills that are available to Emma are also regional. For example, Emma can find out the status of the London Underground\u2014major delays on several lines, probably\u2014or check whether she had the winning balls in the UK Lottery.\nBen is German, but lives in Seattle. When he bought his Echo, his options were limited to US-English as his primary account was linked to the U.S. website. While we can assume that Ben is fairly fluent in English, he would like to speak to Alexa in German. So he switches the language setting to German via the Alexa app that allows him to talk to Alexa in his native tongue but access the regional skills in the U.S.\nIf you want to hear how Alexa sounds in UK-English and German, then you can do so with the nifty Echoism.io testing tool here . In addition, Amazon has provided a step-by-step guide for developers who want to build multi-language devices here .\nAt the end of the day, this expansion is another piece of the voice-activated puzzle. The Amazon Echo retains its functionality as a stand-alone device and Alexa is tweaked to sound \u2026 different.\nBut unless Amazon start to integrate regional dialects or celebrity impersonations into the AVS, I am likely to keep my Amazon Echo set to UK-English for the foreseeable future.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-11T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our\nFeb. 16, 2017, 1:45 PM\nBI Intelligence\nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here .\nSmart home speakers like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home have been thus far positioned as novelty personal assistants, but this could soon change. The Wall Street Journal reports that both Amazon and Google are looking to integrate a voice-calling feature to the speakers, adding valuable functionality for users and giving the tech giants more insight into users' home lives.\nIf the companies manage to launch the feature, it would impact not just the smart home experience, but the mobile one as well.\nThe companies' strategies for integrating such a feature remain unclear, but it's likely that users' existing mobile devices will need to be linked to their smart home speakers. There are two possible strategies on the table for bringing mobile connectivity to smartphones \u2014 one involves giving each device a unique phone number, and the other involves connecting the smart home device to a user's existing mobile device. The latter strategy is more likely because it would open access to users' existing contacts, call records, and favorites.\nThere are a couple of implications of integrating voice calling to smart home speakers:\nIt would move smart home speakers into the essential fabric of the home. Echo products and the Google Home are currently marketed as home personal assistants, offering features like hands-free control of smart home devices and the ability to look up quick facts. But calling is a capability that's essential to the vast majority of Americans. If devices with Alexa embedded in them gain this capability, consumers would be less likely to view these devices as merely a luxury.\nIt could also increase the length of the smartphone upgrade cycle, which might, in turn, impact shipments. If consumers gain another avenue through which to make calls and send text messages, they may be less inclined to use their traditional mobile devices as frequently. A Pew survey from last year found that calls, texts, and emails comprise the vast majority of activities users perform on their mobile phones. Less usage of mobile could lead to consumers feeling less of a need to replace their smartphone as often as they currently do, subsequently impacting shipments of these devices.\nBut here are some issues that both companies and their customers could run into given the introduction of such a feature:\nCollaboration with phone companies if they want to give every device a unique phone number. If Google and Amazon want to give each individual device a unique phone number, they would likely need to work with telcos to establish plans. While Google's history of working with Verizon for devices like the Pixel phone could give it a leg up on Amazon, which hasn't worked in the mobile space extensively since the Fire phone was discontinued, both companies would need new agreements and partnerships to make this feature a reality.\nConstant speakerphone setting. To enable a calling capability, the smart home speakers would always have to be in speakerphone mode, which could be inconvenient for users. Further, users wouldn't be able to have a private phone conversation as they would with a handheld device.\nIssues with law enforcement. Law enforcement officials maintain the authority to monitor and collect phone conversations as long as they present an approved warrant. But, with these devices, it's unclear whether, legally speaking, a user is making phone call or simply speaking to their voice assistant. Further, Amazon and Google may need to change the nature of how they collect conversations on these devices, as they might be violating state laws if these conversations are deemed to be phone calls.\nPotential privacy concerns from consumers. The Echo products and the Google Home are always on \u2014 they're listening to users' conversations and other noise within range, even when Alexa or the Google Assistant aren't activated. Consumers might be hesitant to use a feature that could potentially allow these companies to monitor their phone conversations.\nThe U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption.\nThere are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home.\nJohn Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers.\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\nSmart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem.\nCurrently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the \"chasm\" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices.\nHigh prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential.\nThe largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems.\n\"Closed ecosystems\" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point.\nIn full, the report:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-16T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

According to Recode ,\u00a0Amazon is\u00a0also working on new Alexa devices that will offer phone call and intercom functionality that will allow communication between Alexa devices.\nThe new Alexa devices will pretty much work as intercom systems between other Alexa users. This means you can ask Alexa to send a message to a given person without the need of taking out a phone or typing anything. That sounds pretty cool.\ngallery\n4\nAdvertisement\nThis is meant to address the overall utility of Alexa. It\u2019s cool you can set timers and play music, but aside from that, there\u2019s not much more you can do with the Echo. This new feature might make it more appealing to use on a daily basis. The report also notes \u00a0a recent\u00a0study from VoiceLabs that said\u00a0Amazon\u2019s other move to improve Alexa\u2019s usage\u2014third-party skills (or voice apps)\u2014is being ignored by users. This was supposed to incorporate Alexa more into the daily schedule of its users, but apparently it is not happening.\nHow will it work?\nWe don\u2019t know how exactly this will work. Will you have to link your phone or contacts with the device? Or will it function by using an\u00a0Amazon account much like Apple has done with iMessage and FaceTime communication with Wi-Fi only devices? Many questions remain.\nSource:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-03T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Honest question: Is the Amazon Echo still worth buying?", "content": "CNET\nSmart Home\nHonest question: Is the Amazon Echo still worth buying?\nThe Echo Dot is a much better bargain, the now-always-listening Amazon Tap adds portability for $50 less, and new options may be coming soon. So... is the original Echo smart speaker obsolete?\nby\nThe Amazon Echo smart speaker is still a hit, but it's no longer the must-buy gadget it once was.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nI've been bullish on Alexa since Amazon first introduced the voice-activated virtual assistant back in 2014. She hasn't disappointed me. Sales of the Amazon Echo smart speaker that houses her have been strong and steady , and she now has well over 10,000 third-party voice skills at her disposal, as well as an ever-growing list of compatible smart home gadgets. Make no mistake, the Echo is a certified smash hit, and it isn't showing any signs of slowing down.\nThat said, there's never been a worse time to buy one.\nHear me out. Since the Echo's debut, Amazon has introduced two offshoot products: the pint-size Echo Dot and the battery-powered Amazon Tap (currently available in the US only). Both offer the same full slate of Alexa functionality, and both cost less than the Echo's $180 asking price (\u00a3150 in the UK).\nThe Echo is starting to get outshined by its younger siblings, the Tap and the Dot.\nChris Monroe/CNET\nThe Echo Dot and the Tap also do things that the Echo can't do. Though the Echo now lets you pair with external speakers over Bluetooth , the Echo Dot can connect with an external speaker setup via Bluetooth or via auxiliary cable, thanks to a line in jack.\nWith the battery-powered Tap, you can pick it up and take it wherever you like -- and after a recent update , you can activate it with your voice just like you can with the Echo and the Echo Dot. That essentially makes it the same product as the Echo, but with an extra portability selling point and a price tag that's fifty bucks cheaper.\nThe simple truth is that the Echo is starting to get a bit long in the tooth. Aside from the steady roll-out of skills and the addition of an \"ESP\" feature that keeps multiple units from answering you all at once, the Echo hasn't seen any major updates since its release (unless you count the fact that it's available in white now ). Compare that with the Echo Dot -- it arrived almost six months after the Echo did, yet it's already well into its second generation.\nNew hardware, like this rumored Alexa Camera, could be on its way.\nAFTVNews.com\nOn top of that, there are strong signs that we'll see new Alexa hardware from Amazon this year, including the possibility of an Alexa camera and new Alexa devices that'll add in phone call and intercom capabilities. It isn't hard to think of other features that a second-gen Echo could bring to the table, either. Unprompted Alexa notifications have already been bandied about, and many are holding out hope for a way to sync multiple devices up for whole-home audio playback.\nAll of that is to say nothing of the competition (or for that matter, of third party Alexa gadgets like Triby and Fabriq ). The Google Home smart speaker is one viable alternative that's already available, and another big one might be on the way if you believe rumors of a Siri-powered Echo competitor from Apple .\nTo be clear, Alexa is still a dominant market mover, and that isn't likely to change any time soon. But if you haven't picked up an Echo yet and you're tempted to do so now, consider waiting, or settling instead on a Tap or an Echo Dot. For now, both feel like much better choices.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Updated at 12:07 PM EST on 3/13/17 to reflect that the Echo can now connect with external speakers via Bluetooth.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-13T19:07:00Z", "images": []}

Instead, the company claims the service is \u201cfundamentally different,\u201d offering a \u201cdeeper experience\u201d by serving as a guide to customers\u2019 phones, having the capability to support nearly all tasks that can be performed through Bixby-enabled apps.\nSamsung says that new devices will feature a dedicated Bixby button on the side. The company believes this will alleviate confusion on how to activate the system.\nFor example, the company says in a blog post, instead of taking \u201cmultiple steps to make a call \u2013 turning on and unlocking the phone, looking for the phone application, clicking on the contact bar to search for the person that you\u2019re trying to call and pressing the phone icon to start dialing \u2013 you will be able to do all these steps with one push of the Bixby button and a simple command.\u201d\nAs for using Bixby within apps, users will be able to call on the assistant at any time. Once Bixby is activated, it will then understand the current context and state of the application and will be able to carry out the current work-in-progress continuously.\nSamsung adds that over time, Bixby will be \u201csmart enough\u201d to understand commands with incomplete information and execute the tasks, meaning you won\u2019t have to memorize a specific commands to use the service.\n\u201cBixby is the heart of our software and services evolution as a company,\u201d Samsung said, adding that the service will eventually expand to other appliances from the company, including air conditioners and televisions.\nFor now, the company says that when the Galaxy S8 launches it will come with several pre-installed apps that will work with Bixby.\nWant more consumer news?

Bixby is an agent that can help the smartphones talk, recommend, and remind, said Mok Oh, vice president of service strategy at Samsung.\nThe AI service is being positioned as a more intuitive way to use and interact with smartphones.

It's also not a replacement for S Voice, which won't be present on S8 and S8+ but will live on in Tizen devices.\nSamsung plans to \"Bixby-enable\" other devices, such as appliances made by the company, though it is unclear when that will happen, said Werner Goertz, research director at Gartner.\nThere is a dedicated Bixby button on the smartphones. Samsung didn't provide a chance to test Bixby\u00a0and didn't say when the AI service would come on the new smartphones. It could be available on the smartphones as early as April 21, when the S8 handsets ship, or be pushed out in a software update.

That's what Samsung is aiming for with Bixby.\nGive the smartphone a command -- like to take a selfie, launch the photo gallery app, or to make a phone call -- and the device will be able to decipher it. You can speak out a command in multiple ways, and Bixby will understand it.\nImage recognition\nThe Galaxy S8 smartphones will be able to take pictures, identify objects, and provide context to the images. Samsung provided the example of Bixby recognizing the Flatiron building in New York City and then providing recommendations on places to eat nearby.\nThis feature is also being linked closely to shopping -- users can take an image of a product and post it on Pinterest, which is partnering with Samsung. Users will also be able to take picture of a product and check pricing, shop, or see recommendations of the products from sites of retail partners.\nLanguage translation\nSamsung provided an intriguing example of Bixby being able to take a picture of text and translate it into different languages. Samsung didn't demonstrate how it worked, so there's no clear sense yet of how this will happen. Bixby supports 52 languages, but the service isn't based on Samsung's homegrown technology. Instead, the company using a partner\u00a0to provide this service. Samsung's Oh didn't provide the name of the partner and didn't say if the company was also using a backend service like Google Translate for the capability.\nLearn more about users over time\nOver time, Bixby will learn about smartphone usage patterns and anticipate user needs. That feature will manifest in the form of the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphones organizing and displaying \"cards\" based on anticipated actions.\nFor example, in the morning you may automatically see news and weather information, or Bixby may help fire up Uber to contact a cab to take you to work.

Do you think that we\u2019re fooled, giant, powerful technology companies? We see you there, lurking behind your jolly masks. Anyway, here\u2019s the 2017 installment of this collective exercise in well-choreographed image management. Enjoy.\nThe iFixit micro toolkit\nThe specialist tools that iFixit uses for its widely watched teardowns of most major smartphone and tablet releases are neat, without question \u2013 so here\u2019s a teeny little set of them, meant for use by hamsters. No, really. Watch the video.\nPersonally, I think these could have been smaller. Soon we\u2019re definitely going to have pet wearables, and how will we take those apart without microscopic spudgers and screwdrivers?\nThe T-Mobile ONEsie\nYep, it\u2019s a connected onesie, using body heat and movement to keep your phone charged, track your biometrics, and provide improved coverage for you and anybody nearby. We at Network World have ragged on John Legere in the past, but full props to him for getting into the ONEsie.\nThe essence of a good April Fool\u2019s bit is commitment, and T-Mobile did a great job here, with not one but two professionally produced video promos. It helps that the ONEsie is completely ridiculous to look at.\nNetflix Live\nYou had us at Will Arnett. Seriously. It\u2019s literally just 48 minutes of Will Arnett watching stock footage and making loopy comments on it in that crazy low voice of his. Go watch it immediately. Who doesn\u2019t have a Netflix subscription these days, anyway?\nAn overlooked Netflix fact is that the streaming service has a lot of low-key weird content available these days \u2013 including stuff like a full-length train journey through Norway and something called \u201cnational firewood night,\u201d which is just six hours of the camera staring at a fire.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\nLyft Mono\nKinder, friendlier ridesharing service Lyft rolled out the \u201cMono,\u201d a piece of hardware that looks a lot like a hitchhiker\u2019s thumb that you can use to hail a Lyft just by sticking it in the air.\n\u201cHail Yes,\u201d and \u201cBe Unopposable\u201d are very good taglines, for the record, and the production makes this look strangely like a product you\u2019d wear over your T-Mobile ONEsie, if you wanted to look like a walking guerilla marketing campaign for Pepto Bismol.\nReddit Place\nOh, Reddit. What can\u2019t you turn into a massive, crowd-powered ball of weirdness? This isn\u2019t exactly a prank or joke, but it\u2019s certainly strange and unusual.\nHere\u2019s the deal \u2013 you can place pixels on a giant grid to create artwork in collaboration with other Redditors. You will be stunned \u2013 STUNNED \u2013 to learn that has mostly resulted in national flags, video game references, and dopey memery (see image at top of this story).\nBut individual subreddits have done strong prank work on their own \u2013 r/baseball changed everybody\u2019s flair into something likely to insult their favored team and appended silly extra lines to the end of every comment, for example.\nPetlexa\nYep, it\u2019s Alexa for your pets. The video\u2019s pretty funny, even if it\u2019s missing the most interesting potential use cases, like figuring out exactly what in the hell our cat is thinking when she charges headlong onto the bed when we\u2019re trying to make it and sits there purring like \u201cI\u2019m helping!\u201d\nPets were something of a theme this year, as Google did a pet-related gag as well. We like Petlexa \u2013 and another pet entry farther down our list \u2013 better.\nHonda emoji horn\nSo, obviously, this is horn sounds tailored to different emotions that you may want to express while driving a car \u2013 the smiley face plays a jaunty little tune, the laughing one has little parps of laughter, and so on.\nIt all sounds kind of like amused robots chatting to us. As Network World is based near Boston, we think the available range of emotions needs to be focused a little bit more. Where is the \u201cmotorcyclist weaving through Storrow Drive traffic\u201d button, for instance? (That one would be a combination of concern, alarm and irritation.)\nRoku SnackSuggest\nRoku\u2019s streaming services will now come with snacking suggestions , \u201clike fine wine and cheese pairings,\u201d according to the company. The sample suggestions are mutton, chicken wings and ale for Game of Thrones, garlic fries and red velvet cupcakes for Vampire Diaries, and so on.

Every tech heavyweight is investing in these assistants because they're heralded as the future of how we'll interact with our gadgets.\nBixby is one of the marquee features of Samsung's latest flagship phone, and the company is touting it as a more personalized search tool for the device. The Korean consumer electronics giant is banking that positive reception for the Galaxy S8, which sports a sleek design that sheds the home button and slims down the frame for a larger display in a more compact body, will wipe away the bitter taste left from the Galaxy Note 7 incident .\nIt's unclear how the loss of Bixby at launch will affect sales, since voice assistants don't rank as high for consumers pondering a new phone as other factors such as battery life and camera quality. Samsung said preorders for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are up double-digits from the early orders for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.\nBixby Voice won't be on the launch version in the UK either. \"All Bixby functionality, bar the Voice Function, will be available to UK customers at launch. Bixby Voice will be available in US English later this spring, and will expand to more languages globally over time,\" a Samsung spokesperson in the UK said in a statement.\nLikewise, Australians will also need to wait for Samsung's virtual assistant. At the Australian launch of the S8 and S8 Plus, Samsung said Bixby Voice would be coming to Australia \"in the coming months.\" Richard Fink, VP, IT & Mobile Division, Samsung Australia, said that Samsung was working with local language experts to ensure Bixby would be a good experience for Aussies.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-11T11:55:00Z", "images": []}

It was announced in a blog on March 20, nine days before the phone's launch, by Injong Rhee, executive vice president of software and services for Samsung Electronics.\nRhee pointed out a physical button on the side of the phone that would activate Bixby, differentiating it from Alexa or Siri and others that are activated by a spoken trigger word. Bixby would offer a \"deeper experience\" than some others, including support for touch commands. Also, Bixby is designed to know the current state of an app to allow users to carry out work in progress without further explanation. Rhee said the Bixby interface is \"much more natural and easier to use.\"\nBixby was already two years behind those digital assistants as well as Google Assistant, analysts said. \"Bixby is going to be playing catch up,\" said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz in March.\nOne analyst forgave the Bixby delay. \"I commend Samsung for trying to get it right rather than just launching and hoping for the best,\" said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates.\n\"It's never a good idea to put out less than great software on a consumer device. So in this case, if Samsung can delay a few weeks and get a better product, it makes sense to do so. That said, voice recognition generally is not all that easy to do. It's not just the recognition software itself, but the whole voice chain that has to be tailored. That includes everything from the microphone through the audio channel on the phone to the recognition algorithms and the user interface. If they tested and it wasn't at their expected level of accuracy, then it's better to get it right than to get it out fast.\"\nOn Wendesday, Goertz agreed with Gold. \"Yes, the delay is disappointing \u2026 but Samsung's postponement of Bixby voice is still better than launching a virtual personal assistant that is not entirely ready for prime time.\"\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-13T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Apple made a huge mistake when it decided not to take on Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation", "content": "Apple made a huge mistake when it decided not to take on Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation\nKif Leswing\nApple/Business Insider\nThe Apple TV is one of Apple\u2019s most perplexing products. Its design is lacking, its content is undistinguished, and much of its software, like the TV app or the iPhone remote, seems unfinished.\nBloomberg ace Mark Gurman wrote on Thursday about the current Apple TV\u2019s development process, and how the vision for the product has been scaled back over and over again. \u201cI signed up for revolutionary. We got evolutionary,\u201d an Apple source told him.\nBut the most interesting detail to me was that Apple had considered bundling a game controller with its $US160 TV computer, which would have allowed the company to chip away at the console gaming industry the same way the iPhone has chipped away at the handheld gaming market.\nFrom Bloomberg:\n\u201cEarly on, the Apple TV was going to replace the clunky set-top boxes from the cable companies and stream live television. It never happened. The team debated bundling a gaming controller with the current model to better compete with Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Xbox and Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation. That didn\u2019t happen either.\u201d\nAnd:\n\u201cTo a certain extent, the Apple TV is handcuffed by its parent\u2019s addiction to fat margins. Apple is constitutionally allergic to losing money on a product \u2014 even if it can make up the difference by selling content\u2026 Likewise, not bundling a gaming controller was partially a cost-driven decision.\u201d\nWhen Apple launched the most recent version of the Apple TV, it added the ability to pair an Apple-approved Bluetooth controller with the streaming box. However, Apple does not make a Bluetooth game controller \u2014 people had to choose from licensed third-party options, which were priced around $US60.\nA few game developers took advantage of the new controller settings at first, but not many, especially because it would require extra work to support a controller with an uncertain install base. And the Apple TV remote does not provide the same experience as a dedicated game controller.\nApple is fond of the slogan: \u201c The future of TV is apps. \u201c\nBut it turns out, in the present, that most of the best-selling and highest-grossing apps on Apple\u2019s app stores are games. According to App Annie, 75% of of apps revenue for iPhones and iPads were games in 2015.\nAs of January, only 10 of the top 30 grossing apps are non-gaming, and going back to the end of 2013, only two of these were even in the top 50, according to research from Macquarie\u2019s Ben Schachter.\nSo if Apple really wanted to have a healthy developer community around its TV operating system, it should have given games developers a reason to build games for it \u2014 like that game makers could count on Apple TV users having a traditional gaming input.\nI previously asked someone with knowledge of Apple\u2019s strategy why Apple didn\u2019t emphasis the gaming abilities of the Apple TV, and they said that Apple didn\u2019t want to be compared to Xbox or Playstation, which are gaming focused.\nBut Apple could have \u201cdisrupted\u201d the console industry the same way it took over the mobile gaming world \u2014 by offering a limited version for cheaper, building up a large number of developers, and eventually directly challenging the established market as technology gets better and faster.\n\u2018The assets that we have in this area are huge\u2019\nApple\nApple TV-compatible controller.\nIt all goes back to Apple \u201c trying to change its story .\u201d In recent months, Apple leadership has pointed to its services revenue \u2014 mostly the cut it takes when someone buys an app from the App Store \u2014 as a way to offset lower margins and also as a second firehose of profit.\nBut as Gurman reports, Apple loves its fat margins. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always made its money \u2014 selling premium hardware at a premium price.\nBut that strategy doesn\u2019t seem to be working for TV. The same content is generally available on Amazon and Roku, which are Apple TV\u2019s primary competitors, and which sell their devices for a much lower price.\nCompetition is hurting Apple TV \u2014 last quarter, its sales were down year-over-year, Apple\u2019s CFO admitted .\nSo Apple TV needs a way to differentiate itself, or at least justify its higher price. And if a \u201cskinny bundle\u201d or getting exclusive TV shows like \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d is tough, maybe Apple needs to think of its TV computer in a different way.\nTurning the Apple TV into a cheaper version of a game console with a bundled controller would have emphasised Apple\u2019s strengths \u2014 its hardware design and developer community \u2014 while only wiping out some margin that was not moving the needle for the $US700 billion company anyway.\nThis is an opinion column.

One\u00a0new chipset from Qualcomm could help fill that gap.\nThe QCA4020 chipset packs in Bluetooth Low Energy 5, ZigBee 3.0, WiFi 802.11n, and OpenThread wireless communications protocols.\nThe chipset is like a mini-developer board -- an integrated chipset with an ARM-based CPU. It can be used to create smart home or industrial devices.\n[ Now read 20 hot jobs ambitious IT pros should shoot for . ]\nIt can also serve as a wireless access point for Raspberry Pi and other developer boards used to make smart gadgets, drones, robots, and industrial devices.\u00a0It has a number of connector protocols\u00a0and can work with Arduino boards.\nIt'll work right out of the box, and gadget development is easy, said\u00a0Joseph Bousaba, vice president of product management at Qualcomm.\nThe chipset can talk with devices based on Apple HomeKit, Windows 10 IoT Core, and other software stacks.\n\"We are trying to make it as simple as possible to connect no matter what the radio is,\" Bousaba said.\u00a0\n[ Get certified as an Apple Technical Coordinator with this seven-part online course from PluralSight. ]\nA unique feature allows the QCA4020 to open\u00a0simultaneous communication channels so a gadget can broadcast data to multiple devices using different wireless technologies.\nIt can also work with multiple cloud solutions like Amazon's AWS, Alibaba, and Microsoft Azure. Qualcomm provides a software-based \"cloud agent\" that acts as an interface to connect to these cloud services, Bousaba said.\nThe product announcement comes ahead of Mobile World Congress, where Qualcomm will demonstrate its latest wireless technologies and chips like the Snapdragon 835. The chipset will ship internationally, though specifics about the country, date, and price will become available in the coming weeks.\nThe QCA4020 is one of the first development micro-boards based on new Bluetooth 5 protocol, which is two times faster and has quadruple the range of Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 can transfer data at speeds of up to 2Mbps (bits per second) and has a range of more than 100 meters.\nOne of the advantages of Bluetooth 5 is its ability to operate a mesh of devices, with the ability to broadcast data from one device to many. That helps implement an entire network of smart home devices communicating in real time, Bousaba said.\nThat wasn't possible with previous versions of Bluetooth, Bousaba said.\nFor example, once a user enters a home, a Bluetooth 5 digital lock can transmit data simultaneously to switch on the smart lights and heating system.\nThe QCA4020 chipset\u00a0is also one of the few boards supporting OpenThread, which is an open-source take on Google's emerging Thread protocol. It is an adaptation from ZigBee, with a software stack that enables IP-based communication capabilities.\nThe QCA4020 has an integrated Cortex-M4 processor operating at 150Mhz, making it similar to Texas Instruments' $29 Launchpad Board \u00a0and Nordic's nRF52840 Preview Development Kit , both of which have Bluetooth 5. But those boards don't include the wide range of radios like on Qualcomm's chipset.\nJoin the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-21T09:30:00Z", "images": []}

Its bug bounty program is also offering rewards for zero-day vulnerabilities relating to Google Chrome and Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser.\nExodus Intelligence isn\u2019t the only private security firm to offer a high bounty for bugs.

But the ARM share price went up 15 per cent, so how could we be taking advantage? We are looking at a long-term investment.'\nRELATED ARTICLES\nShare this article\nShare\nThe Brexit camp was quick to pounce on the takeover as evidence the UK remains attractive to overseas investors.\nSon claims he didn't think about it much either way. Perhaps he is too canny to risk annoying a large chunk of the British population by expressing a view.\n'I think Brexit is a very complicated situation. I am one of the few people who says: 'I don't know, I don't care.'\n'What I believe in is hundreds of years of the British people's intelligence and their hard work.

Robots will allow humans to live lives of unimaginable luxury and machines will be more intelligent than people within 40 years.\nThe tycoon was born in 1957 into a poor family in a small town on Kyushu Island, the southernmost of the four islands of Japan. His father raised pigs and illegally made sake, the fiery Japanese wine, to supplement the household income.\nSon's fascination with technology took hold in adolescence. In the mid-seventies, he even slept with a magnified photograph of a computer chip developed by Intel under his pillow, because he loved the design so much.\nDespite his intelligence, he felt Japanese people looked down on him because he has a Korean heritage and name \u2013 a factor, perhaps, in fuelling the outsider mentality that led him to become an entrepreneur rather than just another salaryman.\nAt 16, he moved to the US where he stayed with relatives and went to the University of California, Berkeley.\nLike many an aspiring young inventor, he wrote down his ideas in a notebook. Unlike most teenage brainboxes, he sold the patent for one of them, an electronic translator, for nearly $1million to Sharp.\nThat precocious coup sent him on the route to becoming one of the world's richest men, with a fortune now estimated at around \u00a310billion.\nAt the tender age of 19, he had mapped a 50-year business plan. By 2010, aged 52, he had drawn up a plan for the next 300 years.\nThat blueprint includes investing in 5,000 companies by 2040, by which time he will be in his eighties. If it all goes according to the script, there will be plenty more deals after ARM.\nThe core of his empire is SoftBank, which despite the name is not a bank but a global technology giant.\nHe set up the business in 1981, after heading back from the US to Japan with his wife Masami Ohno.\nIt was driven by necessity as much as ambition. The newly-weds, who met at university, had no money coming in and Masami was pregnant with the first of their two daughters.\nIf she was worried, she needn't have been. By 1994 her husband was a billionaire.\nUS home: Son is understood to have paid \u00a390m for this nine-acre Silicon Valley mansion\nHowever he went on to lose a fortune in the dotcom crash of the early noughties. Since then Son has rebuilt his fortune. His investments include a \u00a338billion stake in Chinese shopping website Alibaba \u2013 which he bought in 2000 for a bargain \u00a312million \u2013 and he owns the Japanese arm of mobile phone group Vodafone.\nNot everything has worked out as planned. He bought a 77 per cent\u00a0holding three years ago in US internet telecoms firm Sprint, but losses continue to rack up and it is groaning under \u00a325 per cent\u00a0of borrowings.\nEyebrows have been raised in the Square Mile over the total debt across the Son empire \u2013 around \u00a385billion \u2013 though he is untroubled.\nIn any case, he reckons money isn't everything. SoftBank is valued at \u00a354billion on the Japanese stock market but its website quixotically claims it is there not just to make profits but to contribute to 'people's happiness and joy'.\nSon himself is capable of generous gestures. In 2011 he gave his \u00a390million pay package \u2013 and donated his basic salary of just over \u00a3980,000 a year until retirement \u2013 to earthquake and tsunami victims.\nHe can, of course, afford it. Not long after, he was reported to have paid \u00a390million for a nine-acre Silicon Valley mansion.\u00a0\nTalks: Son leaves Downing Street with ARM chairman Stuart Chambers last month\nThe white, neoclassical pile in wealthy Woodside, with a domed entrance hall and pool, set in a hilltop estate, was in 2013 said to be the most expensive US house sale on record.\nSoftBank's latest eye-catching venture is the development of a robot called the Pepper, which can apparently read human emotions.\nSome 10,000 of the robots, which cost Japanese buyers about \u00a31,300 not counting maintenance, insurance and running costs, have been sold.\u00a0\nThe humanoids, which are capable of holding conversations and of moving independently, have proved extremely popular.\nMore than a thousand companies are using them for tasks such as selling coffee and working as hotel receptionists.\nBut there are limits to the tasks they will perform: the user agreement warns owners they must not install their 4ft tall metal companions with salacious or violent apps.\nARM's technology is largely invisible to consumers but its chip designs power most of the world's smartphones. It is perfectly placed to profit from the 'internet of things' \u2013 intelligent devices such as street lamps that switch on when a car approaches or fridges that will automatically order milk when you're about to run out.\nSon says he had been watching ARM for a decade, but once he had made up his mind to launch a bid he did so at warp speed.\nHe called ARM chairman Stuart Chambers, who was in the middle of a sailing holiday off the coast of Turkey, then flew to Istanbul airport by private jet, flanked by armed security guards.\nThe pair met and hammered out the outline of a deal at the Pineapple restaurant on the waterfront at the seaside resort of Marmaris.\nLess than a fortnight later, Son, who spent several days installed in a suite in the Berkeley Hotel in London's Knightsbridge, had launched his bid for the British firm. He says that unlike other foreign buyers \u2013 such as Kraft, which took over Cadbury \u2013 he wants to invest in the company and create hundreds of new jobs in Britain.\nARM currently employs 4,000 people worldwide, of which 1,700 are in the UK, most of them in Cambridge. Son has committed to double the number in the UK.\nUp to 100 people working for SoftBank may be shipped over here as part of that agreement and it is not clear whether any existing ARM staff will lose their jobs.\nHe has also pledged to keep ARM's headquarters in the UK and to increase the funding, though he won't say by how much.\nHe says: 'We will sign a legally binding contract and provide that to the Takeover Panel and the UK courts so they will have an enforceable power to make it happen.' Accountant Grant Thornton will act as an independent monitor.\n'Anyone who knows me knows my promise is as good as a contract,' he says. 'I am doing this because not everyone in Britain knows me.\n'I want to create an ecosystem of start-ups around Cambridge. It can be like Silicon Valley, and that will be a good thing for Britain \u2013 I want to make Britain proud. I really believe ARM can be bigger than Google or Facebook, if we invest and take the opportunities.'\nBritain has so far not managed to produce a world-beating technology company.\nWe now have to hope Son will be true to his word and that a quirky Japanese billionaire can succeed where our best brains have failed.\nEDITOR'S DEALS OF THE WEEK\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-08-10T20:56:17Z", "images": []}

{"title": "The worst thing about the iPhone 7 might be the iPhone 7 Plus", "content": "Tweet\nIt took Apple many years to finally come around and embrace the phablet market with\u00a0larger iPhone\u00a0models, and when it did it launched two distinct iPhones. For the first time in the history of the iPhone, Apple unveiled two new models\u00a0at the same time in September 2014, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, following the exact same recipe in 2015. This year, the company is also expected to have two brand new smartphones in stores come September \u2013 though until recently, Apple may have considered launching three distinct devices .\nHowever, there\u2019s one huge change coming to the new iPhone this year that will annoy plenty of longtime Apple fans.\nDON\u2019T MISS:\u00a0 Everything new in iOS 10 beta 5 and iOS 10 public beta 4\nA new report this week\u00a0detailed some of the hot new features coming in\u00a0the iPhone 7. Even though the device will keep the design of the iPhone 6 virtually unchanged, it\u2019ll have some interesting new tricks up its sleeve. The rear camera is getting a huge update, for example\u2026 but only if you get the right model.\n\u201cThe dual cameras on the larger new iPhone will produce brighter photos with more detail, according to a person who has used a prototype version of the upcoming device,\u201d Bloomberg reported earlier this week . \u201cBoth sensors, which each capture color differently, simultaneously take a picture, and the device produces a single, merged photograph, said the person.\u201d\n\u201cThe dual system sharpens photos taken in low-light environments, the person said,\u201d the report continued. \u201cThe combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows users to zoom while retaining more clarity, the person added. The smaller version of the new phones will not include dual lenses, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year.\u201d\nFor the first time since 2014, the two iPhones coming in September will not be alike. They\u2019ll share most of the same specs, but the camera on the back\u00a0of the iPhone 7 Plus promises to be vastly superior to the one on the iPhone 7. Moreover, reports said the iPhone 7 Plus may\u00a0receive a bump in RAM to handle the dual rear cameras.\nLooking at early iPhone 7 rumors, I already concluded that Apple is going to\u00a0force me\u00a0 to buy a new iPhone that I don\u2019t really want \u00a0this year. And it looks like I might not be the only person who doesn\u2019t appreciate these rumors.\n\u201cIt sounds like the plus-sized iPhone really will be the only model with the dual lens camera. Depressing if true,\u201d Apple fan John Gruber concluded , after reading the same Bloomberg report .\nThe worst thing about the iPhone 7 will be the iPhone 7 Plus is that the 4.7-inch model won\u2019t be the best iPhone Apple can offer, especially when it comes to camera performance \u2014 which is one of the iPhone features Apple values most. That\u2019s something that didn\u2019t happen in previous years when the only thing that separated the two devices was optical image stabilization on the phablet model.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-08-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

MagSpoof is an open-source application that lets users spoof magnetic stripe codes. \"According to Samsung statement this transaction had to be declined. But it went through.\"\n\"They are not addressing the main problem,\" Mendoza told CSO Online.\nIn particular, the fact that an attack is difficult is not a particular barrier in a world where criminals routinely package and sell ready-to-go exploits to one another.\n\"An attacker has to prepare a complete scenario to be successful,\" he said. \"But that does not mean that it is complex or expensive. Basically, each tool that I made costs around $50. So many people with computer science knowledge could make something similar.\"\nALSO ON CSO: 7 ways to prevent mobile break-in\nHe added that he notified Samsung about the issue in May, and the company asked him for more details about the vulnerability.\n\"The communication was fluent and adequate,\" he said. \"After many emails, I sent my presentation a couple of weeks before Black Hat. But after that, they did not respond any more related to the issues.\"\nWhat this shows is that Samsung is like every other company on Earth, which is fallible.\nJonathan Sander, vice president of product strategy at Lieberman Software\n\"I've seen Mendoza's research, and watched the videos, and it seems like he's got a pretty airtight case, that's for sure,\" said security expert Jonathan Sander, vice president of product strategy at Lieberman Software.\nThe main problem seems to be that the tokens generated by Samsung Pay are, to some degree, sequential, making it possible to predict future tokens.\n\"I feel empathy for Samsung,\" he added. \"Clearly they have done a lot to wrap this in secure layers. They might have committed an error along the way, the sequential thing, but they clearly took a lot of effort to protect it with many layers of protection and authentication. What this shows is that Samsung is like every other company on Earth, which is fallible.\"\nThe initial reaction to downplay the vulnerability is a typical public relations move, he added.\n\"You get some kind of breach, you get the first carpet-bomb marketing reply, and a week later a more detailed reply with a mea culpa and some sort of fix,\" he said. \"Essentially, they're stalling for time, while they figure out how to fix this vulnerability.\"\nHe added that Samsung may be under additional pressure because of its low market share in the mobile payments space.\nIn late July, Apple announced that its Apple Pay platform accounts for three quarter of all contactless payment transactions, leaving just 25 percent for Samsung Pay and Google's Android Pay.\nRELATED VIDEO:\nThis story, \"Samsung both denies and admits mobile payment vulnerability\" was originally published by CSO\n.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-08-11T09:47:00Z", "images": []}

The MacBook Pros aren\u2019t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone.\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a \u201cpost-PC\u201d device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience.\nSales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6% to $25.5bn (\u20ac23bn) in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23% to $23.2bn.\nThis year\u2019s MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads.\nApple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen.\nThe most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row.\nInstead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application.\nThe smaller display will use Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, a thinner screen technology, KGI Securities said earlier this year.\n\u00a9 Irish Examiner Ltd.

{"title": "Apple is planning MacBook Pro overhaul, the first in four years\u2014 Report - New York Business Journal", "content": "Aug 10, 2016, 3:00pm EDT\nApple will overhaul the MacBook Pro for the first time in four years.\nThe new laptop will be thinner, include a touchscreen strip for function keys and offer more powerful graphics processors for professional users and gamers, according to Bloomberg , citing sources close to the situation. The new computers are in advanced testing within the company. The release date is unknown, but it is unlikely the device will be ready for the Apple next-generation iPhone launch event scheduled on Sept. 7.\nThe most striking feature update will be the new display above the keyboard, which will replace the standard-function key row. Instead of keys marked F1-F12, there will be a screen that employs Organic Light-Emitting Diodes and offers functions that apply directly to the user\u2019s task or application. For example, the display would show media controls while iTunes is in use or editing commands while iMovie is open. Apple could add new buttons through software updates.\nBuyers will also have an option for a graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices, according to the report. AMD\u2019s new graphics card is 20 percent thinner than its current version. It is unknown which provider Apple will use for the main processor, although Intel has supplied this element in the past.\nThe new MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than Apple\u2019s current laptop offerings, but they won\u2019t be tapered like the MacBook Air and the 12-inch MacBook. The trackpad will be slightly wider and Apple will also add the Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the Pro line. The fingerprint sensor would allow users to log in faster and use Apple Pay for online purchases. The laptops will encrypt fingerprint data so it can\u2019t be hacked.\nThe planned MacBook Pro upgrade comes as the Cupertino-based company is seeing a sharp decline in iPad and iPhone sales. Apple\u2019s tablet sales were down in the second quarter, shipping 10 million units this quarter compared to 11 million units at the same time last year. iPhone sales were down 8 percent during the third quarter compared with the same period last year. However, sales of Macs, including the Pro line, were up 6 percent to $25.5 billion in the last fiscal year, per Bloomberg.\nDuring the last quarter, Apple said net income was $7.8 billion in the quarter that ended June 25, down from $10.68 billion one year ago. Revenue also declined 14 percent to $42.36 billion compared with $49.6 billion last year.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-08-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Combing through confidential government records and a swath of interviews, Barboza explores\u00a0the complexities\u00a0technology companies like Apple have to go through to make\u00a0manufacturing a success overseas. At the same time, the piece highlights the difficulties companies will encounter when attempting to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.\nBarboza\u2019s investigative piece delves deep into the city\u00a0of Zhengzhou that\u00a0locals have now dubbed \u2018iPhone City\u2019. The city, in one of China\u2019s poorest regions, produces half of the world\u2019s iPhones at a\u00a0 Foxconn facility.\nRunning at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner\u00a0 Foxconn , can produce 500,000 iPhones a day.\nExploring\u00a0past just the factories we commonly know,\u00a0Barboza tells\u00a0the story of how incentives and government play a significant role for technology companies in the region.\nBeijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules.\nThe years of work and investment developing the supply chain\u00a0overseas can make bringing manufacturing back stateside near impossible. Foxconn has brought the idea of potentially moving a portion of their operations to the US, but not all of Apple\u2019s other supply chain manufacturers have. With President-Elect Donald J. Trump promising punitive tariffs on companies that move jobs overseas, Apple\u2019s years of relationship building in China are notable to say the least.\u00a0These deals with government agencies and various companies have allowed\u00a0Apple to remain as profitable as possible.\nA 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.\nBarboza\u2019s reporting shows that although consumers may just see the end product of the newest Apple gadget, the years it took to arrive to that point are full of stories unto themselves. For example, the relationship that had started with Foxconn during the original iPod sales\u00a0has become\u00a0a significant contributor in Apple\u2019s strength in China until today.\nWhen Apple\u2019s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn\u2019s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers.\nFoxconn\u2019s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones.\n\u201cThe reason Foxconn\u2019s so big is Terry Gou,\u201d said Tony Fadell , a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. \u201cHe said he\u2019d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.\u201d\nThe entire piece makes for a great read in understanding not only how Apple has operated within the country, but how even some of it\u2019s competitors like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Samsung have too.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-12-29T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Currently slated for April , a new rumor (via David Ruddock ) corroborates several \u00a0earlier reports that\u00a0the Galaxy S8 is finally removing capacitive buttons\u00a0for software navigation keys.\nTwo capacitive keys flanking a home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor have been a long stalwart of Samsung\u2019s phone and\u00a0tablet design. Besides a\u00a0notable UX departure, the change reportedly results in a very \u201ctiny\u201d\u00a0bottom bezel.

{"title": "Windows 10 could get a \u2018Game Mode\u2019 that focuses your rig\u2019s processing resources on gaming", "content": "GamesBeat Summit: April 23 - 24\nToday\u2019s average gaming PC is more powerful than a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One, but chances are that you probably also have several pieces of software taking up your processing power on your computer while you game. But Microsoft may have something in the works that could fix that.\nThe latest version of Windows 10 from Microsoft includes a dormant feature called \u201cGame Mode\u201d that will shift your PC\u2019s CPU and GPU to prioritize the game over everything else (as first spotted by Twitter user h0x0d , who has uncovered Windows features before). By allocating resources away from background apps, games should perform\u00a0better than when they are sharing compute cycles with Apple\u2019s software update tool or whatever the hell else is running on your machine.\nI\u2019ve asked Microsoft for a comment about this possible upcoming feature, and we\u2019ll update this story with any new information.\n. @h0x0d looks like Windows will adjust its resource allocation logic (for CPU/Gfx etc.) to prioritize the \"Game\" when running in \"Game Mode\"\n\u2014 WalkingCat (@h0x0d) December 28, 2016\nA Game Mode on PC should behave a lot like Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One console. That system runs on the same OS kernel as Windows 10, and it already has a feature that gives almost all of the CPU and GPU power to active games. This maximizes the performance so that the Xbox One can have a smooth framerate and high resolution, but it also means that it can take the Xbox One extra time to return back to its main menu and to pull up other apps.\nIt\u2019s likely that in Game Mode, Windows 10 will help games look and run better, but it will cause similar sluggishness in returning to Windows 10 proper or switching to other apps. Hopefully, Microsoft will build in a whitelist so you can choose to leave other crucial apps, like Steam or Discord, unaffected. But yeah, go ahead, please take resources away from the Apple updater. I don\u2019t care to ever update iTunes again.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-12-28T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple sales dominate the US holiday shopping season; double that of Samsung", "content": "Neowin\nBy Steven Parker CEO - Neowin.net Neowin @RealSteveParker \u00b7\nDec 29, 2016 09:18 EST\n\u00b7 Hot! with 66 comments\nYou might think that the headline of this article is a no-brainer due to Samsung's very awful year, thanks in no small part to the Galaxy Note7 fiasco. However, according to Flurry Analytics, while Apple dominated the holiday shopping season with an overall 44% of new activations, Samsung managed to chalk up 21%, up 1% from the same (Dec 19 - Dec 25) period last year .\nIn addition, holding third and fourth place for activations in the above chart are Huawei and LG , which Flurry cites as \"remarkable\", since both manufacturers don't have a single individual device within the top 35 devices activated. Their high rank is explained due to the fact that they have wide variety of devices and affordable options available, such as multiple phablet and medium phones for consumers to choose from.\nAlso notably missing from the above chart is Google, which began offering its Pixel and Pixel XL this year. Despite pre-orders for the phones opening well before the holiday season , but also maybe due to the apparent difficulty in scoring the new handsets . It appears that they haven't done enough to excite consumers, something we agreed on with our review of the Pixel XL .\nLastly, as is evident in the above chart, phablets continue to eat away at the \"Medium Phones\" pie, rising to an overall 37% of activations, a 10% jump over 2015. However, Flurry classes a phablet between the 5 and 6.9-inch range; most, if not all flagships this year shipped with a 5-inch screen or more, so that's hardly surprising. Medium phones dropped 9% but remained the largest at 45% of new activations, while full-size tablets stabilized year-on-year at 9%.\nIt's important to note that Flurry tracks new activations, not sales. Until the respective manufacturers release sales figures, it's unknown how many devices actually made it over the counter in the US this holiday season. But according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, it's been a \"great holiday\" period.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-12-29T14:18:01Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Maruti Suzuki launches Ignis with prices starting Rs 4.59 lakh", "content": "Flipboard Google Plus\nMaruti Suzuki launches Ignis with prices starting Rs 4.59 lakh\nWith Ignis, Maruti Suzuki is targeting millenials. It comes with 1.2 litre petrol and 1.3 diesel engines and automatic gear shift technology across both fuel options.\nBy\nJan 14, 2017, 12.38 AM IST\n0Comments\nMaruti Suzuki launches Ignis starting Rs 4.59 lakh\nNEW DELHI: The country\u2019s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki ( MSIL ) is looking at expanding its product offerings at the NEXA chain of dealerships by bringing in a third vehicle \u2013 premium urban compact Ignis priced between Rs 4.59 lakh and Rs 7.80 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).\nAt present, the company sells premium hatchback Baleno and cross-over utility vehicle S-Cross through the NEXA outlets. Vehicles sold through the chain currently constitute around 10% of Maruti Suzuki\u2019s overall sales. The target is to increase this to 15-17% over the next few years by beefing up the portfolio the company has on offer at its NEXA outlets.\nKenichi Ayukawa, managing director, MSIL said, \u201cNEXA, our premium automotive retail channel, now has an offering for the millennials -- IGNIS. It combines unconventional design, seamless smartphone experience with AndroidAuto and Apple CarPlay , technological supremacy with AGS on petrol and diesel, advanced safety features as standard and personalization options, making it unique on every parameter. Ignis at NEXA will help us expand our presence in the premium compact segment.\u201d\nIgnis is built on a new generation rigid platform embodying Suzuki Total Effective Control Technology (TECT) for occupant protection. The Company, along with its suppliers, has invested over Rs 950 Crore towards development of Ignis. Ignis comes with 98.5% localization\nWith the Ignis, Maruti Suzuki is targeting Indian millenials. \u201cConsumers aged less than 29 years account for 27% of all car purchases now, up from around 22% six years back. The millenials are unique in their approach and consumption pattern. They do their research online and know exactly what they want. So far, nobody has designed a car for them\u201d, explained R S Kalsi, executive director (sales & marketing), Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL).\nThe Ignis comes strapped with 1.2 litre petrol and 1.3 diesel engines. Automatic gear shift technology is available across both fuel options. Kalsi added, \u201cIgnis is an aspirational vehicle and an entry segment offering from NEXA. It is targeted at a buyer set for whom the vehicle is not going to be the first but rather a second or third car in the family. It is the first car for the millennial in the family\nMaruti Suzuki hardly had any presence in the mid segment two to three years back. They successfully brought in the Ciaz, the Baleno, the Brezza; launched the NEXA chain of dealerships and managed to create a premium-ness around their brand. The Ignis has been developed to do the same for them at the entry-level\u201d, said V G Ramakrishnan, managing partner at Avanteum Advisors LLP.\nMaruti Suzuki will produce the Ignis at its Gurugram facility. India will be the second base to manufacture the Ignis, besides Japan. The car will be produced mostly to meet domestic demand, with potential for exports to South Asia and South-East Asia later on. C V Raman, executive director (engineering) said, \u201cWe have developed the Ignis over three and a half years. The car is equipped to meet safety regulations which will come into force later next year. It is primarily meant for the domestic market but there are possibilities of exporting the Ignis to South Asia.\u201d\n0Comments\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-14T00:38:00Z", "images": []}

The company collects 30 percent of the revenue of third-party apps on its store, with the balance going to the developer, in a closed system in which Apple controls which apps can run on an iPhone, according to court records.\nApple had argued that it does not sell apps but \u201csoftware distribution services to developers,\u201d and hence cannot simultaneously be a distributor of apps to app purchasers, Circuit Judge William Fletcher wrote for the unanimous panel.\nApple\u2019s description of its role as that similar to the owner of a shopping mall that leases physical space to stores was \u201cunconvincing,\u201d as third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own stores, he added.\nThe courts have yet to address the complaints of the app purchasers, who allege that Apple prohibits app developers from selling iPhone apps through channels other than the App Store, threatening to cut off sales by any developer who violates this rule, according to court records.\nApple is also said to discourage iPhone owners from downloading unapproved apps, threatening to make iPhone warranties void if they do so.\nApple did not immediately comment on the decision.\nThe suit covers purchases of apps from 2007 to 2013 but Bloomberg quoted Mark Rifkin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, as saying that he may try to extend the proposed class action suit to include purchasers who have bought apps for the iPhone up to the present.\nApple is being sued for damages and the court is being asked to order the company to change its app store rules.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-13T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

As long as you live in Ireland.\nFor Mercedes-Benz buyers, driving on the same side of the road as the U.K. while using a different currency comes with a new perk. The company in Ireland is reducing new car prices by 10 percent because of Brexit, a move it says is designed to support distributors after the slump in the pound made U.K. imports cheaper. At 14 Irish dealerships, the top-of-the-range Mercedes-AMG GT S now costs 225,000 euros ($240,000), saving about 25,000 euros.\n\u201cLike the U.K., Ireland has right-hand drive, plus it has the euro,\u201d said Ashley Winston, who sources cars on request across the U.K. from his London base. \u201cSo Irish drivers are almost uniquely placed to take advantage of Brexit.\u201d\nIreland\u2019s historical, economic and geographical ties with the U.K. have made Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union one of its biggest ever foreign-policy challenges. Any longer-term clouds over trade and border controls at least have a short-term silver lining: Irish consumers are getting things a little cheaper after the pound fell 12 percent against the euro since the June vote.\nThe number of used private cars imported and licensed in December more than doubled to 6,357, the Irish statistics office said on Thursday. They mainly come from across the Irish Sea before being taxed and registered.\nMercedes, part of\nDaimler AG and the world\u2019s most-popular brand of luxury car last year, said decreasing prices across its model range already is helping sales in January. It\u2019s been running radio ads trying to tempt Irish drivers.\nThe price cut in \u201cresponse to Brexit \u2013- and the impact it was having on sales of new and used cars in Ireland as a consequence of the drop in the value of sterling, which in turn has increased the level of grey imports \u2013- has had a positive impact,\u201d Ciaran Allen, sales manager at Mercedes-Benz Passenger Cars in Ireland, said in an e-mail on Thursday.\nRead More: A Guide to the Year\u2019s Biggest Divorce\nIn Sligo, in the northwest of Ireland, car dealer Kevin Egan acquired the domain name Brexitcars.ie immediately after the vote to exit the EU. The site says he bought his stock at the \u201cnew, favorable sterling rates\u201d and also carries warnings about buying a car across the Irish border, such as the lack of after-sales care and issues around warranties.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that the U.K. is so much cheaper,\u201d said Egan, who employs 19 people after opening his own business following the closure of the dealership he worked in 2009. \u201cThe message was: \u2018before you go, ring us\u2019.\u201d\nPricey Macs\nIt\u2019s in contrast to what British consumers have been facing. Prices in the U.K. have been creeping up for everything from cars to computers. There was a high-profile spat between Unilever and supermarket chain Tesco Plc over the cost of a jar of marmite, a staple of British households. Then Apple Inc.\nraised the price of its Mac Pro computers by 20 percent and Sweden\u2019s Electrolux AB put up what people would have to pay for appliances.\nEven with the Mercedes price cuts, it\u2019s still more expensive to buy cars in Ireland. The Mercedes-AMG GT S costs 111,495 pounds ($136,330) in the U.K., according to the car company\u2019s\nonline catalog . In part, the difference is explained by higher tax rates in Ireland, and drivers importing cars have to pay the difference.\nStill, the Irish inquiries keep coming to Winston in London. He said his company is preparing to deliver a 75,000-pound used Volvo to a client in Dublin.\n\u201cI was despairing when the Brexit result came through,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, an Irish client said this is going to be great, you are going to get lots of business from us. He was right. Brexit hasn\u2019t been so terrible after all.\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Peter Flanagan\nPublished on\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-13T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory.\nBut that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments.\nApple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner.\nThe MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips.\nWindows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets.\nCompeting analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017.\nOne reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren't considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows.\nHoliday deals boosted PC sales in the U.S. and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices.\nLenovo's PC shipments totaled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent, maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP's shipments totaled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units.\nIn 2016, shipments of PCs totaled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-12T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Previously unveiled back in October of 2016 , Nintendo has been keeping a fairly tight lid on specific details about the console, including its specifications, capabilities, and software lineup. Now with just less than 2 months to go until the console goes on sale, Nintendo is ramping up their promotional campaigns, releasing a good deal of new details on the console, though in a very Nintendo way.\nBack when the Switch was unveiled, we learned that the handheld console would be powered by an NVIDIA SoC, NVIDIA\u2019s first console win since 2006. At the time Nintendo and NVIDIA had been very quiet on the specifications of the SoC, and while the full specifications were certain to be off the table, I had been hoping that Nintendo would open up at least a bit more on the SoC. Unfortunately, in admittedly traditional Nintendo fashion, the company has skipped right past anything involving the SoC, and I suspect we\u2019re going to be waiting for the console launch and full teardown before we get any more hard facts here.\nFor what it is worth, Eurogamer strongly believes that the underlying SoC is a Tegra X1 \u2013 NVIDIA\u2019s 20nm Cortex-A57 CPU + Maxwell GPU SoC that\u2019s also used in the NVIDIA SHIELD TV \u2013 and while I can\u2019t confirm this at this time, for the moment I don\u2019t have any reason to doubt their suspicions. Tegra X1 is ready and available in volume, and in this respect Nintendo has been conservative for quite some time. Still, it will be interesting to crack open the Switch in March to see if it\u2019s actually Tegra X1 under the hood, or if it\u2019s some sort of Nintendo-specific derivative.\nHandheld Game Console Specification Comparison\n\u00a0\n$199\n$199\nMoving on to new information, while Nintendo held off on SoC information, they have published some new information on the console as a whole. As long suspected, the Switch features a 1280x720p capacitive touch screen LCD. Though lower in resolution than comparable phones and tablets, this is a logical fit for the console giving its performance characteristics, battery life needs, and cost concerns. Nintendo\u2019s website does not specify the type of the underlying panel, though I will be surprised if it\u2019s not IPS or *VA.\nFor storage, the console will feature expandable storage. 32GB (presumably eMMC) is built in to the console, while the console can be further expanded using microSDXC cards, similar to the current-generation 3DS consoles. And as revealed in Nintendo\u2019s teaser video last year, there will also be a separate game card slot for games released on physical media.\nMeanwhile Nintendo isn\u2019t being quite as forthcoming on the underlying specifications of the console\u2019s integrated battery, but they are providing some ballpark power figures. The Switch is rated to last between 2.5 and 6.5 hours on a single charge, depending on the game, with the forthcoming Zelda game said to run for 3 hours. This is roughly comparable to the New Nintendo 3DS XL, which is rated for 3.5 to 6 hours, with the Switch having a slightly wider range (ed: though well short of the DS Lite\u2019s 8+ hours). Still, for a long trip it\u2019s clear you\u2019ll need to bring some extra power.\nThe good news here is that for the Switch, Nintendo is giving up on proprietary chargers and power connectors. The Switch will charge via a standard USB Type-C connection, so it\u2019s possible to use USB power banks with the console. Though without more details on the battery it\u2019s hard to say just how large of a power bank will be required; given the higher power consumption of a gaming console, I expect the Switch will need a larger power bank than similarly sized tablets (perhaps something iPad Pro-sized). The Switch will also come with an AC adapter (curiously, with a hardwired cable), a welcome change after Nintendo didn\u2019t include a power adapter with the New Nintendo 3DS.\nAs for the Switch\u2019s companion dock, Nintendo has previously confirmed that it would largely be a \u201cdumb\u201d device. That said, today\u2019s unveiling does confirm that it includes a single USB 3.0 Type-A port and a pair of USB 2.0 ports, the former presumably using two SuperSpeed lanes off of the Type-C connector, and the latter using the two USB 2.0 channels built-in to USB Type-C. Nintendo hasn\u2019t officially announced any USB peripherals at this time \u2013 and it will be interesting to see what does arise, since this is a portable console \u2013 though a quick straw poll around here is that we\u2019ll be disappointed if Nintendo doesn\u2019t support the GameCube adapter for the obligatory Super Smash Bros. game.\nAs an aside, this hardware revelation also gives us just enough information to figure out how Nintendo is supplying HDMI out of the Dock. Since the Switch only offers USB Type-C connectivity, there isn\u2019t a dedicated HDMI port/path coming out of the console. I had thought Nintendo might be using HDMI alt mode for USB-C , but the USB 3.0 port inside the dock rules that out since it consumes 2 of the 4 high speed lanes that HDMI alt mode needs. Instead Nintendo has to be using DisplayPort alt mode with 2 lanes, and then doing active conversion from that to HDMI. This handily explains why Eurogamer\u2019s sources point to 1080p60/4Kp30 being the maximum output of the console \u2013 this being what 2 lanes of DisplayPort 1.2 can support \u2013 and it means that the Dock is not a dumb plastic shell, but rather has some basic, active electronics in it (it\u2019s essentially Apple\u2019s USB-C Digital AV dongle with some extra features). Though this does make me wonder whether the active conversion of video signals adds any appreciable input lag.\nOtherwise, as far as hardware goes the bulk of Nintendo\u2019s focus with respect to hardware has been on the console\u2019s two detachable controllers, the Joy-Cons. Besides being the console\u2019s primary control mechanism (ed: a tablet with buttons, thank you!), the Joy-Cons are actually a lot more sophisticated than Nintendo originally let on last year. In terms of controls, each Joy-Con features the previously depicted 4 face buttons, a large shoulder button, an analog stick; also confirmed today is that on the inside, rail edge of the Joy-Cons are a pair of smaller shoulder buttons for when a single Joy-Con is used as a controller. So the Joy-Cons are essentially miniature versions of the SNES controller with an analog stick in place of the D-Pad.\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s under the hood that\u2019s particularly interesting though. As one might expect, Nintendo is sticking with motion controls. Each Joy-Con contains a gyroscope and set of accelerometers, making it roughly equivalent to the Wii remote with Motion Plus.\nBeyond that, each Joy-Con features its own special set of features. The right Joy-Con contains an NFC reader/writer for use with Nintendo\u2019s Amiibo figures, and what Nintendo is calling a \"IR motion camera,\u201d An IR camera would imply that it\u2019s the same basic functionality as the Wii Remote, which used an IR camera to orient itself relative to the IR LEDs in the console\u2019s sensor bar, however Nintendo also quickly demonstrated that the Joy-Con could measure distance and motion from a human hand facing the camera, something the Wii Remote could not do. Finally, the left Joy-Con contains what Nintendo is calling \u201cHD rumble\u201d functionality, their name for high fidelity rumbling. Given the diminutive size of the Joy-Con, coupled with Nintendo\u2019s examples, I suspect that we\u2019re looking at multiple linear actuators for vibration (similar to Apple\u2019s Taptic Engine), as opposed to traditional motors. Not too surprisingly then, a second set of Joy-Cons won\u2019t come cheap, with Nintendo listing the MSRP at $80.\nFinally, taking a brief look at the software side, retailer pre-release information has unveiled that Switch games will go for $60. This is the same price as Wii U games and $20 higher than most 3DS games. The one bit of good news here is that Nintendo has done away with region locking, so it\u2019s possible to buy and play games from any region. Launch day games will include the previously announced Zelda game, and Nintendo\u2019s new mini-game collection, 1-2-Switch.\nWrapping things up, the Switch will be receiving a world-wide release on March 3rd (coincidentally the final day of the 2017 Game Developers Conference). It will be priced at $299 in the United States, with similar regional prices elsewhere across the globe. Ahead of the launch retailers have already put up pre-order pages (and some have started taking pre-orders), including Amazon , Best Buy , and GameStop .\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-13T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory.\nBut that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments.\nApple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner.\nThe MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips.\nWindows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets.\nCompeting analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017.\nOne reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren't considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows.\nHoliday deals boosted PC sales in the U.S. and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices.\nLenovo's PC shipments totaled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent, maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP's shipments totaled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units.\nIn 2016, shipments of PCs totaled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-12T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "13-inch MacBook Pro Hands-on: Apple's lowest-end Pro is a fitting successor to the Air | MobileSyrup", "content": "22 comments\nThe MacBook Air has essentially been pushed aside by Apple, but from its ashes, rises the 13-inch MacBook Pro, a worthy, but still expensive no-frills successor to what is regarded by many as the best laptop ever made.\nThis version of Apple\u2019s new, revamped MacBook Pro line does not include the heavily touted Touch Bar , that feature is reserved for the company\u2019s two higher-end models.\nThe build\nIf you were hoping for a reimagining of the laptop akin to Microsoft\u2019s Surface line, Apple\u2019s 13-inch Pro is not for you. The new MacBook Pro features an aluminum body that\u2019s very similar to the one that encased the previous MacBook Pro, though it\u2019s 17 percent lighter and features 23 percent less volume than the previous generation of the Pro.\nIt comes in at 1.3kg (about 3lb), approximately half a pound lighter than the older 13-inch Pro. In fact, if you were to compare the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the 13-inch MacBook Air, the new version is 12 percent thinner \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t feature the same slanted body \u2014 and it\u2019s also the same exact weight. The laptop is now available in two finishes as well: Silver and Space Grey, which was dropped from the iPhone line with the 7 and 7 Plus .\nStunning display\nApple likes to tout its intricate design process with wordy acronyms and sometimes abstract concepts, and that hasn\u2019t changed with the 13-inch Pro. In fact, it\u2019s progressed to a new level, with the company claiming the Pro\u2019s display features \u201coxide TFT\u201d technology that allows it to be 30 percent more power efficient than the screen in the previous generation of devices.\nI have no idea what oxide TFT is or what it does to make the Pro\u2019s screen look better, but what I do know is that I\u2019m impressed with what I\u2019ve seen of the display so far.\nAll technical jargon aside, the Pro\u2019s screen looks great, likely because the company says it\u2019s 67 percent brighter than the previous MacBook Pro screen, allowing you to see more detail in bright ambient light conditions.\nI\u2019ve spent time browsing the internet, watching Netflix and even edited a few photos with the laptop\u2019s 2560 x 1600 pixel display.\nKeyboard and Trackpad upgrades\nSimilar to the Touch Bar featured in its high-end siblings, the low-end Pro features the\u00a0Butterfly keyboard mechanism pulled from the 12-inch MacBook. While some hate this revamped keyboard, I\u2019m fond of it and find it not only allows me to type faster\u00a0but more accurately as well, especially when compared to the old school Pro and Air typeface.\nAfter spending about 20 minutes typing on the Pro\u2019s new keyboard, including while writing up this hands-on, I started to notice that the keys actually feel slightly more responsive than the ones present in the Pro\u2019s smaller, 12-inch brother. I\u2019m not sure why exactly, but they do. The standard function keys present in older versions of Apple\u2019s laptops but absent from the new Touch Bar wielding devices, also makes a return in this lower-end iteration.\nHere\u2019s where things get worthwhile, though; apart from an obvious subtle aesthetic shift to a flat, no longer slopped body, the new MacBook Pro\u2019s absolutely massive trackpad is a welcome change.\nMulti-Touch gestures are easier to input thanks to the trackPad\u2019s 46 percent larger size. I\u2019ve always found Apple\u2019s trackpads to be the differentiating factor in the laptop market. Despite how much I like Microsoft\u2019s Surface Book and to a lesser extent, the Surface, neither device\u2019s trackpad feels as fluid as Apple\u2019s technology, especially when the new Pro is taken into consideration.\nI\u2019m less fond of the shift towards Force Touch and away from a physical click, but similar to the 12-inch MacBook, I\u2019ll likely get used to it. It\u2019s also worth noting that the virtual Force Touch \u201cclick\u201d in the Pro actually feels more satisfying than the tech did with the 12-inch MacBook.\nUnder the hood\nApple has made some lofty claims about the 13-inch Pro regarding its hardware prowess, stating that its Core i7 Skylake architecture and integrated Intel Iris Graphics 540 card are significantly more powerful than the tech featured in its predecessor. Some expected more of a technical leap with Apple\u2019s new Pros that included Intel\u2019s new Kaby Lake architecture as well as an independent graphics card on the lower-end version, especially considering their hefty price tag, but unfortunately that is not the case.\nAll in, Apple claims that the new 13-inch MacBook is 80 percent faster than the previous generation of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. While this is likely true, I haven\u2019t had enough time to push the computer yet. On paper, however, the new Pro is certainly impressive, with the laptop sporting\u00a08GB of RAM, Intel Core i5 processor and a 256GB SSD drive.\nWhere things start to get murky is when the laptops Thunderbolt 3 (which are just USB-C ports) are taken into consideration. Yes, USB-C makes life difficult right now, but there is no doubt that it is the future of connectivity. Would it have been great if Apple included USB-C and standard USB-A ports in the Pro? Definitely, but that also would result in the laptop being slightly thicker.\nLike it or not the #donglelife is here to stay, at least in this awkward transition period between port technology.\nThe 13-inch Pro features two USB-C ports that can be used for charging, instead of the four featured in its 13-inch and 15-inch with Touch Bar compatriots. While I\u2019ve defended the decision to opt for USB-C in these new laptops, what\u2019s impossible to argue is how easy it would have been for Apple to include a free adapter that allows older USB-A to be plugged into the laptop. Apple definitely heard the vocal complaints from 12-inch MacBook owners but opted not to listen when it comes to this refresh.\nHigh price tag\nThe 13-inch Pro\u2019s price tag is unfortunately astronomical, especially in Canada, coming in at $1,899 to the shock of many of us living north of the border.\nThe price is difficult to navigate, especially when the laptop, despite a minor aesthetic face lift and a collection of new features, may not be enough of an upgrade for those\u00a0who recently purchased a MacBook Pro or Air.\nIf you have an aging MacBook Pro Air, one from 2012 or even as far back as 2011, this could be the device for you, especially if you scoffed at Apple\u2019s more expensive Touch Bar equipped versions of the new Mac.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2016-10-28T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

All rights reserved. Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our\nJan. 14, 2017, 4:49 AM\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak working in their garage.\nApple Inc.\nIt has been 10 years since the iPhone was launched, 40 years since Apple was officially incorporated, and 41 years since the founding of the company itself.\nNeedless to say, the company has changed dramatically since 1977, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak moved out of the Jobs' family garage to the company's first official corporate address, 20863 Stevens Creek Blvd., (Building 3, Suite C) in Cupertino, California.\nThe pair had begun shipping their first computer, a naked circuit board called Apple I. It had neither a keyboard nor a screen, and functioned more as part of a kit that computer hobbyists could build on, if they knew what they were doing.\nMost people don't know that Apple still owns its first official office.\nTwo early Apple employees, Bob Martinengo and Mark Johnson, spoke to Business Insider about what it was like working with the two Steves back in the days when nobody knew what Apple was. They passed on to us this collection of images from Apple's early days. We've combined it with some other early Apple images from Business Insider's archives. A handful of Steve Jobs' old business cards went up for auction in 2015, and we've got images of those too. Finally, Apple employee No.8, Chris Espinosa, recently tweeted some imagery from his archive.\nScroll down to look at the origins of the most important tech company on the planet.\u2193\u2193\u2193\n1/\nIt's 1973 - three years before he created Apple - and an 18-year-old Steve Jobs needs a job. He had just dropped out of Reed College. This old job application shows that Jobs doesn't have a car, needs a ride, and doesn't have a phone. But he does list \"computer\" and \"calculator\" as skills, and \"electronics tech or design engineer\" as interests.\nRR Auction/Getty\n2/\nEarly Apple images are relatively rare. In the 1970s people did not use cameras on a daily basis. These images are remarkable because they show life at Apple before everyone realized the company was going to change the world. For them, it was just a paycheck.\nThis image shows Chrisann Brennan, Mark Johnson, and\u00a0Robert Martinengo standing in front of what appears to be a pile of boxes containing the Apple II.\nRobert Martinengo\n\"It was obviously a heck of a lot of fun,\" Martinengo says. (He now works at AMAC Accessibility, a company that makes products and services for disabled students.)\nBrennan, 22 at the time, had become Jobs' girlfriend in high school when she was 17, a relationship he later trashed when she became pregnant. Jobs disavowed the child, Lisa, despite naming the Apple Lisa machine (in development in 1978) after her. Jobs only admitted Lisa was his daughter when she reached her teens.\n3/\nThis 1978 image shows more of the Apple II team, including Steve Jobs.\nFrom left to right: Elmer Baum, Mike Markkula, Gary Martin, Andre Sousan, Steve Jobs, Sue Cabannis, Mike Scott, and Don Breuner. Standing in the rear is Mark Johnson.\nMark Johnson\nJohnson, like Martinengo, was employed to assemble the Apple II. \"This photo (above) was taken on a Friday,\" Johnson says. \"We were waiting for UPS to pick up the 57 Apple II computers that were completed. The reason the photo was taken was because that was the first time that we tested, assembled and shipped 57 units in one work week. A big accomplishment back then for the team.\"\nNote that in this photo, Jobs appears to be arguing with Mike Scott, the first president of the company, who had been brought in to keep a leash on Jobs. This was a typical event, Johnson says.\nElmer Baum was an engineer. \"He was a senior, responsible person they brought,\" Johnson says. \"He worked in production and engineering. He was a little bit grumpy, 'you kids get off my lawn!' kind of guy.\" Baum's nephew, Jesse Berger, tells us, \"He had a wonderful sense of humor, especially about himself, and was amused to find himself working with all these computer whizzes \u2026 After having been a pioneer in early wireless communications, working on classified programs during and after WWII, he was tickled to be working again on cutting-edge endeavors.\"\n4/\nHere's an early set of Apple company files.\nDigibarn\nThis image comes from the collection held by Digibarn .\n5/\nMike Markulla was the venture capitalist who provided Apple's first proper funding and installed real management. He used to drive a Corvette Stingray. (Johnson, who was a teenager at the time, said he did get a ride in it once.)\nMarkulla invested the first $250,000 of venture capital money into Apple.\n6/\nHere's another shot of the crew on the Apple II team, with the product in the background on a set of racks.\nLeft to right: Elmer Baum, Mark Johnson, Don Breuner, and Daniel Kottke.\nMark Johnson\nKottke, another hardware technician, has since become something of an archivist of early Apple memorabilia .\n7/\nConditions in the office were primitive.\n8/\nThis floor plan (below) of the Stevens Creek office, drawn by Johnson, shows just how small the company was at the time.\nMark Johnson\nIt was \"a rather small office space,\" Johnson says. \"This one office included the lobby and office space without a dividing wall. When you turn to the right, you enter the manufacturing area. Incidentally, Apple occupied the adjacent office space to the right of suite C. A smaller office space where Bill Fernandez designed circuit board layouts.\"\n9/\nIn the Stevens Creek office, Jobs and Wozniak worked right next to each other. That would change when Apple \u2014 now with about 30 employees \u2014 moved to its second, slightly larger office on Bandley Drive, also in Cupertino. There, Jobs and Woz sat as far apart as possible.\nRobert Martinengo\n\"In the short time I was there it went from a goofy startup to a full-blown production line,\" Johnson says.

{"title": "Backdoor In WhatsApp End-To-End Encryption Discovered, But It Can Be Fixed [Updated] | Redmond Pie", "content": "Backdoor In WhatsApp End-To-End Encryption Discovered, But It Can Be Fixed [Updated]\nBy Oliver Haslam | January 14th, 2017\nFans of privacy and online security will be dismayed to learn that WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned instant messaging service which claimed to offer end-to-end encryption for all users, may not actually be as secure as we were led to believe.\nThe revelation comes following a report that the encryption used by the service suffers from a fatal flaw which could, possibly deliberately, allow Facebook to see messages sent by users, perhaps opening the company up to requests from the government. End-to-end encryption would normally mean that only the sender and the receiver of the message would have access to the encryption keys required to decode the message, meaning the service owner itself would have no access.\nAccording to\u00a0Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley however, a flaw in the Signal\u00a0protocol created by Open Whisper Systems means that WhatsApp has the ability to force the change of a key when offline. New messages would then be sent as normal with the user having no idea that the key had changed.\nThe recipient is not made aware of this change in encryption, while the sender is only notified if they have opted-in to encryption warnings in settings, and only after the messages have been re-sent. This re-encryption and rebroadcasting effectively allows WhatsApp to intercept and read users\u2019 messages.\nInterestingly, the Signal app does not suffer from the same problem, which obviously leaves WhatsApp and Facebook open to the question of why it is in evidence here.\n[In Signal], if a recipient changes the security key while offline, for instance, a sent message will fail to be delivered and the sender will be notified of the change in security keys without automatically resending the message.\nBoelter reportedly told Facebook about the issue back in April, only to be told that the app was exhibiting expected behavior. That alone is troublesome, and Facebook is now being coy about the whole situation. As things stand right now though, if security of your messages is paramount we can only suggest using the Signal app rather than WhatsApp \u2013 at least until things are cleared up.\nUpdate x1: Facebook has now responded to the issue, offering a \u201csolution\u201d in the form of Show Security Notifications feature could be turned on in the app to notify whenever a security code is\u00a0changed:\nOver one billion people use WhatsApp today because it is simple, fast, reliable and secure. At WhatsApp, we\u2019ve always believed that people\u2019s conversations should be secure and private. Last year, we gave all our users a better level of security by making every message, photo, video, file and call end-to-end encrypted by default.\nIn WhatsApp\u2019s implementation of the Signal protocol, we have a \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d setting (option under Settings > Account > Security) that notifies you when a contact\u2019s security code has changed. We know the most common reasons this happens are because someone has switched phones or reinstalled WhatsApp. This is because in many parts of the world, people frequently change devices and Sim cards. In these situations, we want to make sure people\u2019s messages are delivered, not lost in transit.\nUpdate x2: WhatsApp has released a statement of its own as well:\nThe Guardian posted a story this morning claiming that an intentional design decision in WhatsApp that prevents people from losing millions of messages is a \u201cbackdoor\u201d allowing governments to force WhatsApp to decrypt message streams.This claim is false.\nWhatsApp does not give governments a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor. The design decision referenced in the Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks. WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design, and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-14T04:00:16Z", "images": []}

According to the FTC's lawsuits, Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain baseband processors to impose \"onerous and anticompetitive supply and licensing terms\" on cell phone manufacturers to help weaken competitors. The report specifically notes that Qualcomm forced Apple to use its chips exclusively in exchange for reduced licensing fees, hamstringing competitors and harming overall competition.\nQualcomm holds numerous patents on the common protocols and technologies used for networking in many devices, and the FTC says Qualcomm abused that power to harm the overall market.\n\"According to the complaint, by threatening to disrupt cell phone manufacturers\u2019 supply of baseband processors, Qualcomm obtains elevated royalties and other license terms for its standard-essential patents that manufacturers would otherwise reject,\" notes the FTC.\n\"These royalties amount to a tax on the manufacturers\u2019 use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm\u2019s competitors, a tax that excludes these competitors and harms competition. Increased costs imposed by this tax are passed on to consumers, the complaint alleges.\"\nIn other words, phone makers were offered a discount if they just used Qualcomm's modems, effectively forcing them to pay extra if they want to use a rival's chipset.\n\"By excluding competitors, Qualcomm impedes innovation that would offer significant consumer benefits, including those that foster the increased interconnectivity of consumer products, vehicles, buildings, and other items commonly referred to as the Internet of Things,\" the agency states.\nInterested readers can find the full complaint here (pdf), and the FTC's announcement of the Qualcomm suit here .

Speaking at a UBS Tech Conference in November as a member of a panel of Apple experts, Dediu said:\n\"Content is a huge problem to attack on a global scale. Take Netflix for example, what would they do in China? ... Each region has a certain taste. A lot of things in content are local ... Content is culture. Apple wants to create its own culture. The Apple brand is universal by their definition of it. When you're dealing with content, it gets messy.\"\nDediu isn't the only one to respond negatively to the report. Andreessen Horowitz partner Benedict Evans said in his newsletter that Apple's exploration into making original TV content \"feels like a lack of self-confidence in the core product, if true.\"\nHere's Dediu's full comment to Business Insider:\n\"Content is neither an attractive business nor one which is compatible with Apple's business model or culture. The reasons for becoming a producer may have more to do with an impatience with existing sources of content to license on acceptable terms and with the rise of proprietary content from alternative distributors (Amazon, Netflix). I would therefore read this as reactive move rather than something Apple would do voluntarily. It's table stakes for being in the game, unfortunately.\nFurthermore, there is a glut of new programming and talent and resources for production are fully allocated so their entry will be doubly difficult. They're having to buy in at a high price.\nHaving said that, we know that they've been testing the waters and making some bids for content. I would guess this has been a contingency plan for some time.\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-16T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "FTC sues Qualcomm over chip licensing strategy, alleges antitrust abuses", "content": "ExtremeTech\nFTC sues Qualcomm over chip licensing strategy, alleges antitrust abuses\nFTC sues Qualcomm over chip licensing strategy, alleges antitrust abuses\nBy Joel Hruska on January 18, 2017 at 9:15 am\nComment\nThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page. Terms of use .\nThe Federal Trade Commission has filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging that the company exploited its position as the dominant provider of baseband radios for LTE devices. In its brief, the FTC argues that Qualcomm used its position to extort higher royalties from smartphone manufacturers. The FTC asserts that Qualcomm enforces a \u201cNo license, no chips,\u201d policy in which it will not sell parts to a cell phone manufacturer unless the manufacturer agrees to its patent and licensing terms. The terms of these licenses apparently include substantially elevated license rates on chips manufactured by Qualcomm competitors, which amounts to an unfair tax to any company that wants to build a smartphone with a non-Qualcomm processor.\nQualcomm is also under investigation for refusing to license standards-essential patents to its competitors. It has long been recognized in patent law that organizations can benefit from creating a standard implementation for a technology or capability that everyone can take advantage of. 2G, 3G, HSDPA+, 4G, LTE \u2014 all of these technologies are implemented according to specific standards. When companies contribute IP to the formation of a standard, they are typically required to obey what are known as Fair, Reasonable, and Nondiscriminatory rules (FRAND):\nFair \u2013 terms are not anticompetitive and would not be considered unlawful if imposed by a dominant firm in its relative market.\nReasonable \u2013 the licensing rate for the patents themselves will not result in dramatic cost increases or make the industry uncompetitive. The licensing rate would not be unreasonable if all firms were charged the same rate.\nNondiscriminatory: Licensees are treated equally. Rates are allowed to vary based on external factors like order volume, length of contract, or the creditworthiness of the licensee. Whatever the variations are, however, all licensees must be treated equally.\nFRAND agreements are typically voluntary between the standards body and the patent holder, but the contracts are legally binding. If Qualcomm is indeed refusing to license standards-essential patents to competing baseband suppliers, it would explain both why the company shot to a near-complete lock on the LTE market following that technology\u2019s introduction, as well as shedding some light on why nearly all of the other LTE providers gave up and went home. As of mid-2016, reports suggested Qualcomm had a 50% market share (that\u2019s actually down significantly from where it used to be), with the remaining market divided between Samsung, Intel, MediaTek, and Spreadtrum. Samsung and MediaTek were 37% of the remaining 50% in the first half of 2016, but that may have begun to change since some percentage of iPhones also rely on an Intel broadband chip. Note that this data is worldwide, not US-specific.\nImage by StrategyAnalytics\nThe FTC also alleges that Qualcomm signed an exclusivity deal with Apple from 2011 \u2013 2016 in which Apple agreed to only use Qualcomm baseband chips and Qualcomm gave the company a lower licensing rate as a result. This complaint against the company is just the latest in a string of similar findings. South Korea fined Qualcomm $854 million for its licensing practices, while China fined it $954 million after its own antitrust probe. The EU investigation is ongoing \u00a0as well.\nObviously our ability to evaluate this complaint is limited, since there are sections redacted and we haven\u2019t seen any of the evidence on which the complaint is based. We cannot, for example, draw any conclusions on Qualcomm\u2019s licensing rates or its offers of exclusivity, and since we\u2019re talking about patent standards, those terms matter. One puzzling aspect to the FTC\u2019s filing is that it seeks to draw differentiation between the high-end LTE market in the United States and the general market for LTE in lower-end smartphones. The complaint specifically alleges that Qualcomm faces limited competition for premium LTE processors (definitely true, as evidenced by the overwhelming number of smartphones that use Qualcomm radios). It does not make a general complaint about the rest of the LTE market, though it does state that Qualcomm\u2019s royalty rates and non-FRAND licensing terms apply to the general market for baseband, rather than the premium LTE space.\nQualcomm has issued its own dissenting statement, arguing that the FTC\u2019s case is significantly flawed. \u201cThis is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of Chairwoman Ramirez\u2019s departure and the transition to a new Administration, which reflects a sharp break from FTC practice,\u201d said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel.\nThe timing of this announcement is interesting, said Anshel Sag, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, as it comes within the\u00a0last week of the current administration as their FTC appointees prepare to step down. \u201cIt will be very interesting to see how the Trump administration and their appointees handle this bombshell of a complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that the Trump administration may end up being much less heavy-handed with how they approach this complaint than the Obama administration would have been.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-18T14:15:52Z", "images": []}

Twitter just released its first diversity report since hiring Jeffrey Siminoff , the former director of worldwide inclusion and diversity at Apple, in December 2015.\u00a0Overall, Twitter is 57% white, 32% Asian, 3% black, 4% Hispanic/Latinx, 3% multi-racial, less than one percent American Indian and Native Hawaiian in the U.S. and 37% female worldwide, up from 34% in 2015, according to the 2016 diversity report the company released today.\nThat means Twitter employs slightly fewer white people than it did last year, and the year before that. In 2015, Twitter\u2019s overall employee population was 59% white, 4% Hispanic/Latinx, 31% Asian and 2% black. So, Twitter has increased the number of black people it employs, but has failed to increase the representation of Hispanic/Latinx people at the company. All of this data is reflective of the team as it was on December 19, 2016.\nTwitter\u2019s high-profile appointment of Debra L. Lee, chairman and CEO of BET Networks , as well as the hiring of Jayanta Jenkins, the company\u2019s new global group creative director, helped the company reach its goal of having six percent or more underrepresented minorities in leadership roles, which includes people at the director level and above. In 2015, Twitter didn\u2019t have a single person of color in a leadership role.\nSomething new in the report is the representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer employees. Last year, Twitter gave new hires in the U.S. the option to self-identify as LGBTQ. Of the employees who answered, 10% identified as LGBTQ.\n\u201cWhile this data collection is new and therefore limited, we wanted those who chose to identify to be counted,\u201d Siminoff wrote. He went on to say that \u201cas more employees respond in 2017, we expect to have a more complete picture.\u201d\nFor 2017,\u00a0Twitter has set additional goals for overall female and underrepresented minority representation,\u00a0as well as female and underrepresented minority representation in technical and leadership roles. Twitter also aims to bump up the percentage of underrepresented minorities in leadership roles to eight percent.\n\u201cWhatever the goal area, we will continue to be broadly focused on inclusion, prioritizing intersectionality and specific underrepresented groups, and acting on different opportunities for our different business functions,\u201d Siminoff wrote on the company blog.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, unlike Facebook and Apple , Twitter decided not to report its hiring numbers.\u00a0All Twitter had to say about that was, \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to focus on representation overall, rather than just hiring.\u201d\nWhen I\u00a0prodded a bit more, the Twitter spokesperson directed me to something from its 2015 report.\n\u201cWe considered simply setting company-wide hiring goals, but we don\u2019t want to stop at that,\u201d Twitter\u2019s former VP of diversity and inclusion wrote in August 2015. \u201cIf our aim is to build a company we can really be proud of \u2014 one that\u2019s more inclusive and diverse \u2014 we need to make sure it\u2019s a great place for both new\u00a0and current\u00a0employees to work and to grow.

Until recently, and even now to some extent, it has been sorely lacking in apps. The mobile game situation was even worse. And just when you thought the worst was over, some bad news is hitting Windows 10 Mobile users. Still unofficially confirmed, Microsoft-owned Mojang might stop updating Minecraft\nPocket Edition for the smartphone platform, leaving the open world voxel game to stagnate and, eventually, die there.\nTruth be told, the population of Windows 10 Mobile users might be so small that it might not justify spending developer time and resources to maintain. It will still majorly irk some faithful Windows 10 Mobile users, especially those still hoping for a renaissance of the platform, especially considering how popular Minecraft is among the gaming and modding community.\nMore than anything, this development reflects Microsoft\u2019s commitment to its mobile platform, or, rather, the lack of it. Microsoft officially says it still is interested in that market, but not exactly in the same way as Google or Apple are. Its vision might be more focused on almost literally bringing its Windows 10 PC experience to phones, or at least parts of them.\nThat has Windows Central, who broke the news, speculating on the Windows 10 version of Minecraft eventually replacing this mobile variant.

Touch Bar notebook gave battery times between 8 and 18 hours.\nAt the time, Consumer Reports said that if Apple updated its software with changes to battery performance, the publication would retest the computers.\nBoth Apple and Apple stalwarts disputed the initial results.\nIn statements made to several outlets, including the Apple-centric blog, The Loop , the company said Consumer Reports' tests had relied on a developer-only setting in the Safari browser. \"This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,\" Apple said. The firm then blamed a bug triggered by that setting for the inconsistent battery results.\nSome users, including Consumer Reports readers, seemed to confirm the magazine's findings when they related short battery lifespans on their just-purchased MacBook Pros. Widespread user reports earlier in December, for instance, cited rapid depletion of their notebooks' power and incorrect readings of the on-screen battery-time-left indicator. Apple responded to the complaints by dropping the time-remaining estimate . Instead, users were given only the option to display the remaining charge estimate as a percentage.\nBut others, including some influential Apple bloggers, took Consumer Reports to task.\n\"It's clear now that [the Safari bug] didn't justify the initial sensational ... report,\" wrote John Gruber of Daring Fireball . \"There's no way they would've published that rushed initial report for a laptop from any brand other than Apple. Clickbait, pure and simple.\"\nJim Dalrymple of The Loop also weighed in, calling Consumer Reports \"irresponsible\" and concluding, \"I don't trust a word these people say about anything.\"\nConsumer Reports has drawn the ire of Apple before. In 2010, the publication refused to recommend the then-new iPhone 4 because of reception issues when users touched the external antenna. Four days later, CEO Steve Jobs held a hurriedly-called press conference to defend the smartphone, and took shots at media reports that had called out the iPhone 4's issues. \"This has been so blown out of proportion that it's incredible,\" Jobs said.\nAfter battery tests were rerun, Consumer Reports scored the new Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro notebooks at 75 (13-in.) and 74 (15-in.), comfortably in the Recommended range but lower than top-ranked rivals. In the 12-in. to 13-in. size category, for instance, the magazine gave 81 to the VAIO Z and 80 to an Acer Aspire; both were powered by Windows 10.\nThe fix for the Safari bug will be included in a future update for macOS Sierra, Apple has said.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-19T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

But whoever designed it relied on \u201cancient\u201d coding functions, dating back before the Mac OS X operating system launch in 2001, said Malwarebytes researcher Thomas Reed in the blog post.\nSurprisingly, Fruitfly is also built with Linux shell commands. Reed said he tried running the malware on a Linux machine and found that everything \u201cran just fine\u201d except for Mac-specific code.\nThe old coding, along with the Linux commands, suggest that the malware\u2019s makers maybe didn\u2019t \u201cknow the Mac very well and were relying on old documentation\u201d to develop it, Reed wrote.\u00a0\nSecurity researchers have said Mac malware is pretty rare. That\u2019s because hackers generally focus on attacking Windows-based devices, which there are far more of.\u00a0\nThis particular Mac malware is easy to spot, according to Reed. It comes in two files, one of which acts as a launch agent. \u00a0\nNevertheless, Malwarebytes found evidence suggesting that Fruitfly has been infecting Macs undetected for at least few years. For instance, a change made to the malicious coding was done to address OS X Yosemite, which was launched in Oct. 2014. \u00a0\nReed said this malware has remained undetected probably because it\u2019s been used \u201cin very tightly targeted attacks, limiting its exposure.\u201d\nHe speculates the malware was designed for espionage, given that it was found targeting biomedical research institutions. Once the malware infects a Mac, it will also attempt to retrieve information on local network and other devices connected to it.\nFortunately, Apple has already released an update that protects Macs from Fruitfly infections. \u00a0\nTo comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-19T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Of those who bought a new iPhone in the fourth quarter, 32% selected the iPhone 7 Plus, one of two models introduced in September. Another 40% chose the smaller, less expensive iPhone 7.\nThe iPhone 7 Plus share of the total approached double that of the then-new iPhone 6S Plus the year before: Just 19% of all fourth-quarter iPhones in 2015 were the bigger-screen model.\nApple introduced its first 5.5-in. smartphone in 2014 when it unveiled the iPhone 6 Plus. Together with the 4.7-in. iPhone 6, the pair sparked record sales of 75 million in the December quarter.\nAlthough CIRP did not publish total, or even U.S.-only, estimates for 2016's fourth quarter, the poll results signaled a likely increase in the iPhone's ASP, or average selling price, Leven said, because of the larger percentage of the pricier 7 Plus. In both 2014 and 2015, the December quarter's ASP was approximately $690, the highest each year.\n\"First, there are a lot of people coming from smaller phones, and they're seeing all their friends with larger phones,\" said Levin when asked to speculate on why the iPhone 7 Plus share jumped. The increasing prevalence of bigger smartphones, including a large number of Android-powered devices, has put them into proximity of more consumers, he argued. That led to more Apple loyalists -- by far the biggest group of iPhone buyers -- hearing about the advantages of expanded screens, and in turn choosing that for themselves.\n\"Second, as the carriers have restructured [rates and subsidies], it's made the larger phones seem a lot more affordable,\" Levin continued. While the $100 price difference between iPhones under the subsidized model may have scared off consumers, when the phones are paid for monthly, as is typical now, the gap is perceived as negligible. At Verizon, for example, a new 32GB iPhone 7 runs $27 monthly, an iPhone 7 Plus $32.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-20T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Flashy enterprises such as the BRAIN Initiative, announced by Barack Obama in 2013, or the Human Brain Project, approved by the European Union in the same year, aim to analyse the way that thousands or even millions of nerve cells interact in a real brain. The hope is that the torrents of data these schemes generate will contain some crucial nuggets that let neuroscientists get closer to understanding how exactly the brain does what it does.\nBut a paper just published in PLOS Computational Biology questions whether more information is the same thing as more understanding. It does so by way of neuroscience\u2019s favourite analogy: comparing the brain to a computer. Like brains, computers process information by shuffling electricity around complicated circuits. Unlike the workings of brains, though, those of computers are understood on every level.\u00a0\nGet our daily newsletter\nSee more\nEric Jonas of the University of California, Berkeley, and Konrad Kording of Northwestern University, in Chicago, who both have backgrounds in neuroscience and electronic engineering, reasoned that a computer was therefore a good way to test the analytical toolkit used by modern neuroscience. Their idea was to see whether applying those techniques to a microprocessor produced information that matched what they already knew to be true about how the chip works.\nTheir test subject was the MOS Technology 6502, first produced in 1975 and famous for powering, among other things, early Atari, Apple and Commodore computers. With just 3,510 transistors, the 6502 is simple enough for enthusiasts to have created a simulation that can model the electrical state of every transistor, and the voltage on every one of the thousands of wires connecting those transistors to each other, as the virtual chip runs a particular program. That simulation produces about 1.5 gigabytes of data a second\u2014a large amount, but well within the capabilities of the algorithms currently employed to probe the mysteries of biological brains.\nThe chips are down\nOne common tactic in brain science is to compare damaged brains with healthy ones. If damage to part of the brain causes predictable changes in behaviour, then researchers can infer what that part of the brain does. In rats, for instance, damaging the hippocampuses\u2014two small, banana-shaped structures buried towards the bottom of the brain\u2014reliably interferes with the creatures\u2019 ability to recognise objects.\nWhen applied to the chip, though, that method turned up some interesting false positives. The researchers found, for instance, that disabling one particular group of transistors prevented the chip from running the boot-up sequence of \u201cDonkey Kong\u201d\u2014the Nintendo game that introduced Mario the plumber to the world\u2014while preserving its ability to run other games. But it would be a mistake, Dr Jonas points out, to conclude that those transistors were thus uniquely responsible for \u201cDonkey Kong\u201d. The truth is more subtle. They are instead part of a circuit which implements a much more basic computing function that is crucial for loading one piece of software, but not some others.\nAnother neuroscientific approach is to look for correlations between the activity of groups of nerve cells and a particular behaviour. Applied to the chip, the researchers\u2019 algorithms found five transistors whose activity was strongly correlated with the brightness of the most recently displayed pixel on the screen. Again, though, that seemingly significant finding was mostly an illusion. Drs Jonas and Kording know that these transistors are not directly involved in drawing pictures on the screen. (In the Atari, that was the job of an entirely different chip, the Television Interface Adaptor.) They are only involved in the trivial sense that they are used by some part of the program which is ultimately deciding what goes on the screen.\nThe researchers also analysed the chip\u2019s wiring diagram, something biologists would call its connectome. Feeding this into analytical algorithms yielded lots of superficially impressive data that hinted at the presence of some of the structures which the researchers knew were present within the chip. On closer inspection, though, little of it turned out to be useful. The patterns were a mishmash of unrelated structures that were as misleading as they were illuminating. This fits with the frustrating experience of real neuroscience. Researchers have had a complete connectome of a tiny worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, which has just 302 nerve cells, since 1986. Yet they understand much less about how the creature\u2019s \u201cbrain\u201d works than they do about computer chips with millions of times as many components.\nThe essential problem, says Dr Jonas, is that the neuroscience techniques failed to find many chip structures that the researchers knew were there, and which are vital for comprehending what is actually going on in it. Chips are made from transistors, which are tiny electronic switches. These are organised into logic gates, which implement simple logical operations. Those gates, in turn, are organised into structures such as adders (which do exactly what their name suggests). An arithmetic logic unit might contain several adders. And so on.\nBut inferring the existence of such high-level structures\u2014working out exactly how the mess of electrical currents within the chip gives rise to a cartoon ape throwing barrels at a plumber\u2014is difficult. That is not a problem unique to neuroscience. Dr Jonas draws a comparison with the Human Genome Project, the heroic effort to sequence a complete human genome that finished in 2003. The hope was that this would provide insights into everything from cancer to ageing. But it has proved much more difficult than expected to extract those sorts of revelations from what is, ultimately, just a long string of text written in the four letters of the genetic code.\nThings were not entirely hopeless. The researchers\u2019 algorithms did, for instance, detect the master clock signal, which co-ordinates the operations of different parts of the chip. And some neuroscientists have criticised the paper, arguing that the analogy between chips and brains is not so close that techniques for analysing one should automatically work on the other.\nGa\u00ebl Varoquaux, a machine-learning specialist at the Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, in France, says that the 6502 in particular is about as different from a brain as it could be. Such primitive chips process information sequentially. Brains (and modern microprocessors) juggle many computations at once. And he points out that, for all its limitations, neuroscience has made real progress. The ins-and-outs of parts of the visual system, for instance, such as how it categorises features like lines and shapes, are reasonably well understood.\nDr Jonas acknowledges both points. \u201cI don\u2019t want to claim that neuroscience has accomplished nothing!\u201d he says. Instead, he goes back to the analogy with the Human Genome Project. The data it generated, and the reams of extra information churned out by modern, far more capable gene-sequencers, have certainly been useful. But hype-fuelled hopes of an immediate leap in understanding were dashed. Obtaining data is one thing. Working out what they are saying is another.\nThis article appeared in the Science and technology section of the print edition under the headline \"Does not compute\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-21T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Qualcomm fires back against Apple over lawsuit and FTC action", "content": "Brian Heater @bheater / 2 years\nNever a dull moment in the smartphone wars. This week, Qualcomm started getting serious regulatory heat when the Federal Trade Commission filed charges against the chipmaker , accusing it of anticompetitive tactics designed to shut competitors out from supplying components to handset companies.\nApple was one of the few manufacturers mentioned by name in the complaint, and accordingly, the company filed its own suit \u00a0announced towards end of day yesterday, stating that, \u201cQualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined,\u201d in a statement provided to TechCrunch.\nQualcomm has since provided us with a response, and it\u2019s a dozy, so let\u2019s\u00a0just go ahead and paste the whole thing in here. This one comes from the company\u2019s EVP and General Counsel, Don Rosenberg,\nWhile we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple\u2019s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm\u2019s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple\u2019s practices and a robust examination of the merits.\nAs you can see, the company plainly suggests that Apple\u2019s \u2018baseless\u2019 attacks were behind the FTC\u2019s charges, something the company accuses it of spurring on \u201cby misrepresenting facts and withholding information.\u201d\nThe statement also suggests that Apple acted similarly in other parts of the world, and seeming reference to the fact that the\u00a0FTC wasn\u2019t the first to get on Qualcomm for unfair practices in recent years.\nThe San Diego-based chipmaker has also faced similar issues around the world, getting hit with big fines in South Korea ($854 million) and China ($975 million), along with some scrutiny in the European Union.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-21T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Sobrato \u201960, is a longtime member of Santa Clara University\u2019s Board of Trustees and founder of The Sobrato Organization (TSO) of Cupertino, California, one of the largest commercial development firms in Silicon Valley. In 1996, the couple and their three children launched the Sobrato Family Foundation.\nThe Sobratos have been married for 56 years, during which time Mrs. Sobrato has been an active partner supporting the family\u2019s business and philanthropic pursuits. Mrs. Sobrato prioritized raising her three children and giving back to the family\u2019s community through financial resources and personal time commitments. In addition to their three children\u2014John Michael \u201883, Lisa Sobrato Sonsini, and Sheri Sobrato Brisson M.A. \u201894\u2014the pair has five grandsons and two granddaughters.\nThe Sobratos have been prominent philanthropists in Silicon Valley for decades, and particularly generous to SCU. They donated $20 million to build the University\u2019s Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Technology Center, and Orradre Library, completed in 2008. Gifts from the Sobrato family have also supported other major capital projects on campus, including the Sobrato Residential Learning Community, Abby Sobrato Mall, and other campus buildings. Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, capital gifts from the Sobrato family have included $20 million to Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital, $10 million to Bellarmine College Preparatory high school, and $5 million each to Valley Medical Center and National Hispanic University. A $1.25 million gift in 2012 helped build the Cristo Rey San Jose Jesuit High School.\nJohn A. Sobrato is proud to trace his professional success back to his days studying business at Santa Clara University. While a student, Sobrato arranged his class schedule so he could start selling Eichler houses in Palo Alto three days a week. By the age of 22, he founded Midtown Realty and was the youngest member of the Million Dollar Club of the Palo Alto Real Estate Board. In 1972, he sold Midtown Realty to focus exclusively on high-tech commercial properties, and went on to develop the iconic Apple headquarters in Cupertino and campuses for Siebel, Nvidia, Netflix, EMC, VeriSign, and Yahoo! Over the years, TSO developed more than 15 million square feet of office and R&D properties, and currently owns 92 commercial buildings in the Valley totaling nearly 8 million square feet, and 29 apartment communities along the West Coast.\nSobrato serves as board chair of both the family firm and the Sobrato Family Foundation (SFF), whose robust community impact platform focuses on 21st century education and career pathways, provides millions each year in community-mainstay general operating support, and runs three Sobrato Centers for Nonprofits, which provide 333,000 square feet of rent-free office space to 72 organizations and high-quality conference space to all Bay Area nonprofits.

{"title": "How to break free from the Apple ecosystem", "content": "How to break free from the Apple ecosystem\nAntonio Villas-Boas\nShutterstock/Business Insider\nThe iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch make for a great team, as they work with each other to streamline common tasks and make them easier to do.\nHowever, there are several reasons you might want to explore other options, like Android phones and Windows computers.\nWhatever your reason might be, leaving the Apple ecosystem can be a tough thing to do, and you might not find some of the useful features from the Apple ecosystem anywhere else.\nTo make the transition easier, though, here are a few tips to start with:\n1. First, you'll need new, non-Apple devices.\nThe computer.\nYouTube/HP\nIf you use software that isn't your web browser, your best bet is going to be a Windows 10 laptop. There are several Windows 10 laptops out there you might like at different price ranges. Here are five Windows 10 laptops that outprice the new MacBooks Pros, as well as out-speccing them.\nThose laptops I suggest in the link above are pretty powerful, but while they're also pricey, they're still less expensive than the new MacBook Pros. There are a bunch of great Windows 10 laptops in the $700 range that aren't as powerful; those could fit your needs, too.\nIf 99% of the things you do on your Mac are based in a web browser, you could consider Chromebooks . They run Chrome OS, which is essentially the Chrome web browser, and they can cost a lot less than a Windows 10 laptop.\nThe phone.\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nThere are a bunch of great Android phones , but if I had to pick one, it would be Google's own Pixel or Pixel XL .\nIt's the purest expression of what Google thinks a smartphone should be, and you'll get the latest Android and security updates directly from Google as they're released, not several months later like the majority of Android smartphones.\nThe smartwatch.\nAntonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\nIf you have an Apple Watch, the bad news is that it's not compatible with anything else apart from Apple products.\nIf you must have a smartwatch, go for Samsung's Gear S3 Classic or Frontier. They work with most recent Android smartphones , and they're very good as far as smartwatches go. And if you get a Samsung smartphone, you can use Samsung Pay with the Gear S3, too, which works in pretty much any store that has a credit card reader.\nUnfortunately, however, you won't find the useful Auto Unlock feature from the Apple ecosystem, which unlocks your Mac computer when you're wearing your Apple Watch.\n2. Now, you'll need a new account to transfer contacts, photos, videos, and calendars from the iPhone you're trying to escape from.\nTo move away from the Apple ecosystem means you'll need to adopt a new ecosystem: In this case, it's almost certainly going to be Google. Even if you're using a Microsoft device, you'll still probably going to want to use many of Google's useful services on that Microsoft Windows machine.\nIf you don't already have a Google account, get one . It's the best way to transfer your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars, in my opinion.\nDownload Google Drive on your iPhone to sync your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars.\nGoogle/Business Insider\nAll your data in your iPhone can be easily transferred over to a new Android phone. Follow these three simple instructions on how.\nBasically, it's download Google Drive, sign in or sign up, and backup in the app. Then, on your new Android phone, just sign in with your Google account during setup or in Android's settings.\nDon't worry about your photos taking up all the space, Google Photos offers unlimited and free storage for photos taken with cameras using 16 megapixels or less, and videos filmed in 1080p.\nIf your photos and videos exceed those specs, Google Photos will automatically reduce their resolution. Don't worry, they will still look great.\n3. Now, transfer stuff from your Mac to your new computer.\nYou can use a good ol' fashioned hard drive.\nAmazon/Seagate\nJust plug the hard drive in to your old Mac, transfer your files and folders, and unload them into your new machine. This only works for Windows PCs, though; for Chromebook owners, your best bet will be to use Google Drive (more on that in a bit).\nIf you have a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, you get a ton of free OneDrive cloud storage to transfer your files and folders from your Mac to your Windows machine.\nYouTube/Microsoft Store\nYou get a free terabyte (1,000 GB) of storage in Microsoft's OneDrive if you subscribe to Office 365 for things like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. That should be plenty of storage for all your files and folders on your Mac.\nTo transfer everything, go to OneDrive and log in with your Office 365 login details. Then, start clicking and dragging your files and folders into OneDrive on your Mac's web browser.\nIf you're switching to a Chromebook, or you want to move stuff to your new Windows PC without Office 365, use Google Drive, which has 15GB of free storage.\nTech Insider/Flickr/Horia Varlan\nOn your Mac's web browser, go to Google Driv e and sign in with your Google account.\nThen, you can click and drag files and folders from your Mac to Google Drive in your web browser.\nYou can buy more storage if you need more than the free included 15 GB. It's not very expensive at $2 per month for 100 GB.\n4. Switch from Apple's Messages to a universal messaging service, like Google Hangouts.\nAntonio Villas-Boas\nHaving Messages on the Mac to send and receive texts you're also getting on your phone is a pretty tough feature to leave behind if you're ditching the Apple ecosystem, especially since you could get standard SMS messages on your Mac -- not just iMessages between Apple devices -- after OS X Yosemite was released.\nUnfortunately, Windows 10 doesn't have an equivalent native app that will work with Android phones to send and receive text messages. There are some third-party apps, like mySMS, which received decent reviews, but they're not ideal or as good as Messages on Macs.\nTo send quick messages to your contacts from both your computer and your phone, the best solution is to use a messenger app that's cross-platform (available on both computers and phones, just like iMessages) rather than using text messages at all. It helps to use a service where many of your contacts are likely to have accounts, like Facebook or Google.\nGoogle Hangouts is a great messenger app that also has video and voice chat. It's not quite the same thing as getting your actual phone calls on your Mac based on your actual phone number, but it's a pretty good alternative. You can use Hangouts from your Gmail account online, the Android app, or from the Hangouts web app .\nFacebook's Messenger also works across all your devices, and it features video and voice-calling, too.\nAntonio Villas-Boas\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-20T23:00:12Z", "images": []}

Foxconn confirmed the report Monday.\nAn investment by Foxconn, whose main listed unit is\nHon Hai Precision Industry Co. ,\u00a0would mark a victory for Trump, who\u2019s repeatedly blasted China for stealing American jobs and devastating U.S. manufacturing. But Foxconn is one of the single largest private employers in China and the government there has conveyed its\nconcern over the possibility that it will shift investment away from the country.\nChina is pivotal to Foxconn\u2019s massive electronics assembly operation, which cranks out more iPhones and iPads than any other in the world. Foxconn has\nsaid it\u2019s in preliminary discussions to broaden its investment in the U.S., without elaborating. Trump has often articulated his vision of bringing manufacturing jobs back to America from China, which became the world\u2019s factory floor thanks to cheap labor and central policy support. And he\u2019s singled out Apple in the past.\nA potential strategic shift by Foxconn unnerves Chinese authorities because the company employs roughly a million workers across the country. Major factory job cuts have been known to trigger protests in the past, even as maintaining social stability remains among the top priorities of the ruling Communist Party.\nFor now, Foxconn\u2019s prospective U.S. plans remain preliminary. The envisioned facility could cost more than $7 billion and may create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs, according to Gou.\u00a0It would also bring manufacturing closer to the largest market for iPhones and iPads, a potential boon for Apple, which yields about half Hon Hai\u2019s revenue.\u00a0The plant could be a joint investment with Apple, the Nikkei Asian Review\nreported Monday. Apple didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe idea took shape after Gou spoke with Masayoshi Son, chairman of SoftBank Group Corp. and a close business partner. Son, who\u2019s announced his own plan to invest $50 billion in the U.S., asked Gou for his views. A document Son held up for reporters after a December meeting with Trump included the words \u201cFoxconn\u201d and \u201c$7 billion\u201d alongside SoftBank\u2019s numbers.\n\u201cI thought it was a private conversation, but then the next morning it was exposed,\u201d Gou told reporters according to Reuters. \u201cThere is such a plan, but it is not a promise. It is a wish.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Gou also told reporters he sees American protectionism as \u201cinevitable\u201d\u00a0and warned about the subsequent threat to economic development.\n\u2014 With assistance by Edwin Chan, Yuan Gao, and Brendan Coffey\nPublished on\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-22T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Terms of use .\nEver since Samsung recalled, reissued, and double-recalled the Galaxy Note 7, there\u2019s been curiosity and contention over what, exactly, killed the phone. This has ranged from the conspiratorial (Apple is paying the media to manufacture reports of fires) to the prosaic explanation that whatever battery failure killed the first round of Note 7\u2019s either hadn\u2019t been fixed or hadn\u2019t been identified in the second run. Now, Samsung has released its own autopsy on what went wrong with the device \u2014 and how two problems, not just one, combined to kill it.\nAs previously rumored, there was a manufacturing defect in the corner of the batteries. A design flaw made the electrodes prone to bending. This could lead to a separation and short-circuit in the battery itself, and was responsible for some of the fires. This was the problem with the first set of batteries \u2014 the ones that Samsung initially reported it would replace via recall.\nWhen the Galaxy Note 7 launched, Samsung was dual-sourcing its batteries. After it realized that one of its designs had a problem, it started switching production to another battery manufacturer, but in that case, a welding defect could lead to problems with the batteries. Some of these issues were also possibly tied to a lack of insulation tape, which should have shipped standard on the hardware but didn\u2019t. The infographic below explains the difference between the two defects and gives some background information on the two problems.\nThese mistakes in the second battery run doomed the second set of devices to have exactly the same problem as the first. Samsung\u2019s investigation into its product failure was conducted with 700 dedicated staff and the help of three extra laboratories \u2014 UL, Exponent, and TUV Rheinland. The teams tested 200,000 phones and 30,000 batteries to come to its conclusions.\nMore than anything, this illustrates how complex a device smartphones actually are. There was nothing wrong with the Galaxy Note 7\u2019s design, its charging systems, or its battery programming. Instead, the problem came down to a short-circuit flaw and a company that was, perhaps, too ambitious about shoving itself into the marketplace and taking share from its primary competitor, Apple. And it makes sense that the phone wound up with a problem in two batteries.\nWhen Samsung first recalled the Note 7 , one of its battery suppliers had never had a problem. It was only when Samsung tried to ramp up production at the second battery manufacturer that it started running into issues, either because it didn\u2019t precisely duplicate the correct manufacturing process or because the flaw was tiny enough that it only became visible when manufactured at significant scale. \u201cWe believe if not for that manufacturing issue on the ramp [of battery B], the Note 7 would still be on the market,\u201d Samsung Electronics America head Tim Baxter told Recode.\nSamsung will launch the Galaxy S8 in the next few weeks, with the Galaxy Note 8 likely arriving this summer, whether Samsung retains that brand name or not. As bad as blowing the Note 7\u2019s launch and recall was, it was one noted misstep for a company that has produced dozens of high-end devices without any suffering from this kind of problem. So long as customers believe this was a once-off, they\u2019re unlikely to rebel and decamp for other Android device manufacturers.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-23T13:29:39Z", "images": []}

Back in September Apple denied reports that it had interest in potentially acquiring the service, while Samsung, Google, Spotify and others had also reportedly shown interest in making a deal alongside Sprint.\u00a0\nTidal\u2019s differentiator has long been its claimed focus on artist relations, using its CEO Jay Z\u2019s pull in the music industry to get a long list of high-profile artists to both sign-up and offer exclusive content through the service. Its efforts with exclusive content have been called into question , however, as many of the releases later found their way to Apple Music and competing services. Late last year one of its biggest supporters, Kanye West, said competition between Tidal and Apple Music was \u2018hurting the music industry\u2019 \u00a0as rumors of a possible acquisition surfaced.\nQuestions over the service\u2019s growth and subscriber-base also\u00a0 emerged this month as a report from Norwegian newspaper Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv discovered Tidal had inflated its subscriber numbers, putting it at around 850,000 subscribers vs the 3 million it reported back in March of last year.\nSprint CEO Marcelo Claure is joining the TIDAL\u2019s Board of Directors as part of the deal.\u00a0Financial details weren\u2019t disclosed in today\u2019s announcement.\u00a0\u00a0Update:\u00a0Billboard quotes a source that says the deal was worth $200 million.\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-23T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Apple just released the first beta of iOS 10.3 to developers. Among other changes, the beta includes a way to find your lost AirPods in the Find My iPhone app.\nAs you know, Apple\u2019s AirPods only have tiny W1 chips in each earbud. These chips only support Bluetooth \u2014 there\u2019s no Wi-Fi, there\u2019s no GPS and, of course, there\u2019s no cell connection. So what happens exactly if you lose a poor tiny little AirPod?\nThe most likely scenario is that your AirPod is sitting on a table below a stack of magazines and you can\u2019t find it. If it\u2019s in range of your iPhone, you can open the Find My iPhone app and play an alarm sound. While the sound shouldn\u2019t be as loud as your iPhone\u2019s alarm sound, it should be enough to find your AirPod.\nIf you left your AirPods at home, you can see them on a map if they\u2019re within range of an iOS device at home. And if you\u2019re really unlucky and you left your AirPods at a coffee shop, then Find My iPhone will try to show you the last location and time that you had your AirPods on you.\nIt\u2019s not a perfect solution, but it should be good enough if you tend to misplace things in your home.\nIn other news, iOS 10.3 will add cricket scores in Siri for the Indian Premier League, CarPlay refinements and small improvements here and there. My favorite update is a new 3D Touch shortcut on the weather app icon in the corner of the Maps app. You can get hourly forecasts without launching the dedicated Weather app.\niOS 10.3 is going to be in beta for a month or two.

{"title": "Apple will finally let developers respond to App Store reviews", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nApple is finally going to give its developers a way to respond to customer reviews on its App Store and Mac App Store \u2013 a feature that\u2019s long been\u00a0available to Android developers on Google Play, much to the chagrin of the Apple developer community. According to developer documentation for the\u00a0iOS 10.3 beta, when this version of Apple\u2019s mobile operating ships, developers\u00a0will also be able to ask for reviews in new ways, in addition to responding to those posted publicly on the App Store.\nApple\u2019s ratings and reviews system has felt antiquated, and has been a source of frustration for developers and users alike. When a customer\u00a0leaves a negative review, developers couldn\u2019t respond to the criticism \u2013 which is sometimes unwarranted \u2013 in a way that other App Store customers could see. For example, a customer may be misunderstanding a feature, or may have complained about a bug that\u2019s been fixed in a later release.\nBeing able to quickly clarify the situation in a public manner could help to encourage other\u00a0potential customers to give the app a try.\nIn addition, these public comments stand as sort of a record of sorts \u2013 something that\u2019s helpful for customers who want to know if the developer actively supports the application and considers user feedback. This serves as another signal that the app is worth the download or the purchase price, especially in an ecosystem where so many apps had\u00a0been abandoned that Apple had to purge its App Store of outdated applications\u00a0late last year.\nWhile this is one of the most welcome changes that\u2019s shipping in the new release from a developer perspective, it\u2019s not alone.\nRelated to this, Apple says it will also introduce a new way to solicit reviews in iOS 10.3. With the introduction of a new API, developers can ask users to rate or review the app while they\u2019re using it, without being redirected to the App Store. This will go a long way towards\u00a0reducing the nag screens in today\u2019s current crop\u00a0of applications \u2013 some\u00a0of which bug you to rate the app upon nearly every open.\nPositive\u00a0ratings help apps maintain a good rank and encourage downloads, which is why they\u2019re so critical to developers. But for users, having to rate apps has been a poor experience. You\u2019re often interrupted in the middle of trying to use the app, and then asked to exit to the App Store, where you have to sign in to your Apple\u00a0account, rate, then type your review.\nWith the API, developers can now\u00a0determine when they want to prompt users to review their app, and then users can complete this process without as much disruption.\nAccording to a report from Jim Dalrymple of The Loop , developers will be only be able to nag users for reviews three time per year, and once the consumer leaves a review, they can\u2019t be prompted again. Additionally, he says that you\u2019ll be able to switch off notifications for app reviews from the iOS settings.\nBeyond app ratings, another major\u00a0developer-facing feature spotted in the beta is the rollout of the new Apple File System, APFS,\u00a0which first arrived in the Sierra 10.12 beta. Meant to replace HFS+, APFS is optimized for devices with solid state storage, supports 64-bit file IDs, offers strong encryption, is more efficient at managing a hard drive\u2019s free space, improves latency, and more.\u00a0\nWhoa APFS is coming faster than expected. pic.twitter.com/MdaA345VLW\n\u2014 Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) January 24, 2017\nFor consumers, the new iOS includes a number of changes, too, like a \u2018Find my AirPods\u2019 option, \u00a0cricket scores, HomeKit improvements, further Siri integration into apps, and other enhancements.\u00a0\niOS 10.3 will likely be in beta for a month or two, before being released to the public via an over-the-air update.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-24T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Duffy is the co-founder of Wi-Fi camera firm\u00a0Dropcam which was bought by Google in 2014 after being independent for five years.\nDropcam later fell under parent company Alphabet after Google\u2019s major restructuring and was absorbed\u00a0into Nest.\nDuring his tenure at Nest, Duffy is said to have bumped heads with Nest co-founder and ex-iPod chief Tony Fadell. Duffy is said to have told Fadell he was running the company like a\u00a0 \u2018tyrant bureaucrat\u2019 \u00a0before leaving the company he started.\nFadell was replaced as head of Nest \u00a0and left the company\u00a0shortly after widespread stories of poor management surfaced last year.

There's still a great deal that we don't know about the new S8, but as rumors continue to emerge about it, it's becoming easier to piece together information about the device.\nSpeaking with its own 'well placed' sources, The Guardian has published numerous details about the Galaxy S8, many of which support other information that has surfaced in recent weeks.\nThe Galaxy S8 is said to resemble this third-party screen protector | Image: @DforDesign\nLike last year's S7 , the Galaxy S8 is expected to launch in two sizes, both with displays within the range of 5 to 6 inches, codenamed 'Dream' and 'Dream 2'. However, unlike the S7, the new handsets are both said to come with dual-curved displays, dropping the 'flat' screen option that was previously offered.\nThe new screens - referred to as 'infinity displays' - are also said to take up a much larger proportion of the handset, with only a sliver of bodywork visible above and below the main display area, to the point that there may not even be sufficient space to include Samsung's logo on the front of the device.\nThe article also referred to a recent photo of a purported third-party screen protector for the Galaxy S8, saying that the image is accurate in its representation of the handsets' proportions.\nIn line with expectations, the Galaxy S8 is said to come with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 system-on-a-chip; indeed, a recent report suggested that Samsung has bought such great volumes of the 835 that supplies for other manufacturers are now extremely limited . It's not yet known if, like the Galaxy S7, variants of the new handsets will be offered with Samsung's own Exynos chips too.\nDetails regarding storage are a little more hazy. Two sources referred to the Galaxy S8 as coming with 64GB of onboard storage, along with a microSD slot supporting cards up to 256GB. However, it's unclear if Samsung will offer other storage options, or if - like its ill-fated Galaxy Note7 - the Galaxy S8 will only be available with 64GB.\nThe Galaxy S8 will reportedly have the same iris-scanner that debuted on the Note7, allowing users to unlock the device with their eyes, rather than with a password or fingerprint. Microsoft used similar technology on its Lumia Windows 10 Mobile flagships which launched at the end of 2015 , and which are now reaching the end of their retail lives . A fingerprint scanner will still be included, but now positioned on the rear of the handset.\nAlso around the back, the S8 is said to feature a similar 'Dual Pixel' camera to the Galaxy S7, with various improvements as you would expect. Samsung claimed that the S7's camera was able to \"focus as quickly and as accurately as you would with your own eyes.\" That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but the camera on the S7 was extremely good , and it seems reasonable to expect that its successor will be similarly impressive.\nThe S8's rear camera is also believed to include \"built-in object recognition, similar to Google Goggles\". That functionality is likely to be integrated with Samsung's digital assistant, awkwardly named 'Bixby' , for which the company is reportedly partnering with other companies to provide 'data sources', so that it can offer a wide range of functionality to users.\nNotably, several of the article's sources insisted that the Galaxy S8 will have a dedicated 3.5mm headphone jack, rather than following Apple , HTC and others in dropping that port from their newest devices. Along with support for a new Gear VR headset, and an updated version of its Gear 360 camera, the Galaxy S8 is said to feature a USB Type-C port, which is no great surprise.\nImage: All About Windows Phone\nSignificantly, two sources also confirmed details that popped up in a previous report. Earlier this month, a photo surfaced that appeared to show Samsung's plans for a 'Desktop Experience' , which also referred to the 'Next Mobile Workspace'. The image showed a Samsung Android handset connected to an external display with support for multi-tasking, and mouse and keyboard inputs.\nThat information was verified by the two sources, who referred to Samsung's version of the PC-style mode as 'DeX' (desktop extension, or perhaps 'Desktop Experience' as shown on the slide above). Intriguingly, they mentioned not only a desktop dock - just like the Continuum mode in Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile OS - but also a 'service' associated with the experience, as well as other unspecified accessories.\nSamsung has much to prove with the Galaxy S8. The high-profile disaster of the Galaxy Note7 - which was subjected to a full global recall after a series of battery fires - proved to be a costly embarrassment for the Korean tech giant. The company vowed to regain the trust of its customers , and confirmed this week that it will launch a new Galaxy Note8 that will be \"better, safer and very innovative\" .\nLong before the Note8 arrives, though, the Galaxy S8 will offer Samsung the opportunity to put the fiasco of its fiery flagship behind it, and wow the world with its latest and, perhaps, greatest device.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-25T12:40:01Z", "images": []}

The new system\u00a0attempts to strike a balance for customer experience\u00a0and developer incentive, allowing users to leave a rating without leaving the app\u00a0\u2014 but the API enforces that the developer can only\u00a0display the popup three times a year.\nAdoption will not be mandatory with iOS 10.3 but Apple intends to force\u00a0developers to use\u00a0the official API in the future, via Daring Fireball .\nTry Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial\nCurrently,\u00a0apps can\u00a0prompt for reviews and ratings in the App Store however they please.\u00a0This ranges from subtle links in settings pages to full screen modal popups.\u00a0As ratings contribute so heavily to placement in App Store search rankings,\u00a0many apps prompt users\u00a0on a very regular basis \u2014\u00a0often once per app version.\nThe high frequency\u00a0of alerts is\u00a0a pain point for customers who just want to use the\u00a0app and get on with their day.

In addition to the three-per-year limit, once a user leaves a review, the popup will never be shown again.\nWhen Apple finally enforces\u00a0a rule that says developers can only use the first-party API to\u00a0request ratings,\u00a0app makers who are used to prompting for reviews with every new app update are\u00a0are going to have seriously rethink their strategy regarding soliciting\u00a0App Store reviews.\nIt should also cut down on the shady businesses practices many apps employ where they\u00a0try and bias App Store\u00a0ratings upwards by\u00a0only displaying ratings prompts to customers they believe will rate the app highly.\nA date for such\u00a0a policy change was not given which suggests that it is still some ways out and Apple will wait and see community reactions to the iOS 10.3 optional behavior before making it mandatory.\nPart of the reason\u00a0the trend is for apps to ask for reviews so regularly is that the App Store clears out the\u00a0average star rating with every new update.\u00a0This means the review page looks blank and empty\u00a0at the worst times: when developers have just launched a brand new (presumably improved and\u00a0better) version of their applications.\nJohn Gruber at Daring Fireball asked Apple if they intend to change how this works given the three-per-year limit to the\u00a0SKStoreReviewController popup: Apple said they have nothing to formally announce but took the comments onboard and recognize that they are part of the problem.\niOS 10.3 includes\u00a0 several new features for iPhone and iPad users, like Find my AirPods, Siri cricket scores, and more.\u00a0When iOS 10.3 is released\u00a0to the public, Apple will also\u00a0launch the ability for developers to be able to reply to reviews left by App Store customers.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-25T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "How to enable Night Shift for Mac and how it works on macOS 10.12.4 [Video]", "content": "How to enable Night Shift for Mac and how it works on macOS 10.12.4 [Video]\nOne year after introducing\u00a0Night Shift on the iPhone and iPad, Apple is bringing its display color temperature feature to the Mac starting with macOS 10.12.4 . Here\u2019s how to enable Night Shift on your Mac and how it works.\nThis is how Apple describes its Night Shift feature:\nNight Shift adjusts the color of your display after sunset.\u00a0Many studies\u00a0show\u00a0that exposure to bright-blue light in the evening can affect your circadian rhythms and make it harder to fall asleep. After sunset, Night Shift will shift your display colors to the warmer end of the spectrum, making the display easier on your eyes.\u00a0In the morning, your display returns to its regular settings.\nThe feature is very similar to Flux for Mac , although macOS Sierra\u2019s upcoming update makes color temperature shifting a system-level feature. You\u2019ll still get more customization out of Flux like the ability to gradually increase warmth over time, but Night Shift is built-in and very easy to use.\nYour Mac will need macOS 10.12.4 or later to work with Night Shift. macOS 10.12.4 is currently in developer beta and a public beta is likely around the corner; the software update will be available to all users later this year.\nFrom there, you can manually toggle Night Shift on and off from the Today view in Notification Center. In other words, click on the\u00a0\n\u00a0icon in the top right corner of your screen, then click Today at the top of the slide over panel.\nNight Shift\u2019s toggle is a bit hidden here. You have to swipe or scroll down to reveal the button which is right above the Do Not Disturb toggle found above the date.\nIf you want to tweak Night Shift settings, launch\u00a0the System Preferences app and open the Displays section. Night Shift has its own section on macOS 10.12.4 or later.\nNight Shift can be manually enabled or disabled, scheduled based on time of day or sunset/sunrise, and manually adjusted to appear warmer. My preference is to enable Night Shift automatically from sunset to sunrise. You can still manually toggle Night Shift on or off as needed too.\nNight Shift can also be toggled on and off with your voice using Siri. Activate Siri and use a command like \u201cTurn on Night Shift\u201d or \u201cTurn off Night Shift\u201d to enable or disable the feature.\nIf you have Night Shift set to a schedule, manually changing the state will work until the schedule is set to resume. For example, if you enable Night Shift during the day before sunrise and it was already set to turn on at sunset, Night Shift will remain enabled until sunrise and resume its schedule.\nOne place you won\u2019t find a Night Shift toggle yet that you might expect is the Touch Bar on new MacBook Pros. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see this change in future versions of the macOS software as Do Not Disturb is already an option and can similarly be scheduled or toggled.\nSo how does Night Shift look on a Mac? Here\u2019s my MacBook Pro without Night Shift:\nAnd here\u2019s my MacBook Pro with Night Shift:\nHere\u2019s a side-by-side:\nNight Shift isn\u2019t just limited to your Mac\u2019s built-in display. Apple\u2019s color temperature shifting feature also applies to connected external displays as well based on your Mac\u2019s settings.\nOverall, Night Shift for Mac is very similar to the same feature introduced to iPhones and iPads this time last year.

According to a new study from Upwork , tech companies are increasingly looking for developers who know how to develop in Swift.\nUpwork is the biggest freelancer marketplace in the U.S., so the company can identify trends on the freelancer market. The company\u2019s new study finds out the fastest-growing skills in Q4 2016 compared to Q4 2015.\nInterestingly, the first five skills are all tech skills, with natural language processing leading, followed by Swift, Tableau, Amazon Marketplace Web Services to automatically list products on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, and Stripe integrations.\nApple first introduced Swift in June 2014 at its WWDC event. It was introduced as a modern programming language that was supposed to replace Objective-C. But these things tend to take a while, so Apple tried to make the transition as smooth as possible.\nSwift and Objective-C code can live side-by-side in the same application on iOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS. The programming language has evolved quite a lot and was open sourced in December 2015 .\nSince then, Swift has become more mature and versatile. Some developers are even thinking about using Swift for server-side development .\nAnd today\u2019s Upwork study is a tangible sign that companies are switching their main iOS programming language from Objective-C to Swift. Objective-C was first released in the 1980s after all. So maybe it\u2019s time to switch to a newer programming language.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-26T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Qualcomm has spent billions of dollars developing mobile technologies for over three decades, and wants to be fairly compensated for the inventions shared through licensing.\n\"Our preference is to always resolve customer disputes through negotiation instead of litigation. So it is regrettable Apple has chosen to take this path,\" Mollenkopf said.\nThe value of Qualcomm's IP was established long time ago, and the patent portfolio is actually going up in value as the mobile industry moves towards 5G, Mollenkopf said.\n\"Yet, we have never raised our royalty rates,\" Mollenkopf said.\nIn the California lawsuit, Apple is seeking $1 billion in compensation for excessive royalties paid. Apple said in its filing that Qualcomm should charge royalties based on the price of the baseband chip in the mobile device, and not a portfolio of technologies.\nAberle said that was inconceivable, and not in line with how chip technologies have been licensed for decades. Licensing at the component level is inefficient, and a device or modem chip maker would still need to take out licenses for other Qualcomm technologies in smartphones.\nBesides modems, Qualcomm has an huge arsenal of intellectual property that also covers technologies like real-time tracking and mapping, which forms the basis for companies like Uber.\nThe excess royalties in dispute are paid to Qualcomm by contract manufacturers like Foxconn, which assemble the iPad and iPhone, and not directly by Apple.\n\"We hope Apple wouldn't interfere with those contracts,\" Aberle said.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-26T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The latest word, unearthed by Venture Beat , points to a March 29\u00a0launch for the Samsung Galaxy S8 \u2013 a full month after Mobile World Congress.\nAnd while the company is taking its time, lessons learned from the Note fiasco have apparently not precluded Samsung from going big with the device \u2013 quite literally, with a display that\u2019s said to be even larger than the phablet line. The device will reportedly arrive in two sizes: a very big 5.8-inch and a downright ridiculously massive 6.2-inch QHD Super AMOLED.\nSamsung\u2019s gotten quite good at jamming big screens into devices without making them too unwieldy in recent years, and part of the trickery this time out comes courtesy of familiar curved display, coupled with an abandoning of front navigation buttons.

The Trump administration has described the order as a move to prevent foreign terrorist entry into the U.S.\u00a0\nTech companies like Uber, Apple, Microsoft and Google are in touch with employees affected by the order, according to reports.

{"title": "Resistance and reluctance", "content": "Darrell Etherington @etherington / 2 years\nEvery Sunday, our daily newsletter \u00a0features a piece of\u00a0analysis and\u00a0opinion regarding the biggest stories of the week in tech. This Sunday, we\u2019re\u00a0republishing this week\u2019s daily newsletter column here in its entirety.\nResistance and reluctance:\u00a0Trump\u2019s most controversial act yet is a sweeping immigration order that bars refugees and even legitimate visa holders from a list of Muslim majority countries from entering the country. In an interview on Fox News on Sunday, Trump lieutenant\u00a0 Rudy Giuliani admitted Trump came to him and asked him for a way to create a Muslim ban \u00a0in a way that was legally acceptable. This is no longer something that anyone with any influence in tech can justifiably fail to oppose.\nAnd yet we see a range of responses from leaders and companies in and around Silicon Valley. We\u2019ve been tracking the various statements released, internal emails leaked, and actions taken by startups, tech giants, investors and more, and the range of responses is what you\u2019d expect from a group so varied and with such complicated relationships to Trump and his administration.\nEarly reaction from large companies including Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft has focused on the immediate impact of the order on employees, with these companies expressing support for, and offering legal assistance to employees affected. These also tended to include fairly mild admonitions about the potential impact on talent acquisition, but by and large they avoided strong or direct condemnation of the Trump administration actions on moral or values-based grounds.\nSome companies, including Airbnb, Twitter and Lyft are more explicitly admitting they oppose Trump\u2019s actions at a fundamental level. Lyft and investor Chris Sacca have gone further still, donating funds to the ACLU \u2013 Lyft will contribute $1 million over the next four years, in fact. Fred Wilson\u00a0 broke silence regarding Trump \u00a0maintained since his election and will be donating monthly to the ACLU as well.\nMeanwhile some of those with the most direct access to the White House have been more measured in their response. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who sits on not one, but two Trump industry advisory councils said on Twitter that the ban was \u201cnot the best way\u201d to address U.S. immigration challenges, for instance, and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he\u2019d \u201craise\u201d the issue of the order\u2019s unfairness at an upcoming advisory council meeting with Trump.\nSomewhat muted responses from a number of tech companies on Trump policy is to be expected: the responsibilities of executives at Google, Apple, Facebook and more are first and foremost to their companies and their employees, and they\u2019re clearly facing a balancing act of acting in good conscience while also protecting their corporate interests. The fact that they\u2019ve said as much as they have while faced with that dilemma speaks volumes to just how heinous Trump\u2019s actions have been.\nBut on the other side, companies that have been willing to work more closely with Trump are the ones who bear the bulk of responsibility for taking decisive action. The likely reason Musk, Kalanick, Thiel and others have cozied up to Trump to begin with is because they like his agenda of cutting down burdensome regulations, and they see an opportunity to manipulate him to help further their own goals and corporate interests.\nThe problem is that Trump is a ready and willing tool for the agenda of multiple actors, and much more dangerous factions have more direct and pervasive influence. Tech industry power players who sought to flourish under Trump by bending his ear should recognize this, and realize that this is not a situation where their muted response to his dangerous policy decisions can be excused by any potential favor they hope to curry for their larger goals.\nHopefully, the U.S. tech industry\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s immigration order is the start of a concerted and sustained effort to use the sector\u2019s power and influence to turn the country away from the dark path it appears headed down, and hopefully those who\u2019ve sought proximity to Trump in the past join in as well.\nGet the context:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-29T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "The multinational company is in trouble", "content": "Print edition | Leaders\nJan 28th 2017\nAMONG the many things that Donald Trump dislikes are big global firms. Faceless and rootless, they stand accused of unleashing \u201ccarnage\u201d on ordinary Americans by shipping jobs and factories abroad. His answer is to domesticate these marauding multinationals. Lower taxes will draw their cash home, border charges will hobble their cross-border supply chains and the trade deals that help them do business will be rewritten. To avoid punitive treatment, \u201call you have to do is stay,\u201d he told American bosses this week.\u00a0\nMr Trump is unusual in his aggressively protectionist tone. But in many ways he is behind the times. Multinational companies, the agents behind global integration, were already in retreat well before the populist revolts of 2016. Their financial performance has slipped so that they are no longer outstripping local firms. Many seem to have exhausted their ability to cut costs and taxes and to out-think their local competitors. Mr Trump\u2019s broadsides are aimed at companies that are surprisingly vulnerable and, in many cases, are already heading home. The impact on global commerce will be profound.\nGet our daily newsletter\nSee more\nThe end of the arbitrage\nMultinational firms (those that do a large chunk of their business outside their home region) employ only one in 50 of the world\u2019s workers. But they matter. A few thousand firms influence what billions of people watch, wear and eat. The likes of IBM, McDonald\u2019s, Ford, H&M, Infosys, Lenovo and Honda have been the benchmark for managers. They co-ordinate the supply chains that account for over 50% of all trade. They account for a third of the value of the world\u2019s stockmarkets and they own the lion\u2019s share of its intellectual property\u2014from lingerie designs to virtual-reality software and diabetes drugs.\nThey boomed in the early 1990s, as China and the former Soviet bloc opened and Europe integrated. Investors liked global firms\u2019 economies of scale and efficiency. Rather than running themselves as national fiefs, firms unbundled their functions. A Chinese factory might use tools from Germany, have owners in the United States, pay taxes in Luxembourg and sell to Japan. Governments in the rich world dreamed of their national champions becoming world-beaters. Governments in the emerging world welcomed the jobs, exports and technology that global firms brought. It was a golden age.\nCentral to the rise of the global firm was its claim to be a superior moneymaking machine. That claim lies in tatters (see Briefing ). In the past five years the profits of multinationals have dropped by 25%. Returns on capital have slipped to their lowest in two decades. A strong dollar and a low oil price explain part of the decline. Technology superstars and consumer firms with strong brands are still thriving. But the pain is too widespread and prolonged to be dismissed as a blip. About 40% of all multinationals make a return on equity of less than 10%, a yardstick for underperformance. In a majority of industries they are growing more slowly and are less profitable than local firms that stayed in their backyard. The share of global profits accounted for by multinationals has fallen from 35% a decade ago to 30% now. For many industrial, manufacturing, financial, natural-resources, media and telecoms companies, global reach has become a burden, not an advantage.\nThat is because a 30-year window of arbitrage is closing. Firms\u2019 tax bills have been massaged down as low as they can go; in China factory workers\u2019 wages are rising. Local firms have become more sophisticated. They can steal, copy or displace global firms\u2019 innovations without building costly offices and factories abroad. From America\u2019s shale industry to Brazilian banking, from Chinese e-commerce to Indian telecoms, the companies at the cutting edge are local, not global.\nThe changing political landscape is making things even harder for the giants. Mr Trump is the latest and most strident manifestation of a worldwide shift to grab more of the value that multinationals capture. China wants global firms to place not just their supply chains there, but also their brainiest activities such as research and development. Last year Europe and America battled over who gets the $13bn of tax that Apple and Pfizer pay annually. From Germany to Indonesia rules on takeovers, antitrust and data are tightening.\nMr Trump\u2019s arrival will only accelerate a gory process of restructuring. Many firms are simply too big: they will have to shrink their empires. Others are putting down deeper roots in the markets where they operate. General Electric and Siemens are \u201clocalising\u201d supply chains, production, jobs and tax into regional or national units. Another strategy is to become \u201cintangible\u201d. Silicon Valley\u2019s stars, from Uber to Google, are still expanding abroad. Fast-food firms and hotel chains are shifting from flipping burgers and making beds to selling branding rights. But such virtual multinationals are also vulnerable to populism because they create few direct jobs, pay little tax and are not protected by trade rules designed for physical goods.\nTaking back control\nThe retreat of global firms will give politicians a feeling of greater control as companies promise to do their bidding. But not every country can get a bigger share of the same firms\u2019 production, jobs and tax. And a rapid unwinding of the dominant form of business of the past 20 years could be chaotic. Many countries with trade deficits (including \u201cglobal Britain\u201d) rely on the flow of capital that multinationals bring. If firms\u2019 profits drop further, the value of stockmarkets will probably fall.\nWhat of consumers and voters? They touch screens, wear clothes and are kept healthy by the products of firms that they dislike as immoral, exploitative and aloof. The golden age of global firms has also been a golden age for consumer choice and efficiency. Its demise may make the world seem fairer. But the retreat of the multinational cannot bring back all the jobs that the likes of Mr Trump promise. And it will mean rising prices, diminishing competition and slowing innovation. In time, millions of small firms trading across borders could replace big firms as transmitters of ideas and capital. But their weight is tiny. People may yet look back on the era when global firms ruled the business world, and regret its passing.\nThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \"In retreat\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-28T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

In an email sent to users, Lyft noted that it is \u201cfirmly against these actions, and will not be silent to issues that threat the value of the community.\u201d\nThis is one of the strongest statements against Trump\u2019s unconstitutional executive orders from a tech company to date, and Lyft is also putting action behind its words: The ride hailing company also announced it will be donating $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over the next four years. The ACLU filed suit against Trump\u2019s administration for the refugee ban, and succeeded in getting a temporary stay of the order from a federal judge on Saturday.\nMany other Silicon Valley companies have expressed varying levels of opposition to the actions by Trump and his White House, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, but Lyft has done so with a public document (the messages from many others were shared via leaked internal employee emails) and with a clear articulation of why Trump\u2019s actions are wrong on a moral level, not just as a potential hindrance to acquiring top level global talent, or as a threat to current employees who enjoy U.S. visa status.\nUber\u2019s Travis Kalanick released an email to employees noting that the Lyft competitor would be working with drivers potentially affected to provide them legal assistance. He also said he\u2019d raise the issue of the ban\u2019s impact on \u201cinnocent people\u201d during a meeting with Trump\u2019s business advisory council on Friday, of which Kalanick is a member. Kalanick also acknowledged that many employees might disagree with his decision to join Trump\u2019s administration in an advisory capacity, and said they enjoy the right to do so. Uber employees have taken to Twitter to do just that , and the company faces calls to boycott its service, and saw physical protests at its San Francisco HQ as a result of Kalanick\u2019s involvement with Trump\u2019s White House.\nHere\u2019s the entire letter sent by Lyft:\nWe created Lyft to be a model for the type of community we want our world to be: diverse, inclusive and safe.\nThis weekend, Trump closed the country\u2019s borders to refugees, immigrants, and even documented residents from around the world based on their country of origin. Banning people of a particular faith or creed, race or identity, sexuality or ethnicity, from entering the U.S. is antithetical to both Lyft\u2019s and our nation\u2019s core values. We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community.\nWe know this directly impacts many of our community members, their families and friends. We stand with you, and are donating $1,000,000 over the next four years to the ACLU to defend our constitution. We ask that you continue to be there for each other \u2013 and together, continue proving the power of community.\nJohn & Logan\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-29T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The order would also affect L-1, E-2 and B1 visas.\nHowever, not everyone agrees that the draft order would make life more difficult for companies like Apple and Google. Since outsourcers from India have been the top recipients of H-1B visas, with others struggling to get them, one Harvard academic believes it may actually assist tech companies.\n\u201cIf firms are using the program for cheap labor, I think it will affect them and they will have to pay workers more,\u201d said Ron Hira, an associate professor at Howard University. \u201cIf tech firms are using the program for specialized labor, they may find there are more visas available.\u201d\nThe piece notes that it\u2019s unclear how much impact the executive order would have if signed, as Congress is already working on visa reform, including one bill specifically designed to tighten H-1B work visas.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-30T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple\u2019s new \u2018Shot on iPhone\u2019 billboard ads were all shot during the same night", "content": "Romain Dillet @romaindillet / 2 years\nApple is introducing a new billboard campaign today. The various \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d ads have been quite effective. Somehow, seeing a giant photo on a billboard and thinking that it was shot with the phone you could have in your pocket works quite well.\nOf course, Apple works with professional photographers who know what they\u2019re doing \u2014 my photos look nowhere as good . With the iPhone 7, Apple thought it was time to try something new.\nSo the company asked various photographers around the world, from Shanghai to South Africa, to capture some photos during the same night. On November 5, 2016, they all grabbed an iPhone 7, their favorite accessories and captured some great shots. Here are a few samples:\n[gallery ids=\"1445168,1445172,1445166,1445167,1445170\"]\nI talked with Scottish photographer Ruairidh Mcglynn who participated in Apple\u2019s campaign. He traveled to Iceland and rode a dog sled across the snow. At some point, he stopped for a break in an ice cave, and here\u2019s the result:\nMcglynn already uses the iPhone camera quite a lot and a small mirrorless camera system \u2014 this time, it was iPhone only. \u201cAs well as the challenge of capturing images at night, the conditions in Iceland were at times harsh; howling wind, cold rain and sub-zero temperatures all added to this challenge,\u201d Mcglynn told me. \u201cThe iPhone is extremely robust and the harsh weather didn\u2019t seem to faze the handset.\u201d\nMany night photographers could tell you that a tripod can help you when it comes to long exposure. Mcglynn used a RetiCAM mount combined with a traditional tripod. Pro tip: you can also use the EarPods as a remote shutter release. Just launch the camera app and press the button on the EarPods remote.\n\u201cThe brief was technically challenging and most people would think not possible using a mobile device,\u201d Mcglynn said. \u201cThe camera exceeded my expectations and has changed my perceptions of what\u2019s possible using a smartphone.\u201d\nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus come with optical image stabilization and an f/1.8 aperture. It\u2019s a significant improvement over the iPhone 6s camera when it comes to low light photography.

{"title": "Apple revenue could grow again thanks to the iPhone 7", "content": "Romain Dillet @romaindillet / 2 years\nApple will report its holiday quarter earnings tomorrow. Once again, all eyes will be on the iPhone. The device now represents the vast majority of the company\u2019s revenue. So anything that can affect iPhone sales is a big deal.\nAnd if you\u2019ve been paying attention to Apple\u2019s past earnings , you know that Apple has had a complicated year. In short, revenue has been down for three straight quarters. Analysts have been wondering whether Apple\u2019s incredible run was over. Maybe Apple\u2019s revenue has peaked?\nIt turns out that this quarter should be the first quarter during which Apple\u2019s revenue grew again. Analysts are currently expecting $77.4 billion in revenue compared to $75.8 billion last year (up 2.1 percent). This is in line with Apple\u2019s own forecasts as the company said it was expecting between $76 billion and $78 billion during last quarter\u2019s earnings release.\niPhone sales should be up slightly with 78 million iPhones sold during the holiday quarter compared to 75 million a year ago. It\u2019s hard to grasp such a big number. Analysts think that Apple has sold roughly 590 iPhones per minute. I don\u2019t even know how Apple can produce them so quickly.\nSo that\u2019s the big picture. If you\u2019re not really into numbers, there are a few things that are going to be interesting. The MacBook Pro got a big refresh . It wasn\u2019t available until the middle of the quarter, but it could have a significant impact on Mac sales in general. It\u2019s been a bit stale on this front for quite a while, so this could be exciting.\nThe Apple Watch also received an update . But Apple doesn\u2019t generally break out Apple Watch sales numbers. In December, Tim Cook said that Apple Watch sales were doing just fine . An IDC report wasn\u2019t so optimistic about wearables in general. It\u2019s clear that the Apple Watch isn\u2019t going to change \u201cthe iPhone company\u201d into a company with multiple widely successful products.\nFinally, Apple likes to brand itself as a product and service company now. Let\u2019s see how Apple\u2019s services are doing this quarter. With Super Mario Run and a ton of new iPhones, revenue from services should be up. But does it represent a significant chunk of Apple\u2019s bottom line? Not yet, probably.\nI\u2019m particularly excited about the earnings call with Apple executives. There are so many burning questions with Apple right now. Tim Cook won\u2019t answer them all, but at least we might get a few hints. In particular, I want to know more about all the recent Apple car rumors , demand in China, the Qualcomm lawsuit and (yes) Trump.\n[gallery ids=\"1445709,1445710,1445711,1445712,1445713,1445714,1445715\"]\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-30T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Starting today, Square merchants won\u2019t pay any processing fee for the first $12,000 in Apple Pay transactions \u2014 that represents around $350 in fees.\nIn addition to this promotion, sellers can also get a free marketing kit (with Apple Pay stickers probably) and training materials to tell employees how Apple Pay works. You\u2019ll need Square\u2019s chip credit card reader that also support contactless payments, such as Apple Pay and Android Pay.\nIn the press release, Square Hardware Lead Jesse Dorogusker says that Apple is involved with this partnership. \u201cAnything we can do to make a seller\u2019s experience faster and safer, including working with Apple to encourage Apple Pay usage, is an investment worth making,\u201d Dorogusker said.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Apple reduced Apple Pay\u2019s fees for Square merchants in order to drive more Apple Pay purchases. Maybe Square also noticed that there\u2019s less fraud with Apple Pay purchases \u2014 this way, Square could save money.\nWhile Apple Pay has been around for a while, many people still don\u2019t know how to use it. After you realize that you can trigger Apple Pay by double tapping on the home button when your phone is locked, it becomes clear that it\u2019s easier than paying with your credit card.\nSquare has already tried educating merchants and customers about Apple Pay in Portland. After the company\u2019s campaign, contactless payments, such as Apple Pay payments, tripled.\nIt\u2019s interesting to see that Apple can be more aggressive about Apple Pay with partnerships such as today\u2019s program with Square.

Also rumored to be unveiled on Feb. 9 is Google\u2019s first foray into wearable hardware, in the form of a watch co-developed with LG. We may have just gotten our first clear look at the device (and its price).\nAfter a pair of low-resolution images surfaced last week, serial leaker Evan Blass posted what is almost certain to be renders of the new LG Watch Style, which Android Police claims will cost $250. Not only does it match with the image that circulated last week, it also jibes with the rumors that had previously been reported. Blass claims that the two models pictured show the watch in silver and rose gold finishes, two of the three colors reportedly available for purchase (along with titanium).\nThe picture shows the two case colors paired with two different-colored bands, though Blass has previously said Google will sell a line of interchangeable straps for the two models. Additionally, the watch is expected to feature a 1.2-inch, 360x360 display, 512MB of RAM, and a 240mAh battery. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are reportedly built in, but cellular connectivity, GPS, and NFC are said to be reserved for the larger, presumably more expensive model.\nThe bigger Sport model is rumored to include a 1.38-inch, 480x480 screen, 756MB of RAM, and a 430mAh battery. Both watches will also apparently include a navigational crown similar to the one Apple uses on its watch, which the picture Blass supplies clearly shows. It\u2019s unclear exactly what functions the digital crown will perform, but it would represent the first such navigational device on an Android Wear watch.\nWill you want one: It seems like we've been waiting forever for Android Wear 2.0 arrive, and now that it's finally almost here, we're going to need a whole new lineup of watches to take advantage of all of the new features. While the new navigation and messaging features will certainly make older watches feel new again, one of the best features, Android Pay, will need newer hardware to get the full phone-free experience. While they look nice, the Style watch pictured here reportedly won't include an NFC chip, and thus won't be able to make payments on the go. That could end up making it feel outdated right from the start.\nThis story, \"Leaked images reveal the LG Watch Style, Google's first Android Wear 2.0 device\" was originally published by Greenbot\n.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-30T12:34:00Z", "images": []}

Prior to this, Apple had, in a limited manner, opened up its App Store to Iranians in September 2016 and appeared to be gradually lifting some of the limitations, periodically, since then.\nAccording to credible tech news site Techrasa , the biggest Iranian e-commerce service, Digikala , which has millions of users, had its app removed from the App Store just a few days ago.\nWhile there is no official App Store available for the territory of Iran, many companies registered their apps as being outside of Iran to be able to get onto the store.\nDigikala uses the Shaparak payment system which is completely isolated from international systems, so would in theory not contravene Apple\u2019s T&Cs.\nIn addition, several banks in Iran have apps for the iOS platform which are often side-loaded onto phones.\nIranians are \u2018gadget-mad\u2019, with an estimated 40M smartphones in the country, of which there are an estimated 6M iPhones.

{"title": "Nextbit Robin phone will be no more as new owner Razer steps in", "content": "CNET\nNextbit Robin phone will be no more as new owner Razer steps in\nRobin phones will see software support for the next year, but don't expect a sequel soon.\nby\nJanuary 30, 2017 3:00 PM PST\nJosh Miller\nHaving hatched its cloud-based Robin phone with a Kickstarter campaign, it's time for hardware startup Nextbit to find its next nest. And it's a move that may surprise you.\nOn Monday, gaming hardware maker Razer announced that it acquired all 30 members of the Nextbit team. Razer wowed this year's CES with a gaming laptop fitted with three screens whereas the Robin was intentionally stripped-down; the two companies are hardly birds of a feather. Still, Razer's deeper pockets will give Nextbit's team, which includes veterans of Google and HTC, more resources to develop and distribute products.\n\"Joining up with Razer will allow us to reach much further,\" said Nextbit cofounder Tom Moss. Moss will continue as Nextbit's CEO under Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan.\nWhile Nextbit will remain an independently operated unit that designs and develops products, don't hold your breath for another round of Robin anytime soon. Although Razer plans to hang on to the Nextbit and Robin names, Moss said, another Robin phone isn't on the radar for now. In fact, Nextbit has since stopped direct sales (it sold out of inventory through its website), though you can still buy the phone on Amazon.\n20 Photos\nEven though the Robin 2 seems unlikely for now, Nextbit isn't abandoning its chick entirely. Robin owners will receive software support through February 2018 and Razer will supply 6 months of hardware warranty support.\n\"As for future products,\" Moss told CNET, \"I'm strictly forbidden from breathing a word about them.\" They won't necessarily be gaming related, he added.\nNeither Razer nor Nextbit revealed what the deal is worth.\nRobin looked to the cloud to break the phone mold\nNextbit entered the phone scene in 2015 when it announced that it would create a \"friggin' awesome\" cloud-first phone that would save space by keeping lesser-used apps online and downloading them when you need them. It would look different and cost about half of a top-shelf phone.\nThat was certainly a departure from your typical black or silver rectangle that sought to add more storage for a premium. Why not start with less onboard storage, to make it cheaper, and use an internet-based locker system for the rest? That was Nextbit's response.\nThe Robin, which launched as a Kickstarter campaign less than a month later, was more than a pipe dream. Staffed by industry veterans like Moss, formerly of Google, and one-time HTC design chief Scott Croyle, the fledgling company managed to build both excitement and community in a mature market already choked with much higher-profile brands struggling to keep their own foothold.\nThe Robin was a mixed bag when it arrived, but it retained its independent design and cloud-based focus through software updates for its niche following. It even added a third color, red .\nNextbit declined to share how many Robin phones it's sold, but it wouldn't have made a dent in sales by global titans Samsung and Apple. As a partly crowdfunded project (about 10 percent; Nextbit relied on VC backers including Google Ventures and Accel), the Robin was able to deliver on its product promise and attract Razer's acquisition.\nWas the Robin the Cinderella story Nextbit may have hoped for? No, but it was successful enough to spark hope for other phone upstarts with a unique spin.\nNow playing: Watch this: 3 ways your Nextbit Robin is about to get better\n1:21\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-30T23:00:00Z", "images": []}

The shareholders further detailed their proposal in Tuesday's filing.\nThe proposal will go up for a\u00a0vote on Feb. 28 at Apple's annual shareholder meeting, held in Cupertino.\nApple has asked shareholders to vote down the proposal for several reasons. The company wants to focus on diversity across the company, and not just the senior management and board, it said. Moreover, the company is actively seeking out minority and women for top positions.\nIt also doesn't want the diversity policy to affect the recruitment process.\n\"We believe that the proposal is unduly burdensome and not necessary because Apple has demonstrated to shareholders its commitment to inclusion and diversity, which are core values for our company,\" Apple said in its opposition.\nBut the shareholder rebuttal points out a lack of diversity in Apple's current top management, with about 10 percent of posts occupied by minorities. It also points out that many top technology companies like Microsoft and Intel have established recruitment procedures that promote\u00a0diversity.\nApple has taken steps toward being inclusive. Apple's CEO Tim Cook is gay, and one of the company's highest paid executive is Angela Ahrendts, senior vice president of retail.\nApple has put up a website where the company shares its diversity statistics. About 37 percent of the new hires from June 2015 to June 2016 were women, growing from 35 percent in 2015. About 27 percent of the new hires in the same period were underrepresented minorities, including 13 percent black hires and 13 percent Hispanic, growing from 24 percent for the same period over 2014 and 2015.\nNot included in those one-year statistics ending June 2016 were Asians, who represented 24 percent of the new hires. Whites were 46 percent of the new hires.\nTying diversity to hiring practices has some advantages. Intel said that such a practice helps sales as it gives a better idea of how to better target products at diverse communities. Moreover, it encourages a new generation of women and minorities to get involved in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields.\nThe technology industry has for long been perceived as being sexist. In a 2014 interview, Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella said that not asking for pay raises is \u201cgood karma\u201d for women. Intel came under fire for getting involved in GamerGate, a controversy over women\u2019s influence and participation in gaming.\nHowever, the chipmaker and other companies like Facebook have had trouble increasing their hires of minorities and women, with progress being slow.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The Thunderbolt 3-capable display apparently suffers from signal interference, rendering the monitor unusable when it\u2019s within 6.5 feet or so of a wireless router.\u00a0\nYou can find several reviews on Apple\u2019s site complaining about this problem, but 9to5 Mac\u2019s Zac Hall recently gave us a front row seat to this issue. Hall brought the 5K display home for his personal set up and immediately discovered the problem.\nThis appears to be a known issue, according to Hall, with LG Support recommending to keep the monitor away from wireless access points. The UltraFine monitor\u2019s manual also says in its warnings section to install the monitor where \u201cno electromagnetic interference\u201d occurs; however, the manual doesn\u2019t mention what might cause this interference.\nApple began selling LG\u2019s UltraFine 4K and 5K monitors in its online store in December. The 5K monitor is recommended as the next-generation replacement for Apple\u2019s own Thunderbolt Display , which was discontinued last summer.\nThe monitor features 5120-by-2880 resolution with a P3 wide color gamut, Thunderbolt 3 for input, three USB-C (USB 3.1 gen 1) ports, a built-in camera, and stereo speakers. The monitor is currently available at the special price of $974 through the end of March.\nThe impact on you at home: LG\u2019s display is certainly stunning, but it could be problematic for people who cram their computer, printer, and router into one corner of the house. If that\u2019s you, and you do plan on buying LG\u2019s 5K display, then you should probably see if your router can be moved elsewhere in the house. Even if the router issue doesn\u2019t affect you it\u2019s worth reading through the reviews of the monitor on Apple\u2019s site. At this writing there were only three complaints referring to routers, while others complained of problems with disconnections and crashing on wake.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to LG to see if the router proximity issue can be fixed with a firmware update, but it sounds like a crucial piece of the monitor isn't protected well enough against electromagnetic radiation\u2014which wouldn't be easily fixed by a firmware tweak. Hopefully we'll hear back soon.\nThis story, \"LG's 5K monitor doesn't work near Wi-Fi routers\" was originally published by Macworld\n.\nTo comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-31T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac, and Apple Watch,\u201d said CEO Tim Cook. \u201cRevenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline,\u201d the company wrote in its letter to investors.\nThe company took in $78.4 billion in revenue and sold 78 million iPhones. The last few quarters have marked the end of an incredible growth spurt for Apple. After more than a decade of record setting sales and revenue gains, the momentum around iPhone sales finally tapered off. Business around the iPad has also been sluggish. The introduction of the iPhone 7 has helped to end that slump, and Cook said on today\u2019s earnings call that the Apple Watch had its best quarter ever.\nCustomers are picking the more expensive models\nApple reported a profit of $17.8 billion, and said its earnings per share were boosted by the high demand for the larger models of its iPhones , which have higher margins. On the earnings call, Chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that customer satisfaction with iPads, and the new iPad pro, was very high. He predicted strong growth in that category. But the sales figures don\u2019t reflect that optimism, with unit sales and revenue from iPad both down around 20 percent year over year.\nWith over a billion iOS devices active around the world, Apple has been able to shore up its flagging hardware sales growth with an increase in revenue from services to those devices. This includes money from Apple Pay, iCloud storage, Apple Music, and App Store sales. It was by far the fastest-growing segment of Apple\u2019s revenue this quarter, climbing 18 percent to $7.17 billion since the same period last year. Cook said Apple is aiming to double service revenue over the next four years. Maestri said Apple\u2019s App Store had double the revenue of Google\u2019s Play Store in 2016.\nThe story of Apple business during 2015 was the incredible expansion of its business in China . Revenue surged over 100 percent during certain quarters, and Apple laid out ambitious plans for retail stores across the country. All that has changed over the last year, however, with increasing competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, ZTE, Oppo, Vivo, and Lenovo. \"Once Apple's most promising geographical growth opportunity, the Chinese market has actually transitioned into its biggest geographical sales deficit,\u201d said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst with Investing.com . That trend continued this quarter, with revenue from China declining 12 percent year over year.\nApple has more than $200 billion in cash parked overseas. Cook said on today\u2019s call that he was optimistic about tax reform in the US happening this year, and that this might allow Apple to bring a lot of that money back home. \u201cWith our toe in the water, we\u2019re learning a lot about the original content business,\u201d Cook said, hinting at one way Apple might deploy all that capital.\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus review\nMore From The Verge\nMost Read\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-01-31T21:41:49Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Report: Apple-developed ARM chip may appear in updated MacBook Pro this year", "content": "Report: Apple-developed ARM chip may appear in updated MacBook Pro this year\nReddit\nBloomberg\u00a0 reports that Apple is currently developing a new ARM-based chip that could appear in future MacBook Pros as soon as this year. According to the report, the new Mac chip may be used for low-power tasks that currently rely on Intel\u2019s chip to process.\nThe report does not detail a full switch to ARM chips for the Mac, however, noting that Macs will still rely on Intel processors unlike iPhones and iPads which are totally ARM-based. Issues with Intel preparing new chips in time to be used with Macs has fueled speculation that Apple could eventually switch to ARM-based chips in the future.\nFor now, the new ARM chip would potentially be used for dedicated tasks like maintaining background app activity which could preserve battery life.\nThe updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer\u2019s low-power mode functionality, they said. [\u2026]\nApple engineers are planning to offload the Mac\u2019s low-power mode, a feature marketed as \u201cPower Nap,\u201d to the next-generation ARM-based chip.\nThe report specifies that Apple may be planning to introduce the new chip in updated MacBook Pros as soon as this year.\nThe new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said.\nRelying on a dedicated chip for specific tasks could be a benefit to battery life which has been an issue with\u00a0Apple\u2019s latest MacBooks Pro models. iPhone, for example, features a dedicated co-processor that focuses on step tracking and listening for the \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 voice prompt.\nApple already includes a custom ARM chip called the T1 with its latest MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar and Touch ID.\nSeparately, new\u00a0models of the MacBook Pro are expected to take advantage of Intel\u2019s new Kaby Lake generation chips and and step up to 32 GB of RAM on notebooks which has not yet been an option. Apple is also expected to be preparing new iMacs with updated specs including USB-C after the last refresh occurred over a year ago.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "iPhone 7 sales helped Apple reclaim the top spot in the global smartphone market", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\niPhone 7 sales put Apple back on top as the world\u2019s top smartphone vendor in the fourth quarter, according to a new report from Strategy Analytics, which attributed at least some of the growth to Apple\u2019s ability to capitalize\u00a0on Samsung\u2019s recent missteps. The latter, of course, is referring to the Note 7 battery recall , which had led to exploding devices due to design defects.\nIn addition, smartphone growth as a whole recovered slightly in major developing markets, the report said, including China and Africa.\nIn Apple\u2019s earnings, released this week, the company reported selling 78.3 million iPhones, higher than Wall Street\u2019s forecasts of 76.3 million in the holiday quarter.\nStrategy\u2019s report puts this figure into further context, saying that Apple captured just under\u00a018 percent of the smartphone market\u00a0in the quarter, rising 5 percent from the 74.8 million units shipped over the same period last year.\n\u201cThis was the iPhone\u2019s best performance for over a year, as Apple capitalized on Samsung\u2019s recent missteps. Samsung shipped 77.5 million smartphones worldwide in Q4 2016, dipping 5 percent annually from 81.3 million units in Q4 2015,\u201d said Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, in a statement.\nMawston explained\u00a0how Samsung lost momentum because of the Note 7 fiasco. Samsung captured 17.7 percent market share in Q4 compared with Apple\u2019s 17.8 percent, which gave Apple the lead once again, if only slightly. Samsung\u2019s market share, which resulted in a 21 percent share for the full year, was its lowest level since 2011, he also said. However, on an annualized basis, Samsung maintained first position with 309 million units shipped worldwide in 2016, the report notes.\nFor Samsung, the company is hoping for a return to growth when it releases its rumored\u00a0Galaxy S8 model in a few weeks.\nIn addition to the Apple vs Samsung battle, the market overall saw growth of its own in Q4. Global shipments grew 3 percent year-over-year from 1.44 billion in 2015 to a record 1.49 billion in 2016.\nHuawei earned the third position in the quarter, with 10 percent market share \u2013 the first time that the company had reached the double digits. The brand has struggled against rivals at home in China, but saw\u00a0improved performance in Western Europe.\nMeanwhile, OPPO came in in the fourth spot, with a 7 percent share of the global smartphone market after nearly doubling from 4 percent a year ago. Its growth is being attributed to popularity in China, and now it\u2019s preparing to expand into other emerging markets, like India and Nigeria.\nIndia, it\u2019s worth noting, is becoming the new battleground for these smartphone vendors. With increasing competition from local players, Apple has more recently turned its sights on India, where sales are booming thanks to a growing population, where half are under the age of 25 , and a growing middle class.\nAs Apple CEO Tim Cook noted on the earnings call this week, the strong U.S. dollar had hurt revenues in both China and India, but Apple was still bullish on India in particular.\n\u201cDespite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that we had all-time record revenue results,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo we were very happy about that. I feel really good about how we\u2019re doing [in India]. It\u2019s a great place to be.\u201d\nApple didn\u2019t break out its figures for India, but Cook did say Apple recorded \u201crecord revenue\u201d in the market, and noted the company planned to invest in the region, including retail stores.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Apple Watch drove growth and dominated with 63 percent global smartwatch marketshare, while Samsung maintained second position.\nNeil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said, \u201cGlobal smartwatch shipments grew 1 percent annually from 8.1 million units in Q4 2015 to 8.2 million in Q4 2016. The fourth quarter marked a return to growth for the smartwatch industry after two consecutive quarters of declining volumes. Smartwatch growth is recovering slightly due to new product launches from giant Apple and stronger seasonal demand in major developed markets like the US and UK. Global smartwatch shipments grew 1 percent annually from 20.8 million in full-year 2015 to a record 21.1 million in 2016.\u201d\nCliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, \u201cWe estimate Apple shipped a record 5.2 million smartwatches worldwide and captured a dominant 63 percent marketshare in Q4 2016, rising a steady 2 percent annually from 5.1 million units in Q4 2015. Demand for Apple\u2019s new Watch Series 2 as a holiday-season gift in Western markets was surprisingly strong and it enabled Apple to clear a large backlog of smartwatch inventory during the quarter.\u201d\nSteven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, added, \u201cWe estimate Samsung shipped 0.8 million smartwatches worldwide in Q4 2016, dipping 38 percent annually from 1.3 million units in Q4 2015. Samsung introduced its new flagship Gear S3 model relatively late in the quarter and this impacted negatively its overall smartwatch performance. Combined together, Apple and Samsung today account for an impressive 3 in 4 of all smartwatches shipped globally and they are a long way ahead of trailing rivals such as Garmin, Fitbit and Huawei.\u201d\nCliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, \u201cThe smartwatch industry is showing tentative signs of recovery this year, but it is not fully out of the woods just yet and there remain several barriers to growth that must be addressed. Smartwatch vendors like Samsung need to launch more exciting or cheaper models, Apple must engage closer with mobile operators to stock or subsidize its popular Watch portfolio, while component makers need to develop more accurate sensors for health and fitness tracking that consumers will trust and use more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Tablet Market Woes Continue as Growth in Detachable Tablets Takes Its First Vacation During the Holiday Season, According to IDC", "content": "Tablet Market Woes Continue as Growth in Detachable Tablets Takes Its First Vacation During the Holiday Season, According to IDC\nFebruary 02, 2017 08:30 AM Eastern Standard Time\nFRAMINGHAM, Mass.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Consumer spending during the holiday quarter of 2016 was clearly not aimed at consuming tablets as the market continued its spiraling decline. The fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16) marked the ninth consecutive quarter that tablet shipments have declined. According to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation ( IDC ) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker , vendors shipped 52.9 million tablets in the fourth quarter, which was a decline of 20.1% from the same quarter one year ago. Similarly, shipments of 174.8 million units for the full year 2016 were down 15.6% compared to 2015, marking the second straight year of declining shipments.\n\"The sentiment around the tablet market continues to grow stale despite a lot of talk about vendors pivoting their product portfolios toward the detachable segment,\" said Ryan Reith , program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers . \"Typical tablets without a dedicated keyboard, which IDC refers to as slate tablets, are continuing to lose relevancy across all regions and, as a result, we see the decline happening globally. We do see future growth in some emerging markets like the Middle East & Africa as well as Central & Eastern Europe with the sole catalysts being simplicity and low cost. Unfortunately for the industry these are the devices that don't equate to large revenues.\"\nVendors that have historically led the notebook PC market are also talking about expanding their product portfolios to include more detachable tablets, although currently there is more talk than action. As a result, Apple and Microsoft are dominating the detachable tablet segment. IDC believes the second half of 2017 will bring a wide range of new detachable devices from the notebook PC OEMs as well as those playing primarily in the smartphone space.\nYet even detachable tablets struggled to maintain momentum in the fourth quarter as flagship products from key players like Microsoft and Apple started to show signs of age. \"The market continues to warm up to two-in-one devices, but we're now getting to a point where the price and performance disparity between detachables and convertibles has started to narrow, and this added competition led to a dampening in the growth of detachable tablets,\" said Jitesh Ubrani , senior research analyst with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers . \"However, we expect this to be temporary as only two of the three major platforms have any significant hardware presence in the detachable market, and as the ecosystems are further refined with future updates and developer support.\"\nTablet Vendor Highlights\nApple's venerable hold on the tablet market is yet to be challenged although the company is not immune to overall market challenges, declining 18.8% in 4Q16. The iPad Pro lineup made up only a small portion of overall shipments as the iPad Air 2 and Mini tablets continued to account for the majority of the shipments for Apple. For every 10 slate tablets shipped, Apple only sold 1 iPad Pro tablet.\nSamsung remained the number two tablet vendor in the holiday season capturing 15.1% market share on 8 million shipments. The bad news is that this was down -11.4% from the holiday quarter in 2015. The Tab S2 and Tab A continue to be the strongest models for Samsung and its largest markets for tablet consumption continue to be the United States, Europe, and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan).\nAmazon's Fire tablets continued their hot streak, earning the company third place overall in 4Q16. The already low cost tablets were further discounted during the Black Friday sales period although this was still not enough to stave off an annual decline. However, it is important to note that Amazon is in the unique position where tablet market share is likely not of significant importance as the company remains highly focused on acquiring additional Prime subscribers regardless of the type of device used.\nLenovo was one of the two vendors to grow in the 4Q16 and managed to gain 2.1 percentage points in 4Q16 over the same period in 2015. With a broad lineup and innovative designs, IDC expects this vendor will be one to watch in 2017.\nOutside of price, Huawei's value proposition is cellular connectivity and this was evidenced in their portfolio as the majority of their tablets offered built-in 3G or 4G connectivity. To date, the Chinese company has done well in expanding their reach to Asian, European, and Middle Eastern markets, though their tablet presence in the U.S. is close to non-existent.\n\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-02T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Outlook for iOS speeds up work with third-party add ins", "content": "Outlook for iOS speeds up work with third-party add ins\nOutlook for iOS speeds up work with third-party add ins\nAndroid support coming soon to help people process email without leaving mobile Outlook\nComments\nUsers of Microsoft's Outlook app for iPhone and iPad can now get work done quicker using third-party integrations.\nAs of Thursday, Outlook for iOS supports add-ins, which let software companies build extensions to their own products that interact with emails in Outlook on a user\u2019s smartphone and tablet. At launch, the app supports add-ins from Evernote, GIPHY, Nimble, Trello and Smartsheet, in addition to those that Microsoft has created.\nFor example, users will be able to translate emails using a Microsoft Translator add-in, add cards to a Trello board straight from their email and quickly reply to an email thread with a funny animated GIF.\nThe add-in system is aimed at solving one of the key problems with handling email on a smartphone. Messages often require users to take action in one way or another, which can often require information from a different application or service. These add-ins are supposed to help users be more productive by letting them stay inside Outlook.\nHere\u2019s how it works: users go into the Outlook for iOS settings panel and tap the Add-Ins menu. After that, they\u2019ll see a list of potential add-ins for the app, and can tap the plus symbol to add them. After that, users will be able to invoke the add-ins when reading email by tapping the symbol that appears in the upper-right-hand corner of the messages they read, underneath the reply button.\nEach add-in has its own behavior, specific to the service that built it. For example, Nimble\u2019s add-in will show users information about the sender and recipients of an email. At this point, however, add-ins can only be invoked when users are reading email. Javier Soltero, the corporate vice president of Outlook at Microsoft, said that the company is working on making it possible to use add-ins in other contexts, such as writing emails.\nWhen asked about his company\u2019s process of developing an Outlook add-in for iOS, Smartsheet CEO Mark Mader said that Microsoft\u2019s developer tools were \u201cbest in class.\u201d But beyond that, the tech titan provided additional help and input with add-in development.\nApple already introduced an Extensions feature in iOS 8, but Soltero said it\u2019s not right for Microsoft\u2019s purposes. In his view, Apple\u2019s design is based on a series of events that users don\u2019t typically follow. To email a picture, users find the photo in their Photos app, then open the share sheet and send the photo to Outlook for inclusion in an email.\nMicrosoft\u2019s add-ins work differently.\n\u201cYou know what you\u2019re going to do, you\u2019re going to send a message, and what you include in that message is the other consideration,\u201d he said. \u201cSimilarly, you receive the email, and then [can] act on it with these add-ins.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also a question of user demand. While Smartsheet has existing apps for the iPhone and iPad, the company hasn\u2019t seen much interest in iOS extensions from enterprises.\nAnother advantage for Microsoft to using these add-ins instead of Apple\u2019s built-in functionality is that they interoperate with Outlook on other platforms, including Outlook 2013 and 2016 for Windows. Soltero said that add-in support is coming soon to Outlook 2016 for MacOS, too.\nMader said that Smartsheet has found good add-in design works well across both desktop and mobile, but that user experience should be tailored for each platform.\nRight now, the add-ins are available for Office 365 commercial customers using Outlook for iOS. The functionality is also slowly rolling out to Outlook.com users. Microsoft said that similar functionality for Outlook on Android will be available \u201csoon.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": null, "images": []}

{"title": "Apple could be working on ARM-based Mac chips to make Mac laptops more efficient", "content": "Romain Dillet @romaindillet / 2 years\nApple is already using an ARM-based chip in the latest MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor. According to a new report from Bloomberg , the company could go one step further and use the co-processor to offload some tasks.\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about the co-processor in the MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and how it currently works. Called the T1, the chip was designed by Apple and is not that powerful.\nIn fact, the T1 is the same chip as the one in the Apple Watch Series 2. The Touch Bar runs a flavor of watchOS customized for very specific features. The T1 runs the Secure Enclave so you can store personal information, such as your fingerprints and your keychain, and your computer won\u2019t ever see this information.\nSo when you\u2019re using your Mac, it\u2019s like there are two computers running and talking to each other. The main Intel processor does the heavy lifting, and the T1 handles very specific features.\nBut the T1 and the Intel Core i5 or i7 in your MacBook run two very different operating systems. The T1 is an ARM -based chip and can only run code that was compiled for ARM chips. The Intel chip runs x86 code. Just like on your iPhone, you can\u2019t simply run iTunes on the T1 \u2014 it needs to be optimized for ARM processors.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s report, Apple is thinking about expanding the tasks of the T1 with a new, more powerful chip. The updated chip could be codenamed the T310 and it won\u2019t replace the Intel chip \u2014 it\u2019s going to be another co-processor, but with more responsibilities.\nFor instance, Bloomberg says that your Mac would only use the T310 for Power Nap. Apple introduced Power Nap in 2012. This feature silently wakes your computer when it\u2019s sleeping to sync your iCloud data, fetch your emails and calendar events, upload photos to iCloud and even perform small Time Machine backups. This way, when you use your laptop again, your computer isn\u2019t playing catch-up.\nIt would take quite a lot of work to offload Power Nap to the T310. The T310 would need to connect to your Wi-Fi network thanks to an ARM-based Wi-Fi driver, load macOS services, such as iCloud syncing services and more.\nMany drivers and basic OS features would need to be compiled for both the Intel chip and the ARM chip. But the good news is that Apple has already done a lot of this work for iOS. iPhones and iPads can already perform many of these tasks, and sometimes better than macOS.\nFor instance, in my experience, the Wi-Fi stack works much better on iOS compared to macOS. You are able to connect to a spotty Wi-Fi network and get much better performance on your iPad.\nIn addition to that, ARM-based chips are much more power efficient than Intel chips. By offloading some tasks to the T310, Apple would be able to get much better battery life.\nBut does it mean that the T310 will be able to communicate directly with the Wi-Fi module in your Mac? Does it mean that all the networking will be done by the T310 even when you\u2019re using your Mac? That would mean that the line between the ARM-based chip and the Intel chip would get blurry, and this is when it could get interesting.\nI don\u2019t see Apple ditching Intel any time soon. Using Intel chips still makes a lot of sense . But it seems likely that all the research and development that went into creating Apple\u2019s chips for iOS devices is going to get reused in future MacBooks.\nWhile the Touch Bar is an interesting input device, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Behind the scene, Apple could be preparing some major changes for the MacBook product line.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-02T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Markets Live: Week of worries for ASX", "content": "More\n3.55pm on Feb 3, 2017\nAs six of Australia's worst-performing listed companies lost $11 billion in value in just six months, well-timed sales by \"insiders\" helped them avoid the sharp falls that followed profit warnings, downgrades and other corporate disasters.\nSignificant insider selling was evident at the four worst-performing companies in the S&P/ASX 200 over six months and four out of the 10 worst-performing stocks in the S&P/ASX 100 Index over that period, as directors and management were spared losses by the good timing of their sales.\nIn total nine executives and directors sold shares in Aconex, Sirtex Medical, Bellamy's Australia, Vocus Group, Healthscope and Brambles worth $60 million since late August. These shares would now be worth just $32 million as of this week.\nHugh Dive of funds management firm Atlas Funds Management described 2016 as \"a banner year for the informational value of insider trades\".\n\"We see that a consistently under-appreciated source of intelligence as to the future prospects for an individual company is trading in that company by insiders,\" he says.\nThe leaders of former market darlings Bellamy's, Aconex and Sirtex sold shares ahead of these companies more than halving in value as a string of downgrades rattled investor confidence and sent prices tumbling.\nMeanwhile, top 100 companies Vocus, Brambles and Healthscope all surprised investors with earnings downgrades months after senior executives and directors had sold shares.\nShares in construction software company Aconex fell 45 per cent this week after it downgraded its earnings. But co-founders Rob Phillpot and Leigh Jasper sold 375,000 shares at a price that was $1.2 million higher than their current value since they last reported earnings last August.\nOne of the largest insider sales was executed by James Spenceley, the founder of telco Vocus, who sold 3.2 million shares for $26.6 million in August as he moved on to set up his funds management firm . Those shares would now be worth $13.2 million, meaning Spenceley avoided a potential loss of more than $12 million.\nTony Grist, the founder of Amcom, which was acquired by Vocus in 2015, sold 1.185 million shares, which has since halved in value, at about the same time.\nThe pair left the board in October after their attempt to replace the chief executive failed. Vocus is the worst performer in the S&P/ASX 100 over six months, declining by 54 per cent.\nMore\n3.36pm on Feb 3, 2017\nCrown Resorts should have known its focus on drawing Chinese high rollers to its casinos was a hugely risky strategy, according to a law firm seeking to launch a shareholder class action against James Packer's gaming giant.\nSolicitors Maurice Blackburn today invited Crown shareholders to join in a potential class action to seek compensation for the share price drop that followed the detention in China of 18 Crown employees amid a clampdown on the illegal promotion of gambling and the illicit outflow of money from the country.\nCrown shares fell 14 per cent in one day, wiping more than $1.3 billion off Crown's market value. Shares are down 1.1 per cent at $11.14 today.\nMaurice Blackburn class actions principal Julian Schimmel said Crown should have notified shareholders of the risks associated with its strategy well before the detentions, which included the arrest of three Australians.\n\"We have reason to believe that: one, Crown knew the risks of its activities in China; two, it knew of the importance of VIP revenue to its business; and three, it therefore knew or should have known that if the real nature of its marketing activities were revealed, there would be a revenue problem that would be material to Crown's share price,\" Schimmel said.\n'This is information that the company's shareholders should have been told so that they could factor it into the share price and buy their shares on a fully informed basis.\"\nCrown is facing a possible class action.\nCredit:Bloomberg\nMore\n2.58pm on Feb 3, 2017\nThe Aussie dollar has slipped about half a cent from its three-month high of US76.96\u00a2 it hit overnight - but that puts it pretty much smack bang at its long-term average, Westpac's Sean Callow notes:\nThe Aussie is up about 1.5 per cent this week, and 6.3 per cent in 2017, the best performing major currency against the greenback.\nIt's also doing well against other currencies, hitting a 19-month high of 71.28 cents against the euro.\n2.51pm on Feb 3, 2017\nAussie inflation is set to stay low despite the global reflationary trend, UBS economists reckon.\nCore inflation in annual terms looks to have bottomed at around the 1.5 per cent it reached a year ago, the UBS team led by Scott Haslem say.\nHaslem & Co point out that rising oil prices have seen headline CPIs rising strongly across US and Europe, and headline inflation has also drifted higher in Australia. There has also been a recent sharp pick-up in producer prices across China, US and Europe.\nSo wil those global trends spill over on to the local scene? The UBS team argue no. In early 2016 they identified four structural drivers for subdued inflation in Australia:\nHeightened competitive pressure from new entrants;\nNew regulatory resistance to above CPI price rises in many \"public\" services sectors;\nSharply higher housing supply that would slow rents; and\nRecord low wages growth.\nThey estimated these competitive and regulatory pressures, including increased housing supply, were weighing on almost 50 per cent of the CPI basket.\n\"Our analysis suggests that while pass-through from higher world prices is an emerging risk, we argue Australia's structural disinflationary forces not only remain in play, but have intensified,\" they write.\n\"Wage growth has trended lower, competition & regulatory pressures have broadened, while housing rent (& construction) costs have further to slow. Our analysis again raises the risk inflation may stay below the RBA's target band for longer.\"\nThe economists believe Aussie core inflation will underperform the rest of the world and stay below the RBA's 2-3 per cent target until the first half of 2018.\n\"Against forecasts by some for near-term rate cuts and by others for multiple hikes from early-18, we retain an on-hold rates outlook until at least mid-18, targeting a late-18 start to RBA normalisation,\" they write.\n\"For equities, the mix of improving domestic growth, a relatively stable Aussie dollar and ongoing low interest rates, should generally be positive.\"\nANZ economists have also chipped in, saying they believe the recent rise in global headline inflation \"appears to be close to maxing out\" as \"commodity prices have peaked\". They wonder whether investors' \"embrace of reflation\" has been \"premature\".\n\"An analysis of core inflation suggest that there is not much else out there that will add to inflation pressures in the near term,\" they add.\nHave investors prematurely embraced reflation?\nCredit:ANZ\n2.29pm on Feb 3, 2017\nTrump just doesn't get it, writes BusinessDay columnist Michael Pascoe:\n\"America first\" (Donald Trump), \"Australia first\" (Scott Morrison), \"winning in Asia on our terms\" (Bill Shorten) \u2013 populist nationalism is all the rage on the political trade stage.\nAnd the one thing you can be sure about populism is that its goals are short-term and short-sighted, that it is disastrously myopic when faced with the big picture, that it champions the simple and simplistic because it's not capable of anything more.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-03T05:35:04Z", "images": []}

The goal is to trick the email recipient into believing that the message is something they want or need \u2014 a request from their bank, for instance, or a note from someone in their company \u2014 and to click a link or download an attachment.\nWhat really distinguishes phishing is the form the message takes: the attackers masquerade as a trusted entity of some kind, often a real or plausibly real person, or a company the victim might do business with. It's one of the oldest types of cyberattacks, dating back to the 1990s, and it's still one of the most widespread and pernicious, with phishing messages and techniques becoming increasingly sophisticated.\n[ Check out these 11 phishing prevention tips for best technology practices, employee education and social media smarts. | Get the latest from CSO by signing up for our newsletters . ]\n\"Phish\" is pronounced just like it's spelled, which is to say like the word \"fish\" \u2014 the analogy is of an angler throwing a baited hook out there (the phishing email) and hoping you bite. The term arose in the mid-1990s among hackers aiming to trick AOL users into giving up their login information. The \"ph\" is part of a tradition of whimsical hacker spelling, and was probably influenced by the term \"phreaking,\" short for \"phone phreaking,\" an early form of hacking that involved playing sound tones into telephone handsets to get free phone calls.\nSome phishing scams have succeeded well enough to make waves:\nPerhaps one of the most consequential phishing attacks in history happened in 2016, when hackers managed to get Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta to offer up his Gmail password .\nThe \"fappening\" attack, in which intimate photos of a number of celebrities were made public , was originally thought to be a result of insecurity on Apple's iCloud servers, but was in fact the product of a number of successful phishing attempts.\nIn 2016, employees at the University of Kansas responded to a phishing email and handed over access to their paycheck deposit information , resulting in them losing pay.\nWhat is a phishing kit?\nThe availability of phishing kits makes it easy for cyber criminals, even those with minimal technical skills, to launch phishing campaigns. A phishing kit bundles phishing website resources and tools that need only be installed on a server. Once installed, all the attacker needs to do is send out emails to potential victims. Phishing kits as well as mailing lists are available on the dark web . A couple of sites, Phishtank and OpenPhish , keep crowd-sourced lists of known phishing kits.\nThe Duo Labs report, Phish in a Barrel , includes an analysis of phishing kit reuse. Of the 3,200 phishing kits that Duo discovered, 900 (27 percent) were found on more than one host. That number might actually be higher, however. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we see a higher percentage of kit reuse? Perhaps because we were measuring based on the SHA1 hash of the kit contents. A single change to just one file in the kit would appear as two separate kits even when they are otherwise identical,\u201d said Jordan Wright, a senior R&D engineer at Duo and the report\u2019s author.\nDuo Security\nAnalyzing phishing kits allows security teams to track who is using them. \u201cOne of the most useful things we can learn from analyzing phishing kits is where credentials are being sent. By tracking email addresses found in phishing kits, we can correlate actors to specific campaigns and even specific kits,\u201d said Wright in the report. \u201cIt gets even better. Not only can we see where credentials are sent,\u00a0but we also see where credentials claim to be sent from. Creators of phishing kits commonly use the \u2018From\u2019 header like a signing card, letting us find multiple kits created by the same author.\u201d\n[ Prepare to become a Certified Information Security Systems Professional with this comprehensive online course from PluralSight. Now offering a 10-day free trial! ]\nTypes of phishing\nIf there's a common denominator among phishing attacks, it's the disguise. The attackers spoof their email address so it looks like it's coming from someone else, set up fake websites that look like ones the victim trusts, and use foreign character sets to disguise URLs .\nThat said, there are a variety of techniques that fall under the umbrella of phishing. There are a couple of different ways to break attacks down into categories. One is by the purpose of the phishing attempt. Generally, a phishing campaign tries to get the victim to do one of two things:\nHand over sensitive information. These messages aim to trick the user into revealing important data \u2014 often a username and password that the attacker can use to breach a system or account. The classic version of this scam involves sending out an email tailored to look like a message from a major bank; by spamming out the message to millions of people, the attackers ensure that at least some of the recipients will be customers of that bank. The victim clicks on a link in the message and is taken to a malicious site designed to resemble the bank's webpage, and then hopefully enters their username and password. The attacker can now access the victim's account.\nDownload malware. Like a lot of spam, these types of phishing emails aim to get the victim to infect their own computer with malware. Often the messages are \"soft targeted\" \u2014 they might be sent to an HR staffer with an attachment that purports to be a job seeker's resume, for instance. These attachments are often .zip files, or Microsoft Office documents with malicious embedded code. The most common form of malicious code is ransomware \u2014 in 2017 it was estimated that 93 percent of phishing emails contained ransomware attachments .\nThere are also several different ways that phishing emails can be targeted. As we noted, sometimes they aren't targeted at all; emails are sent to millions of potential victims to try to trick them into logging in to fake versions of very popular websites. Vade Secure has tallied the most popular brands that hackers use in their phishing attempts (see infographic below). Other times, attackers might send \"soft targeted\" emails at someone playing a particular role in an organization, even if they don't know anything about them personally.\nVace Secure\nBut some phishing attacks aim to get login information from, or infect the computers of, specific people. Attackers dedicate much more energy to tricking those victims, who have been selected because the potential rewards are quite high.\nSpear phishing\nWhen attackers try to craft a message to appeal to a specific individual, that's called spear phishing. (The image is of a fisherman aiming for one specific fish, rather than just casting a baited hook in the water to see who bites.) Phishers identify their targets (sometimes using information on sites like LinkedIn) and use spoofed addresses to send emails that could plausibly look like they're coming from co-workers. For instance, the spear phisher might target someone in the finance department and pretend to be the victim's manager requesting a large bank transfer on short notice.\nRelated video:\nWhale phishing\nWhale phishing, or whaling, is a form of spear phishing aimed at the very big fish \u2014 CEOs or other high-value targets. Many of these scams target company board members , who are considered particularly vulnerable: they have a great deal of authority within a company, but since they aren't full-time employees, they often use personal email addresses for business-related correspondence, which doesn't have the protections offered by corporate email.\nGathering enough information to trick a really high-value target might take time, but it can have a surprisingly high payoff. In 2008, cybercriminals targeted corporate CEOs with emails that claimed to have FBI subpoenas attached. In fact, they downloaded keyloggers onto the executives' computers \u2014\u00a0and the scammers' success rate was 10%, snagging almost 2,000 victims.\nOther types of phishing include clone phishing, vishing, snowshoeing. This article explains the differences between the various types of phishing attacks .\nHow to prevent phishing\nThe best way to learn to spot phishing emails is to study examples captured in the wild! This webinar from Cyren starts with a look at a real live phishing website, masquerading as a PayPal login, tempting victims hand over their credentials. Check out the first minute or so of the video to see the telltale signs of a phishing website.\nThere also are a number of steps you can take and mindsets you should get into that will keep you from becoming a phishing statistic, including:\nAlways check the spelling of the URLs in email links before you click or enter sensitive information\nWatch out for URL redirects, where you're subtly sent to a different website with identical design\nIf you receive an email from a source you know but it seems suspicious, contact that source with a new email, rather than just hitting reply\nDon't post personal data, like your birthday, vacation plans, or your address or phone number, publicly on social media\nKnowBe4\nThese are the top-clicked phishing messages according to a Q2 2018 report from security awareness training company KnowBe4 .\nIf you work in your company's IT security department, you can implement proactive measures to protect the organization, including:\n\"Sandboxing\" inbound email, checking the safety of each link a user clicks\nInspecting and analyzing web traffic\nPen-testing your organization to find weak spots and use the results to educate employees\nRewarding good behavior, perhaps by showcasing a \"catch of the day\" if someone spots a phishing email\nRelated video:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2019-02-08T08:03:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Beating Apple, Xiaomi and the gang in China", "content": "Feb 4th 2017\n| DONGGUAN\nDONGGUAN, a southerly Chinese city near Hong Kong, is better known for cranking out cheap trinkets than for producing high-end equipment of any kind. And yet, amid the grit and grime is a gleaming low-rise factory producing some 50m smartphones a year for OPPO, a firm started by China\u2019s BBK Electronics but which is now run independently.\nInside, as well as the usual assembly lines and serried workers, the factory has dozens of staff in quality engineering and testing, conducting 130 different tests on OPPO\u2019s phones before they are released to the market. Such zealous pursuit of quality would be expected of factories that produce phones for Apple\u2014the world-class facilities run by Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn in nearby Shenzhen house similar teams. But it is unusual at a firm that makes relatively inexpensive handsets for the local market.\nGet our daily newsletter\nSee more\nOPPO, and its sister firm, Vivo, also a child of BBK, started out in 2004 and 2009 respectively, making cheap and cheerful phones like plenty of other obscure Chinese manufacturers. They probably didn\u2019t even register on Apple\u2019s radar. Xiaomi was the Chinese handset-maker to watch; urban sophisticates, enticed by viral marketing, flocked to its slick devices. But in June 2016 OPPO\u2019s R9, which costs around $400, overtook the iPhone, which is priced at twice that, as China\u2019s best-selling handset. Vivo, which targets younger consumers with lower prices, is also surging.\nThe two brands\u2019 achievements are remarkable. Two years ago they were struggling to join China\u2019s top five smartphone-makers; now they are among the biggest five globally. One out of every three smartphones sold in China in the third quarter of 2016 carried one of their brands; in 2012 their combined share was below 3%.\nThat should give Apple pause. Tim Cook, its boss, predicted in 2013 that China would become his firm\u2019s biggest market. But iPhone sales there have stagnated (see chart). In the third quarter its market share fell to 7.1%, down from 11.4% a year earlier.\nXiaomi has even more reason to fret. About six years ago it bet on an \u201casset-light\u201d strategy, meaning it relied almost entirely on selling its phones online. This worked brilliantly when the overall market for smartphones was growing, and the richest cities, with the largest number of tech-aware consumers, were booming. Xiaomi was once valued at some $46bn, but its fortunes in China have plunged.\nThat is chiefly due to the fact that growth has shifted sharply to the rising middle classes in smaller cities. Consumers there are less experienced with smartphones than their fancier cousins in Beijing and Shanghai, and are wary of buying them online. They want to touch and compare handsets. OPPO and Vivo spotted this difference early. OPPO in particular shot to the top because it invested heavily in bricks-and-mortar retail distribution in lower-tier cities. Today the firm\u2019s phones are sold at some 200,000 retail outlets across the mainland, which gives its salesmen the chance to coddle customers and nudge them to buy pricier phones.\nAt first, OPPO\u2019s strategy was masterminded by Duan Yongping, founder of BBK, who began by selling basic electronics. He is known in China as \u201cDuanfett\u201d, a play on Warren Buffett, because of his financial acumen and also his admiration for Mr Buffett (he paid over $600,000 at an auction to have lunch with him in 2007). Mr Duan has since retired, but still influences the firms\u2019 cultures.\nIt took discipline not to be waylaid by the striking (though short-lived) success of Xiaomi\u2019s hype-fuelled internet strategy. Many other companies tried to copy it. From 2011 to 2013, insiders say, OPPO looked hard at expanding its online sales channels, but decided against it. Sky Li, managing director of OPPO\u2019s international mobile business, says the reason lies in his firm\u2019s long-held adherence to the philosophy of ben fen\u2014loosely translated, sticking to one\u2019s knitting.\nInstead, OPPO became still more expert at incentivising its physical retailers. It has shown itself willing to share some of its profits with local stores. It uses a sophisticated system of subsidies that vary by model and season. One retailer in a small town in Sichuan says that although he sells many brands of smartphones, OPPO\u2019s generous subsidies make him extra-eager to peddle its wares.\nThat has its costs, of course: OPPO does not disclose the size of its total subsidies nor its profit margin, which may be low compared with other smartphone makers. Fat profits are hard to come by in China\u2019s giant smartphone market. Because it is simple for firms to outsource almost every aspect of phonemaking, from designing components and chipsets to contract manufacturing, the barrier to entry is low (the physical networks that OPPO and Vivo have built will be far harder to replicate than an online presence). Teeming firms means vicious price competition, especially for cheaper phones. The price of a Chinese smartphone may drop to as little as $50, analysts reckon.\nPressures at home explain why Chinese firms are also looking abroad. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Xiaomi and Vivo were vying with each other behind Samsung in the race for second place in India\u2019s smartphone market. Huawei, a local telecoms-equipment giant that ranks third in the domestic market, already makes two-fifths of its sales outside China; Shao Yang of its consumer-business group says this share will rise to three-fifths within five years. OPPO is already a force in India, and is in second place in South-East Asia behind Samsung. It has opened a new marketing centre in Cairo to spearhead expansion in Africa and the Middle East.\nKevin Wang of IHS Markit, a research firm, nonetheless reckons that a round of consolidation must be on its way. Within five years, he reckons, most of the 50 or so local Chinese phone manufacturers will be gone. If OPPO and Vivo can stay at the summit, that would be nearly as surprising as the dizzying speed of their ascent.\nThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \"Upstarts on top\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-04T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

It was encouraging to see LG stepping in to fill a gap, but then a few days back a strange problem reared its ugly head: the monitors stopped functioning correctly when they were placed too close to a router.\nMore specifically, the displays would flicker or freeze when they were within two meters of a wireless router. That\u2019s a big problem to have, especially when those UltraFine 5K monitors run $1,299 each. At first, LG only told consumers to put their wireless router more than two meters away from their monitor, which was a disappointing solution to the issue.\nNow, however, LG seems to have a better plan in place. According to Recode, LG will begin including additional shielding in all 27-inch UltraFine 5K monitors manufactured after February 2017. This extra shielding will ensure that the monitor can be used issue-free, regardless of your router\u2019s proximity.\nREAD MORE: LG 5K Display eyes-on\nJust as well, LG also told Recode that UltraFine monitors which are currently out in the wild can be retrofitted with that extra shielding. This means that the monitor you paid more than $1,000 for doesn\u2019t have to remain a dud forever, but unfortunately, LG didn\u2019t detail the process for getting that shielding added.\nLG will likely reveal how it plans to outfit existing monitors with this extra shielding shortly. We\u2019ll keep an ear to the ground for more information, but in the meantime, head down to the comments section and let us know if you\u2019ve experienced any of these monitor woes.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-03T15:08:01Z", "images": []}

But it didn\u2019t list any traditional media companies like Fox or Viacom.\nThat\u2019s odd, because Los Angeles-based Snap is, fundamentally, a burgeoning media company. Snapchat may be a messaging app, but in many ways, it\u2019s also a new kind of television.\n...\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company , Inc.

{"title": "Snap's plan is most unfriendly to outsiders", "content": "Play video\nSnap admits that this is unprecedented, acknowledging, \"We are not aware of any other company that has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a US stock exchange.\"\nIt is different from its predecessors, Facebook and Google, which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share.\nAdvertisement\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die.\nCredit:Carl Court\nIn recent years, Facebook and Google have revised this structure to add a non-voting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn't sway the results.\nSnap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go.\nAnd this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.\nHow the structure works\nFor gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this non-voting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.\nThe fact that 26-year-old Spiegel, pictured with fiance Miranda Kerr, is getting total control of a new company with uncertain prospects but real growth is perhaps cause for alarm.\nCredit:AP\nSnap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.\nClass B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.\nMark Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook non-voting stock.\nCredit:AP\nThen there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.\nThe two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn't cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock.\nEric Schmidt at Google has talked up Evan Spiegel as a visionary.\nCredit:AP\nSnap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Spiegel that will be 3 per cent of the company's post-IPO value.\nThis award will be paid out in equal quarterly instalments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Murphy will simply be a close second.\nThe fact that 26-year-old Spiegel is getting total control of a new company with uncertain prospects but real growth is perhaps cause for alarm. Who knows what will happen years from now?\nSnap, which looks a lot like Twitter did at its IPO stage, could also experience bumps in the road as Twitter did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.\nFacebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. Twitter has struggled with just one product - the platform on which people the world over, including the US President, send 140-character messages called tweets.\nWhether Spiegel can expand beyond Snap's disappearing photos and texts is unknown, though the media machine will certainly turn up the hype, trumpeting claims that he is the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.\nIndeed, a recent New York Times article on Spiegel described him being \"mature\", a listener and someone Eric Schmidt at Google was talking up as a visionary. This may or may not be pablum, but one has to wonder why it justifies this type of stock given the risks.\nIf things are going well, no one is going to question Spiegel and Murphy's control.\nBut if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action.\nIndeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity - but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Spiegel is so young?\nI suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme.\nFirst, in October, Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Spiegel and Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.\nSecond, the founders' control goes away only if they die or when they hold only 30 per cent of the Class C shares they held at the time of the IPO.\nThis means Spiegel or Murphy could sell 69 per cent of his Class C shares and all of his Class A and B shares and still control the company. And then, they could reload with a second dividend of Class A shares on all of the Class C shares.\nSo, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.\nHypothetical scenario 1\nSpiegel dies. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the \"disappearing pictures\" concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on \"internet radio\" before selling broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for billions of dollars.)\nHypothetical scenario 2\nAt age 30, Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he's engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job, but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.\nHypothetical scenario 3\nSpiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.\nPotential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks?\nI'd note here that Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook non-voting stock.\nDoes Spiegel deserve better than that? And remember the other tech titans, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, all have one share, one vote.\nIn its prospectus, Snap says its team is \"kind, smart and creative\", which is kind of like Whitney Houston singing \"I believe that children are the future\".\nAnd there's a lot of other stuff about growth and big ideas. Snap may be right, and Evan Spiegel truly is the second coming, but this just does not justify the extreme governance given the risk. Instead, it just seems silly, but not in the fun Snapchat sort of way.\nLoading\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-04T01:29:06Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Silicon Valley\u2019s criticism of Donald Trump", "content": "Print edition | Business\nFeb 4th 2017\nEARLY in 2016 Schumpeter went to a dinner with one of Silicon Valley\u2019s luminaries, a man of towering intelligence and negligible humility. Asked about the upcoming election, he scoffed: it didn\u2019t matter who America\u2019s president was. Politics had become irrelevant, he said. Technology firms, and their leaders, would carry on fashioning brilliant products and generally carrying out God\u2019s work on Earth, regardless of who occupied the White House. Cue smirks and more Hawaiian Kampachi all round.\nNow Silicon Valley has thrust itself into a presidential stink. Technology groups were the first among big firms to slam Donald Trump\u2019s executive order of January 27th, which temporarily bans people from seven mainly-Muslim countries in the Middle East from entering America. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s boss, criticised it to employees. Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, told staff he was \u201cupset\u201d on the day of the order, and a day later the firm\u2019s co-founder, Sergey Brin, was spotted among hundreds of protesters at San Francisco airport.\nGet our daily newsletter\nSee more\nJust a month earlier all these technology firms and more had paid tribute at Trump Tower, their leaders laughing for the cameras while Mr Trump promised: \u201cI\u2019m here to help you folks.\u201d The honeymoon has now abruptly ended because immigrants are so important to the technology industry. But the sector\u2019s liberal tendencies\u2014it has few of the instinctive Republicans who populate most boardrooms\u2014also play a part.\nAttracting hyper-brainy people from around the world is at the heart of the tech business model. Mr Brin was born in Moscow, Mr Pichai in Tamil Nadu and Satya Nadella, the head of Microsoft, in Hyderabad. The biological father of the late Steve Jobs was a Syrian who moved to America, a journey that as of this week would be impossible. Half of all the American startups that are worth more than $1bn were founded by migrants. Many of the engineers at tech firms were born abroad, too. In Cupertino, a posh suburb in Silicon Valley, half the population is foreign-born.\nThe industry has long supported immigration, therefore. But taking a vocal stand on political subjects has not been its habit, and by entering the fray it will draw attention to its own hypocrisies. For decades tech bosses have pushed a convenient doublespeak to explain their firms\u2019 rise. Their dazzling products are the creations of their leaders. The resulting fortunes are these visionaries\u2019 just reward. But the economic and social consequences of the industry\u2019s output, not all of them good, are no one\u2019s responsibility. Instead, the industry argues, they are the result of unavoidable shifts in technology, in turn responding to society\u2019s broad demands. This logic has allowed tech firms to avoid responsibility for the stolen or bilious content that they publish and for the jobs that their algorithms help eliminate\u2014to say nothing of their own oligopolistic market shares. Silicon Valley boasts of its own might and shrugs at its own impotence both at once.\nThe election campaign underlined that this trick is by now exhausted. It is obvious to all that technology firms are political beasts. Politicians rely on Twitter and Facebook messages, social-media advertising and data mining. Tech platforms are used to disseminate fake news. And tech firms are prominent actors in the economic debate that drives populism. The job losses in manufacturing that infuriate Americans have resulted far more from decades of technological advance than from globalisation. The piles of uninvested cash stashed unpatriotically abroad, which Mr Trump now wants to bring home, belong chiefly to technology firms. The low share of American profits that is reinvested partly reflects the heft of Silicon Valley. For every dollar of cash the tech industry makes, it reinvests 24 cents; that compares with 50 cents for other non-financial firms. Growing inequality is partly the result of its concentrated ownership, with a small group of individuals taking a big share of a giant stream of profits.\nIn the weeks since November 8th, the technology industry has started to come clean. Google and Facebook have announced measures to try to tackle fake news. In January Mr Zuckerberg said he would travel to 30 American states this year to meet ordinary Americans and hear how globalisation and technology have affected them. Mr Nadella is talking publicly about the effects of artificial intelligence on employment. Others have chosen to make their mark by helping the new government. Elon Musk, the head of Tesla, an electric-car firm, and Travis Kalanick, of Uber, have both become advisers to the president (this week they promised to confront him about his stance on immigration).\nSwipe for the next ethical dilemma\nComing out of the closet as among the most important actors in American society boosts technology bosses. So does standing up for their beliefs in things like immigration. It is more intellectually honest. It goes down well with employees. And it is probably popular with customers, too. Most consumer-facing technology firms have user bases that are skewed towards the young and non-Americans, both groups that dislike Mr Trump. After taxis went on strike at JFK airport in New York in protest against the travel ban, Uber came under fire for not boycotting the airport, too, and the hashtag \u201c#DeleteUber\u201d went viral.\nYet tech firms still have an awfully long way to go. Often they define virtue as what they judge to be in their business interests. Last year, Mr Cook dismissed a demand by the European Union to pay more tax as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d. In December Apple agreed to a state request to ban the\u00a0New York Times\u2019s app in China, where the firm makes just over a fifth of its sales. Mr Zuckerberg fits the same pattern: he says he wants to give away 99% of his fortune and that he believes in the ideal of free expression, but his firm paid a tax rate of just 6% over the past half-decade, and he has toadied up to China\u2019s censors, too. Oligopolistic, hubristic and ruthless to its core, Silicon Valley is no beacon of moral leadership.\nThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \"Silicon Valiant\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-04T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Oppo topped China\u2019s smartphone market in 2016, as Apple recorded first annual decline", "content": "Jon Russell @jonrussell / 2 years\nOppo is\u00a0not a name\u00a0that is anything like as familiar as Apple, Xiaomi or Huawei worldwide, but there\u2019s further proof that it is most definitely one\u00a0to watch, according the findings of a new report.\nThat\u2019s because the little-known phone-maker\u00a0scooped the top spot for smartphone sales in China last year, for the first time, fractionally beating out its sister company Vivo and heavyweight Huawei.\u00a0Apple and Xiaomi, two massive names, meanwhile, posted their first annual shipment declines, highlighting the different struggles that both companies face in The Middle Kingdom.\nOppo and Vivo are both owned by Guangzhou-based company\u00a0BBK, and they have steadily developed a strong presence in China, and markets like India and Southeast Asia . That\u2019s through well designed phones that adopt new technology, like AMOLED screens, but are priced well below the iPhone.\u00a0Most importantly, they\u00a0use aggressive\u00a0advertising campaigns and offline sales channels to reach prospective customers. All in all, the approach is similar\u00a0to the tactics that have worked for Samsung.\nA new report from IDC found that this strategy propelled Oppo\u2019s annual sales in China to 78.4 million, up 122 percent year-on-year,\u00a0first on the list, while Vivo sat slightly lower in third with 69.2 million shipments, up 97 percent. Sandwiched between the two is Huawei, with 76.6 million shipments. Apple and Xiaomi round out the top five.\nAccording to IDC, Oppo and Vivo combined account for nearly\u00a0one-third of the Chinese smartphone market, which is the world\u2019s largest based on sales. That\u2019s quite a staggering feat considering the competition \u2014 Samsung and Lenovo are among the many that didn\u2019t make it into\u00a0IDC\u2019s tracker.\nIt was widely assumed that Xiaomi didn\u2019t have a great 2016. The company declined to reveal annual sales figures for the first time, and its CEO acknowledged it had grown too quickly with\u00a0expectations too\u00a0lofty. IDC estimates its annual sales in China, which accounts for the bulk of its business, were down by nearly 10 percent. That suggests that Xiaomi\u2019s 2016 total was well short of the 70 million-plus sales it carded in 2015.\nBut Xiaomi is looking to push itself forward in different ways now.\u00a0CEO Lei Jun said last month that it\u00a0will focus on expanding its retail footprint \u2014 perhaps inspired by the success of Vivo and Oppo \u2014 and IDC sees much merit there.\n\u201cThere is no longer a single channel that is seeing exponential growth for smartphones unlike previous years. Most brands are now using a combination of channels to increase their shipments,\u201d it added.\nAs for Apple, we know from its recent earnings that the company had another underwhelming quarter in China.\u00a0iPhone sales declined 12 percent year-on-year during the period, in stark contrast to\u00a0record sales numbers\u00a0elsewhere in the world.\nDespite\u00a0its first annual decline in sales in China, according to IDC\u2019s numbers, the analyst firm is positive about Apple\u2019s position in the country. In its analysis, it argued that mid- and low-end smartphone firms like Oppo and Vivo haven\u2019t stolen its marketshare, but instead existing Apple owners are waiting for a phone that is\u00a0truly worth paying to upgrade.\n\u201cMost Apple users are expected to be holding out for the new iPhone that will be launched this year, and that will help the brand to see a growth in 2017,\u201d IDC said. \u201cApple\u2019s 10-year anniversary iPhone will also likely attract some of the high-end Android users in China to convert to an iPhone.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-05T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Underneath this, they fear the economy is already overheating.\nAs a result, they expect inflation to pick up sharply this year, forcing more rapid interest rate hikes.\nThat could cause a recession next year, they say. In their models, the signals are that this could take place in mid-2018.\nGoogle's co-founder Sergey Brin joined hundreds protesting at San Francisco airport. \"I'm here because I'm a refugee,\" he told a reporter.\n\"Inflation is picking up and that is the game-changer because it brings the Fed into play,\" said Mr Carrick.\n\"That means we could get an increase in bad loans, which could cause the economy to head into reverse.\"\nReed Hastings, the founder of Netflix, said \"Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all\".\nCredit:David Paul Morris\nHis study of data going back to 1967 shows that every recession came after banks tightened credit conditions.\n\"We did have a big loosening of credit conditions in recent years, and now we are moving to neutral,\" he said.\nOn his historical data, \"two to three years before every recession you had a big loosening of policy, about a year before the recession you've turned neutral, and then you see a tightening,\" Mr Carrick said.\n\"I've been very cheeky, saying we are five quarters before the next recession. It is cheeky, but every recession in the US has been caused by a tightening of credit conditions.\"\nMr Carrick added that rising rates will also strip the economy and financial markets of one source of insulation from unexpected political events, which has encouraged stability in recent years.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-06T06:48:13Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple, Google, Facebook and more file amicus brief opposing Trump\u2019s immigration ban", "content": "Reddit\nA total of 97\u00a0companies, including Apple and many other major Silicon Valley technology firms, filed an amicus brief late on Sunday to oppose the immigration order introduced by US President Donald\u00a0Trump ( via Bloomberg ). An amicus brief is a legal filing\u00a0that allows parties not directly involved in a lawsuit to offer their opinions to the court.\nThe brief says an\u00a0open-ended ban does not aid\u00a0America\u2019s national security and instead undermines its interests.\u00a0It notes that 200 of the companies in the Fortune 500 list\u00a0were founded by immigrants or their children.\nTry Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial\nThe brief\u00a0signatories include Apple, Facebook,\u00a0Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter and Uber.\u00a0Amazon is not listed but this is because Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, is already backing the original lawsuit.\u00a0The amicus brief legally\u00a0supports the cases filed in Washington and Minnesota.\nHere\u2019s an extract of the comments in the brief, which was apparently originally planned to be filed later in the week, which note that the need to protect national security is not justified by a blanket ban on immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\u201cImmigrants make many of the Nation\u2019s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country\u2019s most innovative and iconic companies,\u201d the brief states. \u201cAmerica has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants\u2014through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.\u201d\nAs it stands, the order remains halted after a US district judge temporarily stayed the ban. An appeals court\u00a0ruling in opposition\u00a0means\u00a0that\u00a0the executive order has not been reinstated.\nIn a memo to employees, Tim Cook has previously said that the order is \u2018not a policy we support\u2019. As well as attacking the\u00a0purpose of the ban, the brief also criticizes the slapdash way in which it was enacted causing confusion and even more disruption.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-06T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

So he's started one of the first hedge funds run completely by artificial intelligence.\n\"Humans have bias and sensitivities, conscious and unconscious,\" says Hodjat, a computer scientist who helped lay\u00a0the groundwork for Apple's Siri. \"It's well documented we humans make mistakes. For me, it's scarier to be relying on those human-based intuitions and justifications than relying on purely what the data and statistics are telling you.\"\nBabak Hodjat\nPhotographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\nHodjat, with 21 patents to his name, is co-founder and top scientist of Sentient Technologies Inc., a startup that has spent nearly a decade\u2014largely in secret\u2014training an AI system that can scour billions of pieces of data, spot trends, adapt as it learns and make money trading stocks. The team of technology-industry vets is betting that software\u00a0responsible for\u00a0teaching computers to drive cars, beat the world's best poker players and translate languages will give their hedge fund an edge on Wall Street pros.\nThe walls of Sentient's San Francisco office are dotted with posters for robots-come-alive movies such as \"Terminator.\" Inside a small windowless trading room, the only light emanates from\u00a0computer screens and a virtual fire on a big-screen TV. Two guys are quietly monitoring the machine's trades\u2014just in case the system needs to be shut down.\n\u201cIf all hell breaks loose,\" Hodjat says, \"there is a red button.\"\nSentient won't disclose its performance or many details about the technology, and the jury is out on the wisdom of handing off trading to a machine. While traditional hedge funds including Bridgewater Associates, Point72 and Renaissance Technologies have poured money into advanced technology, many use artificial intelligence to generate ideas\u2014not to control their entire trading operations.\nAll the same, Sentient, which currently trades only its own money, is being closely watched by the finance and AI\u00a0communities. The venture capital firm owned by Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, and India's biggest conglomerate, Tata Group, are among backers who have given the company $143 million. (Beyond trading, Sentient's AI system is being applied to a separate e-commerce product.)\nTrading is \"one of the top 10 places that AI can make a difference,\" says Nello Cristianini, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Bristol who has been advising Sentient. \"A trading algorithm can look at the data, make a decision, act and repeat\u2014you can have full autonomy.\"\nSentient's team includes veterans of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other technology companies.\u00a0 They're part of a small group in Silicon Valley using expertise in data science and the field of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to try and disrupt financial markets.\nAI scientists typically have no interest in working for a hedge fund, says Richard Craib, who started the AI hedge fund Numerai. \"But they may want to mess around with data sets.\" Numerai's system makes trades by aggregating trading algorithms submitted by anonymous contributors who participate in a weekly tournament where prizes are awarded in Bitcoin. It recently raised $6 million from investors including Howard Morgan, the co-founder of the quant investment management firm Renaissance Technologies. \"It's entirely a data science problem,\" Craib says. \u00a0\nAnother company, called Emma, started a hedge fund last year based on an artificial intelligence system that can write news articles.\u00a0\nEmployees of Sentient Technologies in San Francisco.\nPhotographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\nHodjat of Sentient spent much of his career focused on the language-detection technology behind smartphone digital assistants. Several employees from his previous company, Dejima, went on to create Apple's Siri. Rather than join, he chose to focus on advances in artificial intelligence. His career goals didn't include finance, but he sees markets as one of the most promising applications for the technology. The vast amounts of publicly available data, along with stronger computers to analyse it for patterns, make the field an ideal fit. \"That is the fuel for AI,\" he says.\u00a0\nSentient's system is inspired by evolution. According to patents, Sentient has thousands of machines running simultaneously around the world, algorithmically creating what are essentially trillions of virtual traders that it calls \"genes.\" These genes are tested by giving them hypothetical sums of money to trade in simulated situations created from historical data. The genes that are unsuccessful die off, while those that make money are spliced together with others to create the next generation. Thanks to increases in computing power, Sentient can squeeze 1,800 simulated trading days into a few minutes.\nAn acceptable trading gene takes a few days and then is used in\u00a0live trading. Employees set goals such as returns to achieve, risk level and time horizon, and then let the machines go to work. The AI system evolves autonomously as it gains more experiences.\nSentient typically owns a wide-ranging batch of U.S. stocks, trading hundreds of times per day and holding positions for days or weeks. \"We didn't impose that on the system,\" says Jeff Holman, the company's chief investment officer. \"The artificial intelligence seems to agree with what you get from human intelligence that it's better to spread your bets and have a more diversified portfolio.\"\u00a0\nAs impressive as Sentient's technology appears, it's hard to know if it works. The company says the AI system is beating internal benchmarks, but won't disclose what those are. It shares little about the data used for the AI's decision-making\u00a0and isn't profitable. The company plans to bring in outside investors later this year. Holman, a Wall Street veteran who joined last year, said the\u00a0company is limited on what it can say by U.S. Securities Exchange Commission rules restricting marketing by hedge funds that are raising money. \"The platform is solid,\" he says. \"It doesn't look like any other strategy I've seen.\"\u00a0\nAnthony Ledford, the chief scientist at the $19 billion hedge fund Man AHL in London, warns of putting too much faith in this branch of artificial intelligence without more evidence. Man AHL uses machine learning for a portion of its clients money, and Ledford is encouraged by the results. While the company is exploring a standalone machine-learning strategy, he says it's too early to declare success.\u00a0\"There's a lot of hype and promise,\" Ledford says. \"But when you actually ask people how many hundreds of millions dollars they are trading, many of them don't come back with much at all.\"\nLittle performance data is available about AI-focused hedge funds. One index that tracks 12 pools that utilize AI as part of its core strategies, called Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, returned 5 percent last year. That's slightly better than the average hedge fund, but trailed the S&P 500.\nTristan Fletcher, who wrote his doctoral thesis on machine learning in financial markets and works for a hedge fund, says investors may be reluctant to turn over their money completely to a machine. \"I know how conservative investors are and I know of no one who would put their money in a\u00a0system that's fully systematic,\" says Fletcher. \"Machine learning isn't a panacea for everything. You need people who have literal thinking.\"\nChen Chen worked for Sentient until 2012 as an analyst. In August 2011, while the company was still known as Genetic Finance and operating in secret, the system was trading when Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating for the first time, sending markets into turmoil. Chen, now a trader in Hong Kong, went back to review the system's performance for the day and saw it had outperformed the market and made money. He notes that there was no precedent for a U.S. downgrade and wonders how Sentient's AI system made its decisions. \u00a0\"That was a big surprise,\" he says.\u00a0\n\u2014with Nishant Kumar in London\nPublished on\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-06T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Shaw\u2019s bid to win back the\u00a0West", "content": "The Globe and Mail\nA\n+6\nThe subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.\nTo view your reading history, you must be logged in.\nShaw's bid to win back the\u00a0West\nThe company's strategy is focused on the long game, but is it doing enough now?\nBrad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications Inc., at the company\u2019s Calgary headquarters in November,\u00a02016.\nChris Bolin/The Globe and Mail\nComments\nIt was $100-million Brad Shaw didn't want to\u00a0take.\nThe chief executive officer of Shaw Communications Inc. was in Halifax in June, 2015, when he got the call from Guy Laurence, then the CEO of Rogers Communications\u00a0Inc.\n\"He said, 'Oh, great thing, we've got this all figured out, we're going to buy the spectrum from you,'\" Mr. Shaw says, punctuating his story with a characteristic boisterous laugh during a rare interview at the company's Calgary\u00a0headquarters.\nStory continues below advertisement\nIt should have been good news. A deal he had sealed more than two years earlier to sell wireless airwaves to the Toronto-based telecom giant was finally complete and Rogers was ready to pay the balance after a deposit of $250-million. But the Shaw CEO wasn't\u00a0happy.\n\"We were a little\u00a0disappointed.\"\nThe problem was a change of heart. In the years since Mr. Shaw struck the Rogers deal, he and his management team had shifted their view on the wireless business. And it wasn't the first time. The company had made stabs at a mobile strategy before \u2013 at least three times over the span of two decades \u2013 but had always remained on the sidelines as Rogers, BCE Inc. and Telus Corp. built cross-country networks and attracted millions of subscribers. By 2015, after years of wavering, Shaw wanted in. Now, it had no\u00a0spectrum.\nThe spectrum sale netted a profit of $158-million but that was cold comfort. It represented yet another chapter in a string of strategic missteps \u2013 and not just on the wireless front. An ill-timed investment in media in 2010 saw the company pour $2-billion into a set of broadcasting assets just as advertising revenues began to\u00a0plummet.\nMeanwhile, Shaw's core cable-television business, the heart of a family company with more than 40 years of history, was bleeding customers as Western rival Telus Corp. moved into the TV market and more people cut the cord in favour of online streaming services. Revenue growth at Shaw's cable division, which used to post healthy double-digit increases on an annual basis, had flat\u00a0lined.\nIt was time for change \u2013 or, as Mr. Shaw likes to call it, \"the\u00a0pivot.\"\nThe company launched a broad shakeup in 2014 that saw it reorganize into separate consumer- and business-focused divisions plus a dedicated technology and network team. The same year, it used extra room on its balance sheet to buy ViaWest, a U.S. data-management business that has shown promising results and helped Shaw set up a similar operations in\u00a0Canada.\nStory continues below advertisement\nBut its big bet came in December, 2015, when it sealed a deal for wireless upstart Wind Mobile. It paid $1.6-billion for Wind, which \u2013 beset by legal issues, uncertain ownership and all but starved of capital \u2013 had staggered along long enough to attract close to one million subscribers. Shaw funded its wireless investment a month later when it announced the sale of its media assets to Corus Entertainment Inc. (conveniently also controlled by the Shaw family) for\u00a0$2.65-billion.\nBy last fall, as Shaw was preparing to relaunch Wind as Freedom Mobile, Mr. Shaw was convinced his company had reached a turning point. During an hour-long interview with The Globe and Mail, he swings from blunt assessments of past struggles to wide-eyed excitement for the path\u00a0ahead.\n\"Oh, I'm pumped,\" he says, leaning forward on a sofa and accentuating points with his hands. \"We're well thought out, we have a lot of choices. And we've never had this at any time in our company, and to have it now, with everything changing so much? It's\u00a0powerful.\"\nHis management team's priorities are clear: win back some of the cable TV business; sell more Internet; and, critically, use new-found Freedom Mobile to round out a roster of connectivity services. In short, sell the bundle. Win back the West. \"We want to make customers' lives simpler. We want them to be on our network 100 per cent of the\u00a0time.\"\nIt's an ambitious goal. And enemy No. 1 is Vancouver-based\u00a0Telus.\n\"It is about execution for us now \u2013 we pivoted, we got all the assets. Now, it's this team against Darren's team,\" Mr. Shaw says, referencing Telus's famously intense CEO Darren Entwistle. \"So how well are we going to be able to do\u00a0that?\"\nStory continues below advertisement\nIt won't be easy. \"This renewed Shaw growth story will not be without its challenges, including execution, managing heavy wireless capex requirements and facing a very strong wireline competitor in Telus in Western Canada,\" RBC Dominion Securities Inc. analyst Drew McReynolds\u00a0says.\nFreedom Mobile is in the midst of a generational network upgrade, but even when that's done, only a limited number of devices will work on its new network. Until their network service improves, companies such as Apple and Samsung will not allow Freedom to sell their premium phone products. The carrier also needs more spectrum to help it improve service in office buildings and parking garages and likely won't be able secure any in the near\u00a0future.\nShaw's strategy for Freedom is focused on the long game, but even as it takes distant aim at the market controlled by the Big Three, there are questions about whether it could be doing more sooner. It committed to spend $250-million on Freedom's LTE network roll-out between 2016 and the end of this fiscal year in August, which compared with it competitors, is \"considerably lower than what we have seen in the past,\" Canaccord Genuity's Aravinda Galappatthige\u00a0says.\nSome say the company should double down on wireless right away, by selling non-core assets to devote more resources \u2013 and management attention \u2013 to the mobile strategy. But Shaw executives insist they're comfortable with their current plan for capital spending, which will see the company commit about 60 per cent of its $1.3-billion envelope for 2017 to a number of \"growth initiatives,\" including wireless, its new TV platform, BlueSky TV, and upgrades to its cable\u00a0network.\nWhile Mr. Shaw looks forward to going on the offensive after playing defence against Telus for years, Mr. Entwistle isn't likely to stand\u00a0down.\n\"Telus has a very strong management team,\" Scotia Capital Inc. analyst Jeff Fan says. \"And I don't think they're going to sit back and let Shaw run the table.\"\nOutside Shaw headquarters in\u00a0Calgary.\nJeff McIntosh/CP\n'We got\u00a0pounded'\nIn July of 2012, an electrical fire ripped through a transformer room at Shaw's Calgary headquarters, triggering the sprinkler system and knocking out the building's power. Radio stations went off the air, communications outages wreaked havoc on key services across the city \u2013 and almost 600 Shaw employees were later displaced due to water damage in the\u00a0building.\nA \"complete renovation and restoration\" was added to a major corporate overhaul \u2013 a program known internally as \"Focus to Deliver\" \u2013 that was about to get under way, prompted by the painful recognition that the company was floundering on several fronts and needed to beat a bold new\u00a0path.\nWhen executives and managers returned to the office in December, 2014, they found both an altered corporate structure and a vastly improved workplace. Shaw Court is an airy space, flooded with natural light and its walls are adorned with art, a Canadian-focused collection curated by company founder and current executive chairman, JR\u00a0Shaw.\nWhen asked about his artistic choices during a chance encounter at a quiet restaurant in Calgary, the Shaw patriarch lights up. The art's placement and symbolism are important, he explains. In the hallway outside his CEO son's office, for example, a painting of a campfire urges employees to have \"fire in their bellies,\" he says, and a piece entitled Road to the Future tells them to focus on what's\u00a0ahead.\nWhen JR signed up his first cable customer just outside of Edmonton in 1971, he could not have foreseen the struggles his company would one day face as it seeks to make the transition from the cable-TV operator he built to an Internet and wireless-data\u00a0company.\nJR started small, but Shaw was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange by 1983 and became Canada's fourth-biggest cable company by 1985. In the 1990s, Shaw borrowed heavily to invest in cable acquisitions along with network build-outs and upgrades to offer high-speed Internet. JR's eldest son, Jim, took over as CEO in 1998 and saw his father's debt binge pay off as Shaw had little trouble snapping up new digital television and Internet subscribers over the next decade. It even cracked into home-telephone service, using voice-over Internet protocol technology, eating into Telus's traditional\u00a0market.\nThe company's market value grew, too: from $189-million in 1990 to $2.2-billion in 1998 and $9.5-billion in 2010, when Brad took over from his brother. But the landscape was about to shift\u00a0dramatically.\nRight away, Mr. Shaw faced a major test as the company's core cable-TV business was under\u00a0attack.\nTelus, once a rival only in telephone and Internet, was coming on strong with Optik TV: a new Internet protocol television (IPTV) offering that enticed customers with interactive features and advanced PVR functions. And customers were buying in. By 2015, Telus's TV business cracked the million-subscriber\u00a0mark.\n\"You kind of thought, 'Oh, no, we'll be able to compete.' But we found out [Telus] came in with a good product at the right price point, and really took it to us,\" Mr. Shaw\u00a0says.\nShaw failed to counter. Faced with competition from the likes of Optik TV and Internet streaming options that led some to cut the cord completely, the company has lost more than 600,000 cable subscribers since\u00a02011.\n\"We were a little blind in how we were managing the business,\" Mr. Shaw says. \"You always want to do a good job. You don't want to come in as CEO and get pounded. And we got\u00a0pounded.\"\nAt the same time, the stable of broadcast-media assets \u2013 which Shaw acquired in 2010 for $2-billion out of the CanWest Global Communications Corp. restructuring \u2013 was deteriorating as advertising dollars\u00a0disappeared.\nBy 2014, Mr. Shaw and his management team \u2013 a group he had either recruited or promoted since stepping into his brother's shoes \u2013 knew it was time for radical\u00a0change.\n\"It's almost like you have to go back three years to 'Focus to Deliver,'\" chief marketing and culture officer Jim Little says during a roundtable interview with a handful of top Shaw executives, referencing the changes launched in 2014. \"That was the beginning of the pivot as far as we were conscious of\u00a0it.\"\nShaw president Jay Mehr adds the company was struggling to respond to the TV threat posed by Telus. \"There was an awareness that the game we were playing was not a winnable game. That the stuff that had made us successful for the previous 10 years was not going to make us successful for the next 10\u00a0years.\"\nThey combined all of Shaw's residential-service businesses \u2013 cable, satellite, Internet and home phone \u2013 into one consumer division, created a separate enterprise unit for any services sold to business clients and merged engineering and IT departments into one technology and network\u00a0team.\nShaw shed 400 jobs in the process and cut even more when it consolidated its customer-service call centres into fewer cities, a move that affected 1,600 employees. In its 2014 and 2015 fiscal years, restructuring costs amounted to\u00a0$110-million.\nStill, there was the question of a strategy on wireless. In the 1990s, Shaw invested about $30-million for a 10-per-cent stake in Microcell Telecommunications Inc., which operated as Fido and was sold to Rogers in 2004. But Shaw dumped its investment in 1998. In the 2000s, Shaw management mused about offering cellphone service through a partnership with one of the Big Three, but the company never actually struck an agreement with\u00a0one.\nThen, with an eye toward building its own wireless network from scratch, it paid $189-million for spectrum licences during a 2008 public auction. The effort was on-again-off-again from the start.

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg)\nTwitter knows it has a problem with online abuse, and on Tuesday it announced three more changes it's making to help users deal with it.\nThe social network said in a blog post that it's cracking down even more on repeat abusers who make new accounts to continue\u00a0trolling\u00a0people who have blocked them.\nThis \"whack-a-mole\" problem is a big one for Twitter, which many of its critics have brought up as a consistent weakness in\u00a0the network's anti-harassment policies.\u00a0Twitter started to address\u00a0this before.\u00a0In 2015, the company said it would start asking users suspended for abusive behavior for their phone numbers in order to reinstate their accounts \u2014 phone numbers being\u00a0 at least somewhat more difficult to obtain than an email address .\n[ Twitter\u2019s trying to muzzle its worst trolls with new rules on violent threats ]\nTwitter did not elaborate in the post on how it will expand its efforts to crack down on repeat abusers or give an exact timeline of when users will see this feature.\nThe company also said it is working on altering its search function so\u00a0that\u00a0tweets\u00a0containing \"potentially sensitive\" content \u00a0\u2014 messages that may contain, for example, violence or nudity \u2014 won't show up in a normal search. \u00a0The altered search function will also ignore messages from people a particular user has blocked or muted.\n\"While this type of content will be discoverable if you want to find it, it won\u2019t clutter search results any longer,\" the company's post said, although it didn't say when users will see this on their own accounts.\nThe third change deals with a\u00a0filter of sorts for\u00a0conversations. Twitter, by default, will soon show\u00a0what\u00a0it has judged as the\u00a0most relevant\u00a0replies to a tweet. Others will be hidden behind an expandable bar, labeled \"Less Relevant Replies\" \u2014 messages that Twitter believes may be \"potentially abusive\" or \"low-quality.\"\nThe hope is that the most thoughtful and relevant replies will rise to the top. But, if you want to see the spam, abuse or other messages that don't make the cut for some reason, you'll\u00a0still be able\u00a0to see them by expanding the conversation all the way.\nThe ability to weed out tweets by relevance will roll out in the \"coming weeks,\" Twitter said.\u00a0You can see how that will look in action, here:\nTwitter has\u00a0touted itself for years as a network that supports freedom of expression, which can put it in a tricky position when trying to judge what constitutes abuse.\u00a0But the social network has responded to\u00a0criticism that it hasn't moved quickly enough to fix its abuse problems. Twitter's vice president of engineering, Ed Ho, made this clear last month in a series of tweets that included a promise to move faster to deal with these issues.\nWe heard you, we didn't move fast enough last year; now we're thinking about progress in days and hours not weeks and months.\n\u2014 Ed Ho (@mrdonut) January 31, 2017\nHo said that he and his colleagues know that Twitter users want them to do more to combat\u00a0online abuse \u2014 and fast. \"We're thinking about progress in days and hours not weeks and months,\" he said.\nHayley Tsukayama Hayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post.

That\u2019s what two security researchers are warning, after finding a Mac-based malware that may be an attempt by Iranian hackers to target the U.S. defense industry.\nThe malware, called MacDownloader, was found on a website impersonating the U.S. aerospace firm United Technologies, according to a report from Claudio Guarnieri and Collin Anderson, who are researching Iranian cyberespionage threats.\nThe fake site was previously used in a spear phishing email attack to spread Windows malware and is believed to be maintained by Iranian hackers, the researchers claimed.\n[ Further reading: The best antivirus for Windows PCs ]\nVisitors to the site are greeted with a page about free programs and courses for employees of U.S. defense companies Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing.\nThe malware itself can be downloaded from an Adobe Flash installer for a video embedded in the site. The website will provide either Windows or Mac-based malware, depending on the detected operating system.\nIran Threats\nA screenshot of the fake site.\u00a0\nThe MacDownloader malware was designed to profile the victim's computer, and then steal credentials by generating fake system login boxes and harvesting them from Apple's password management system, Keychain.\nHowever, the malware is of shoddy quality and is \"potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer,\" the researchers said.\nFor instance, once the malware is installed, it'll generate a fake Adobe Flash Player dialog box, only to then announce adware was discovered on the computer that it'll attempt to clean up.\n\"These dialogues are also rife with basic typos and grammatical errors, indicating that the developer paid little attention to quality control,\" the researchers said.\nIn addition, the malware failed to run a script to download additional malicious coding onto the infected Mac. \u00a0\nBut despite the shoddy quality, the malware still managed to evade detection on VirusTotal, which aggregates antivirus scanning engines.\nThe researchers found other circumstantial evidence that the malware is linked to Iran. An exposed server that the MacDownloader agent uploaded to showed wireless networks called \"Jok3r\" and \"mb_1986.\" Both of these names have ties to previous Iranian hacking groups, including one known as Flying Kitten , which is suspected of targeting U.S. defense contractors and political dissidents.\nIn an email, Anderson said a colleague of theirs also observed MacDownloader targeting a human rights activist.\nThe danger is that many human rights supporters, especially in Iran, are dependent on Apple devices, the researchers said. \"While this [malware] is neither sophisticated nor full-featured, its sudden appearance is concerning given the popularity of Apple computers,\" they wrote in their report.\nMac malware is fairly rare, according to security researchers. That's because hackers tend to attack Windows-based devices, because of their popularity.\nHowever, Mac-based malware is still popping up here and there. Last month, researchers found another kind designed to spy on biomedical research centers. A separate Mac-based Trojan was found months earlier, targeting the aerospace industry.\u00a0\nTo comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "127 Tech Companies File Brief Opposing Trump Immigration Ban", "content": "127 Tech Companies File Brief Opposing Trump Immigration Ban\nby Karl Bode\nTuesday Feb 07 2017 10:10 EST\n127 companies (including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel and others) have filed an amicus brief opposing Donald Trump's highly-controversial travel ban. The brief calls the ban both unconstitutional and illegal, highlighting the contributions of immigrants to the tech economy while highlighting the extensive immigration controls already in place to weed out violent extremist threats. It also claims the ban makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to hire new employees, and will make it more difficult for existing employees to conduct business because of travel restrictions.\n\"Skilled individuals will not wish to immigrate to the country if they may be cut off without warning from their spouses, grandparents, relatives, and friends -- they will not pull up roots, incur significant economic risk, and subject their family to considerable uncertainty to immigrate to the United States in the face of this instability,\" the brief says.\nNotably absent from the brief are any telecom companies whatsoever.\nIn fact, outside of Comcast's decision to let its employees protest (for or against the ban, Comcast stated), telecom companies have been dead silent on the controversial restrictions entirely.\nThat's in notable contrast to companies like Uber, which have created a $3 million fund to help defend drivers impacted by the ban. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick also stepped down from his role on Trump's advisory committee after customer backlash . Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, whose companies also signed the brief, has defended his participation on Trump's advisory team, arguing it's a better opportunity to impact policy.\nThe brief was filed in support of a case brought by both Minnesota and Washington state, which challenges Trump\u2019s executive order. The brief is quick to highlight previous immigration law attempts that were struck down for being unconstitutional, including the Literacy Act and the Johnson-Reed Act.\n\"The march of time has discredited these laws and policies,\" the brief states.\n", "language": "en", "date": null, "images": []}
{"title": "PayPal\u2019s first payments bot is a Slack app", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nPayPal this morning is launching a new bot aimed at making it easier for Slack users to send money without ever leaving their preferred work chat platform. This is the first time PayPal has launched a bot, the company claims, though it\u2019s not the first time PayPal has integrated with a larger communication service.\nThis past fall, for example, PayPal\u00a0deepened its relationship with Facebook Messenger, and added the ability for customers to track their transactions within the chat application. It has also been working with merchants to support transactions within their own chatbots on Messenger.\nPayPal, too, has\u00a0integrations with other large platforms, like Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com.\nSimilar to these latter two integrations, PayPal\u2019s\u00a0 Slack bot is\u00a0aimed at end users directly. Available as a Slack app through the company\u2019s online directory, the PayPal bot can be used by typing \u201c/PayPal\u201d followed by your command once\u00a0it\u2019s installed. For example: \u201c/PayPal send $5 to @Dave.\u201d\nThe idea here is that the bot could be used for those quick peer-to-peer payments between co-workers, such as splitting lunch, coffee orders, sharing cab fare, going in on group gifts, and more.\nBefore using it, you\u2019ll need to link your PayPal account and configure your transactions settings, including when you want to review and approve transactions, PayPal says.\nPayPal pointed to Slack\u2019s 5 million daily users as one of the reasons why it chose to launch a bot on its platform. While sizable, there\u2019s also the potential for PayPal to get in early and establish itself as the payments service of choice for Slack users ahead of the company\u2019s further growth and expansions. Slack today has enterprise ambitions, having just announced Enterprise Grid , a product aimed at large corporations.\nAdditionally, peer to peer payments are one of PayPal\u2019s most used features, the company also noted, citing the $41 billion processed across PayPal, Venmo and Xoom in 2015.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Android Wear 2.0 is an evolutionary update to Google\u2019s smartwatch OS", "content": "Frederic Lardinois @fredericl / 2 years\nGoogle is officially launching Android Wear 2.0 today \u2014 the biggest update to the company\u2019s wearable operating system since its launch in 2014.\nIf\u00a0you\u2019re not a Wear aficionado who has been patiently waiting for this release,\u00a0you probably remember Wear 2.0 from its Google I/O announcement last May. Even though in day-to-day use, the updated version feels very much like the next logical evolution of Wear, it took Google far longer than expected to launch it.\n\u201cThe approach that we took as we got started was to build an ecosystem of partners \u2014 so not just do a one-size-fit all solution,\u201d David Singleton, the head of the Google Wear project, told me. \u201cBut build an ecosystem of partners to create a diverse set of styles and sizes. We felt strongly that it was time to work with our traditional \u2014 but also non-traditional \u2014 partners to create this ecosystem.\u201d\nWhile the overall outlook on the market doesn\u2019t always look positive , Singleton argues that Google saw double-digit growth in activations year-over-year. Only looking at the\u00a0holiday season, Google says it saw 70 percent year-over-year growth.\nToday, however, Wear 2.0 is launching with two new flagship watches from LG: the gargantuan, feature-rich LG Watch Sport\u00a0and the comparatively demure and pared-down LG Watch Style. You can find our respective reviews here and here.\u00a0A number of existing Wear watches will also get this update in the coming weeks and months.\nEven though it took Google a few months longer than expected to roll out Wear 2.0, which meant its partners missed the ever-important\u00a0December shopping season, the final version that\u2019s launching today still sticks to the basics Google announced last year. New features include support for standalone apps, Android Pay, dials and \u2014 of course \u2014 the Google Assistant.\nAs Singleton\u00a0stressed, the idea behind all of this work was to\u00a0take what the team learned from how people used the previous version and focus on making exactly those things easier.\nThe one thing Singleton and his team seemed to be especially excited about was the ability to quickly change watch faces in Wear 2.0. In earlier versions,\u00a0you had to perform a long press on the watch face to switch faces. Now you can simply sweep left or right to change them. I admit that I don\u2019t fully share their enthusiasm for this feature, but, to be fair, it does make switching between a work-centric watch face with your calendar\u00a0and\u00a0a fancier one for after work a\u00a0bit easier.\nAs far as the watch faces go, though, the one feature I definitely was able to get excited about is that the new\u00a0designs now have slots for showing data from third-party applications. Maybe you want to see your battery life there, or your steps from Google Fit, or how much water you drank from Lifesum, or the outdoor temperature based on data from the Weather.com app. This is now a deep, built-in feature of Wear 2.0 that allows third-party services\u00a0to make this data available on the watch face. It\u2019s up to the designers to decide how they want to display this info, and the new LG watches already show a couple of different options for this.\nBefore any of this, though, the first thing you\u2019ll notice when you get a 2.0 watch is the overall update to its design \u2014 both in terms of the overall look but also the user experience. The look of Wear 2.0 now skews closer to Google\u2019s Material Design guidelines.\u00a0While\u00a0the overall look will still feel familiar to Wear 1.x users, the update put a stronger emphasis on cards, for example. This means\u00a0every notification now gets a full screen to show its preview and you can use the watch\u2019s dial to scroll through them (assuming your watch has a dial, of course. \u2014 otherwise you can obviously still\u00a0use the touch screen to scroll).\nThe other marquee feature of Wear 2.0 is support for\u00a0standalone apps that don\u2019t need a companion app to run on your phone. That means developers can write apps that are purely geared toward the watch and they can then publish it on the Google Play store, which is now also available directly on the watch. That sounds more useful than it is \u2014 unless you plan on getting an LTE-enabled watch and leave your phone at home. That\u2019s an option now that you could run Hangout or Google Music directly on the watch, but, except for runners, that\u2019s likely not a typical use case. At the end of the day, the most important use case for a smartwatch remains dealing with notifications. Everything else often feels like an unnecessary complication.\nFor the most part, the standalone apps that are available right now aren\u2019t all that exciting either. There also aren\u2019t all that many available right now. Some of the apps Google promised for the launch\u00a0include Foursquare, Robin Hood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Todoist, Nest and Uber. The team specifically singled out Google\u2019s own Fit app, too, which now supports more exercises than before, in addition to an interactive coaching experience.\nTo be fair, Wear 2.0 does make it easier to use\u00a0these apps. To get to them, you only have to push the watch\u2019s dial. In addition, you also can use the dial to scroll through them. Instinctively, I assumed that I could then start an app by pressing the dial again, but that just takes you back to the home screen.\nStill, the additional support for dials and buttons is an admission on Google\u2019s part that smartwatches should have some kind of physical button. The Wear 1.0 launch device \u2014 the LG Watch \u2014 famously didn\u2019t have any physical buttons (not even to turn it on). The new LG Watch Sport however has two buttons and a dial and Wear 2.0 makes it easy to assign various functions to them, too. That makes using these watches easier at times, but it\u2019s\u00a0not exactly a revolutionary breakthrough.\nAndroid Wear now also features a keyboard. That may sound like an insane idea, given how small these watches\u2019 screens are, but because it uses Google\u2019s predictive technology, it works surprisingly well. You wouldn\u2019t want to use if for typing long messages, and it\u2019s really more about swiping than pecking for individual letters, but if you\u2019re in a place where using voice input isn\u2019t an option, it\u2019s a\u00a0good alternative.\nWear has gotten significantly smarter, though. It now features support for the Google Assistant and smart replies. The Assistant on the watch works just as well as on any other device, including the Google Home or the Pixel. There really isn\u2019t much more to say here. Google Now on Android Wear was already pretty useful, too, after all (and where Now ends and the Assistant starts isn\u2019t always clear anyway). It would be nice if you could also type questions so that you could use the Assistant in a quiet room. Singleton says that\u2019s something the team is thinking about.\nSmart Replies may actually be the more exciting feature here. It looks at your conversation and then suggests possible replies based on its understanding. I never found that very useful in Inbox, where this made its debut, but on the go, it sure makes answering messages easier.\u00a0Singleton told me that the algorithms for Smart Replies actually run right on the watch.\nIt\u2019s an evolution\nLooking at the list of features, this\u00a0may not sound like a\u00a0major update and more like a series of incremental updates to existing parts of Wear 1.x. We also ran into our fair share of bugs while testing the new LG watches. After first setting the LG\u00a0Watch Style up, for example, we got stuck in tutorial mode and didn\u2019t receive any notifications until we reset the watch. An emergency patch Google released over the last weekend fixed most of these issues, however, so I assume the final version that rolls out to consumers won\u2019t have these issues.\n\u00a0\nThe new LG watches are interesting in their own ways and they showcase the new features of Wear 2.0. The LG Watch Sport, especially,\u00a0feels like Google and LG wanted to show off every possible feature of Wear 2.0, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make for a great watch. The smaller and cheaper LG Watch Style, on the other hand, shows a more restrained approach.\nThe Android smartwatch market could use a revolution to kickstart what now occasionally feels like a moribund ecosystem. Wear 2.0 doesn\u2019t feel revolutionary. It is, however, a perfectly adequate update that addresses many of the issues with Android Wear. It also puts it on parity with its competitors, like Apple\u2019s watchOS or Samsung\u2019s Tizen. It does\u00a0also introduce some new use cases for LTE-enabled watches, but I can\u2019t help but feel that this will remain a niche category. Much, however, will depend on Google\u2019s hardware partners who will now have to bring Wear 2.0 to life.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-08T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

No ministry has yet taken a final decision on any of those. But we are in touch with them,\" Abhishek told reporters here.\nHe said the government supports all manufacturing, including value manufacturing, in the country by companies. \"So we would definitely like to promote this. So we are coordinating response from all the concerned ministries but no final view has been taken yet on any of those,\" he said. The secretary also clarified that the government does not take any policy decision for a particular company.\n\"Decision is taken for everyone. So no company specific decision can be taken,\" he said, adding that DIPP has forwarded the requests of Apple to the Department of Revenue also.\nOn 25 January, Apple Inc indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but wants fiscal concessions, including customs duty waiver on import of components. Apple executives made a detailed presentation on its road map for setting up a manufacturing unit in India to an inter-ministerial group headed by Abhishek.\nWith sales tapering in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India -- the fastest growing smartphone market in the world -- and is looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs.\nIt makes devices through contract manufacturers. Besides exemption from the customs duty on imports of components and equipment for 15 years, Apple wants relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components.\nIn a communication to the government, the Cupertino-based technology major has asked for several tax and other incentives, including long-term duty exemptions, to enter the manufacturing sector in India.\nCurrently, the government provides support by way of benefits under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) to boost electronic manufacturing.\nThe company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.\nPTI\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Apple is now working on an intermediary accessory for making lightning headphones compatible with USB-C and vice-versa.\nAs we\u2019ve said in the past, the removal of the headphone jack was a very bad idea, and we\u2019re paying the price for it.\nWhen it replaced the headphone jack, Apple was left with no other option than to use the only port the iPhone had left, the Lightning port. The problem is that the Lightning port is far from an industry standard and only headphones designed for the Lightning port will work on that port.\nMany Android device manufacturers decided to dump the headphone jack as well, and since they couldn\u2019t go with the Lightning port, they went with USB-C audio.\nFurther convoluting the problem is that the new MacBook\u2019s don\u2019t even have Lightning ports, so those Lightning EarPods you received with your brand new iPhone 7 will not connect to the new MacBooks.\nRather than reinstate the headphone jack and move on from this mess, Apple seems to think it best to add yet another dongle to the mix. This one is being called the Ultra Accessory Connector (UAC), reports 9to5Mac .\nThankfully, the UAC port isn\u2019t a proprietary one and is, as The Verge confirms, the same 8-pin connector that you would have seen on certain models of cameras, including Nikon DSLRs.\nThe UAC has reportedly been launched as a developer preview for partners under Apple\u2019s Made For iPhone (MFi) program. Under the program, manufacturers will be permitted to make Lightning to UAC, USB-A to UAC, and 3.5mm jack to UAC accessories.\nApple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

This project is only intended to test the waters while Apple gauges the response from the government and the feasibility of setting up operations here.\nThe Karnataka government is understandably excited regardless. Any manufacturing by Apple in the state is a huge boost to the State\u2019s portfolio, which is looking to attract more startups and manufacturing there.\nApple has presented a long list of demands to the government and expects them to be met before it commits to production in our country.\nThe list includes a 15-year customs exemption on certain components (the iPhone has barely been around for 10-years), relaxation of local sourcing norms and more.\nThe government and Apple have been cautious with their public response to these demands and the only thing we know for sure is that the government officials are \u201c considering \u201d the demands.\nOther manufacturers in India currently adhere to all the rules laid down by the government and exceptions will have to be made specifically for Apple.

Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation.\"\nShe continues: \"If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland.\"\nMargrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, says the ruling against Apple stands.\nCredit:AP\nThis leads to Trump's tax plan . He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate.\nA report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) , a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal.\n\"I've met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we've chatted a little,\" Duan said. \"I like him a lot.\"\nCredit:AP\n\"Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated,\" the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings.\nTrump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion.\nITEP report\nOrdinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe.\nNo wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.\nBut it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday.\nThe ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore \u2013 Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America.\nThe report suggests that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate.\n\"In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion,\" it says.\nRather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings.\nMeanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures.\nApple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures.\nAccording to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016.\nIts profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years.\nThe tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-09T19:24:08Z", "images": []}

There\u2019s still been essentially a round-robin at the top, but toward the end of last year Twitter tried to streamline the company with a big round of layoffs as it tried to return to growth. That turnover at the top \u2014 like the company\u2019s CTO Adam Messinger and VP of product Josh McFarland leaving in December \u2014 is likely not helping Dorsey\u2019s case.\nThat didn\u2019t help in the fourth quarter, where Twitter not only missed revenue targets set by Wall Street but also saw its advertising business reverse course and drop year-over-year. Twitter\u2019s shares dropped\u00a0another 10% following the earnings call, continuing to compound problems with Dorsey\u2019s case that he can continue to run both companies in an effective way. Since returning as CEO of Twitter, the stock hasn\u2019t had a very good run and really the only bright spot happened when talks of the company getting acquired bubbled up late last year.\nAs that stock price continues to drop off and pressure mounts, Twitter \u2014 and Dorsey \u2014 are going to be in the crosshairs. The company is going to be increasingly attractive to activist investors that may see an opportunity to swoop in and rejigger the upper levels of the company in order to look at different ways to start generating revenue and return it to growth. We\u2019ve seen it happen before in the case of Yahoo, and activist agitation from investors like Carl Icahn even prompted Apple to increase the amount of value it\u2019s returning to shareholders.\nWhether or not the company\u2019s issues lie with other parts of the team, its core legacy products or otherwise, the blame for poor performance is largely going to land on the CEO. Twitter executives on the earnings call said they were going to redistribute resources to focus on advertising products that were working and growing, which could lead to de-emphasizing other products that were already generating revenue. So that, in the short-term, may impact the company\u2019s ability to regenerate revenue.\nIn short, this is going to be a big sticking point going forward. Twitter is going to try to move faster this year, Dorsey said on the earnings call, and the team and infrastructure the company has set up is going to contribute to that. Twitter\u2019s largely incremental changes over the course of time are also contributing to increased engagement, he said. But it means that Dorsey is basically saying Twitter will deliver this year, and if it doesn\u2019t Twitter may end up being another target for Wall Street to come in and try to re-organize.\n\u201cLate last year, we really flattened the org\u2026 so I could be closer to the product,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve spent a year going through and making sure we reset the foundation on what we\u2019re executing and what our priorities are, we have a lot more confidence that we can move a lot faster on bigger things.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-09T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Still, Fast Company reports that Apple may be switching from LCD displays to an OLED display, which would cost the company more to make the phone. The report also cites sources as saying that the memory in the next iPhone will be upgraded, another contributing factor to the rising cost.\nThis forthcoming phone represents 10 years of the iPhone, leading many to believe that Apple may call it \u201ciPhone X.\u201d\nRumors suggest that the next flagship iPhone will measure in at 5.8-inches, which is a bit bigger than the iPhone 7 Plus.\nDiverging a bit from the current strategy, the next iPhone is said to be released alongside two models that are the same size as the iPhone 7 (4.7-inch) and iPhone 7 Plus (5.5-inch), which will likely be called the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus respectively.\nTrusted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Quo wrote late last year that only the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) will come with the new OLED display.\nAlong with the new display and the bigger size, rumors suggest that the back of the phone will be made of glass, and that the sides of the phone will be made of stainless steel instead of aluminum.\nBut perhaps more exciting is that Apple may be ditching the Home button, placing it under the display for a fully touch interface. In fact, sources are claiming that the next iPhone may not have any physical buttons, instead using touch-sensitive portions of metal for the volume/lock buttons.\nOf course, Apple isn\u2019t expected to announce the next phone until Fall 2017, so nothing is set in stone. But if the OLED rumors in particular hold true, you might want to start prepping your bank account for a slightly more expensive purchase come September.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-09T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

They said the federal law allowing the searches goes \u201cfar beyond any necessary limits\u201d and infringes users\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased this ruling enables our case to move forward toward a reasonable solution that works for law enforcement and ensures secrecy is used only when necessary,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, said in a statement.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the ruling while the department reviews it.\nThe Justice Department and Lynch defended the searches, saying they need digital tools to help fight increasingly sophisticated criminals and terrorists who are savvy at using technology to communicate and hide their tracks.\nFourth Amendment\nIn the portion of Thursday\u2019s ruling that sided with the government, the judge said he could not reconcile the company\u2019s attempt to assert the Fourth Amendment protection against invasive searches on behalf of its customers with earlier court decisions. Other courts have found that such rights can only be asserted by individuals, and not vicariously by third parties, he said.\nStill, Robart recognized that the law used by the government to block Microsoft from informing users about searches \u201cmeans customers whose accounts have been accessed by the government may never know of the search.\u201d\nSecrecy orders on government warrants for access to private e-mail accounts generally prohibit Microsoft from telling customers about the requests for lengthy or even unlimited periods, the company said when it sued. At the time, federal courts had issued almost 2,600 secrecy orders to Microsoft alone, and more than two-thirds had no fixed end date. In those cases, the company can never tell customers about government searches, even after an investigation is completed.\nThe industry\u2019s push against government intrusion into their customers\u2019 private information began in the wake of Edward Snowden\u2019s 2013 disclosures about covert-data collection that put internet companies on the defensive.\nMicrosoft concedes that there may be times when the government is justified in seeking a gag order to prevent customers under investigation from tampering with evidence or harming another person. Still, the company contends the statute authorizing the gag orders is too broad and sets too low of a standard for secrecy.\nThe case is Microsoft Corp. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 16-cv-00538, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).\n\u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass\n( Updates with Justice Department spokeswoman in ninth paragraph.)\nPublished on\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-09T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Most Touch Bar support has come from Apple and its own software, such as Maps and Safari, but a few third-party programs, including Adobe Photoshop, have followed suit.\nThe update, which was issued to the \"slow\" track of the Office Insider program, was announced via Twitter and in a message posted to Microsoft's support forum .\nSubscribers to the consumer versions of Office 365, including Home, Personal and University, may participate in the Insider scheme on the Mac by checking the \"Join the Office Insider program to get early access to new releases\" box in the Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) utility. Users can display MAU by selecting \"Check for Updates\" from any Office application's Help menu. The slow or fast tracks can be selected from the field labeled \"Choose how you get Insider builds.\"\nMicrosoft launched Office Insider on the Mac more than a year ago.\nThe debut of Touch Bar support in Office came about three months after the unveiling of the MacBook Pro laptops. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was about how long it took Microsoft to add support for a new high-resolution display, dubbed Retina, after Apple upgraded the screen of the 15-in. MacBook Pro in mid-2012.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-09T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Ming-Chi Kuo: iPhone 8 wireless charging a sure thing, new touch controls may be in store", "content": "\u203a\nMing-Chi Kuo: iPhone 8 wireless charging a sure thing, new touch controls may be in store\nMing-Chi Kuo: iPhone 8 wireless charging a sure thing, new touch controls may be in store\nPosted:\nTags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple +\nThe purported unique 10th anniversary edition of the Apple iPhone is shaping up to be one for the ages. Dubbed tentatively the iPhone 8 or iPhone X to differentiate it from the regular LCD-equipped iPhone 7s and 7s Plus upgrades (again tentative names), it will eventually ship with a wraparound flexible OLED display , huge battery and dual camera.\n\u00a0\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a proven track record in predicting upcoming iPhone features based on supply chain sources, now adds wireless charging to the mix as a sure thing, both for the iPhone X , and for the 7s and 7s Plus. The issue, however, is that the OLED iPhone is said to be all-glass, with only a thin stainless steel frame sandwiched in-between . Here came the challenge for Apple's engineers, tipped the analyst, as wireless charging generates heat, and glass is a poorer heat conductor than metal.\u00a0\nIn addition, Apple is reportedly prepping a brand new 3D Touch experience on the all-glass phone , which would require a new layer of film, and that one is apparently more prone to heat than the existing solution on iPhone 6s /7. Therefore, says Ming-Chi Kuo in a note to clients, Apple will be installing a graphene sheet in the upcoming iPhone 8 , to help dissipate the extra warmth generated by the wireless charging coil, and prevent heat damage.\u00a0\nOf course, the end iPhone user doesn't really care what extra laminated layer has Apple installed to prevent overheating, but they might notice the enhanced 3D Touch experience that the analyst talks about. For us, this is the more interesting take from his memo. Wireless charging is not all that exciting, unless Apple has cracked the code of charging your iPhone from across the room without frying your brainwaves in the process.\nA brand new 3D Touch layer that would differ from what's on other iPhones, though? Could it be that the rumors about a new way of navigation and interaction with the iPhone 8, including a move to touch-sensitive volume and other buttons hold water? Now this would be something to shout from the rooftops, and there are all indications that Apple is cooking something unique for the 10th iPhone anniversary, and not only in terms of hardware or design changes.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-10T08:00:00Z", "images": []}

You may like them, you may not; but that tight connection generally makes phones, tablets, computers and all sorts of electronics work better. However, there\u2019s an additional tile to it, one that Xiaomi is seemingly prepping to integrate\u2026\nWe are talking, obviously, about processors. Certain phones, like Google \u2018s Pixel , while enjoying the vertical integration given by hardware and software ( HTC \u2018s hand notwithstanding) still use components from third-party OEMs, namely Qualcomm \u2018s Snapdragon 821 SoC.\nAnd so does Xiaomi, which used the same chip in its gorgeous Mi Mix . But that may be about to change, as the Wall Street Journal reports , with the Chinese firm reportedly looking into releasing\u00a0SoCs for, at least, the top-tier phones in its pipeline.\nThe development cycle seems to be in full swing, too; the WSJ is reporting that Xiaomi\u2019s intention is to launch the chip \u2014 codenamed \u201cPinecone\u201d \u2014 no later than next month, which means that we may very well see it in action come the end of 2017.\nIt\u2019s a move that would bring its brand closer to other high-end players such as Apple and Samsung , and make sense in the firm\u2019s vision that implies a bigger expansion in markets outside their homeland of China.\nA TrendForce research director, Sean Yang, had this to say: \u201cA phone maker can only reach the pinnacle of user experience when optimizing the integration of hardware and software on its own.\u201d\nIt certainly is a \u201crisky\u201d move, as Mark Li, a Bernstein Research industry analyst, puts it, as \u201cthe resources required to develop competitive mobile chips are high\u201d; and that builds on top of Xiaomi losing positions to Oppo , Huawei and even Apple in 2016, after strong performances in the previous year, and other executive shifts like the loss of Hugo Barra to Facebook .\nBut the company that brought the Mi Mix to the world is certainly one that has proved they are able to push the industry forward \u2014 something that smartphones desperately need \u2014 and we very much look forward to seeing what\u2019s next.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Apple's iPhone declines in China, and this year could be a struggle", "content": "Smartphones\nApple's iPhone declines in China, and this year could be a struggle\nApple's iPhone shipments in China declined by double digits in 2016, and Chinese brands are threatening more than ever\nEmail a friend\nUse commas to separate multiple email addresses\nFrom\nYour message has been sent.\nSorry\n| Feb 9, 2017 8:34 AM PT\nSusie Ochs\nCurrent Job Listings\nPerhaps the next iPhone 8 will be Apple's next shot at achieving greatness in China.\nThe current iPhones aren't helping Apple gain market share in China, according to Canalys. Markets like China and India are at the top of Apple's agenda to grow the iPhone business.\nChina accounts for a third of worldwide smartphone shipments. Buyers in the market are leaning toward local brands like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, which formed the top four smartphone vendors in China in 2016, according to Canalys.\nRELATED: 8 reasons the Apple Watch is more trouble than it is worth\nApple was in the fifth spot, and Samsung doesn't figure in the top five.\nIn 2016, Apple's phone shipments in China totaled 43.8 million units, a drop of 18.2 percent compared to 2015. It's not looking any better for Apple in 2017.\n\"This year, the outlook remains bleak for Apple to get its China performance back to its heyday of 2015,\" said Jessie Ding, a research analyst at Canalys.\nThe decline in China hit Apple's worldwide shipments hard, with a net effect of about a 7 percent decline in the number of iPhones shipped globally, Ding said.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\nBut the Chinese buyers are \"awaiting the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with very high expectations,\" Ding said.\nThe iPhone 8 may succeed, but it may not change a long-term trend of Chinese smartphone buyers buying local brands.\nIn many smaller Chinese cities, Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo smartphones are selling well. Those companies are also investing heavily in branding in top-tier cities, posing a further threat to Apple, Ding said.\nApple faces a similar problem in India. The iPhone brand awareness is limited to urban areas, and the handsets are priced too high for most of the population. Apple recently made a move to start assembling smartphones in India.\nMany Chinese companies are launching new handsets this year with a focus on cameras and screens. One such smartphone is Huawei's Mate 9 Pro, which was shown at CES. Huawei -- known for networking gear -- also makes its own chips, like Apple and Samsung.\nOther Chinese brands like LeEco are also emerging and growing internationally. LeEco has particularly interesting smartphone designs. The company came out with a\u00a0smartphone without a headphone jack ahead of Apple.\nIt's a tight race among the top three Chinese smartphone makers. Huawei in 2016 shipped 76.2 million units, Oppo shipped 73.2 million units, and Vivo about 63.2 million units. Xiaomi's market share tumbled, declining by 21 percent to 51.4 million units.\nA survey released by IDC this week also noted a down market for iPhone in China, but placed the company in the\u00a0fourth spot, ahead of Xiaomi. According to IDC, total smartphone shipments in China were 467 million units in 2016, growing by 8.7 percent.\nBut Apple's shipments declined by 23.2 percent that year, totaling 44.9 million units. The top three Chinese smartphone makers were Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo, according to IDC.\nJoin the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-09T13:34:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Explained: Apple iCloud kept 'deleted' browser histories for over a year", "content": "SHARE \u25bc\nApple appears to have fixed a flaw in iCloud that retained a copy of deleted Safari browsing history data synced from local devices for more than a year.\nOn Thursday, Russian computer forensics software biz Elcomsoft said that its forensic software was able to recover Safari browser history records that had been stored in iCloud and erased, including the date the URLs were last visited and when the deletion occurred.\nVladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft, in a blog post highlighted the forensic value of browsing data. Because iCloud sync works continuously, if enabled by the user, it's particularly useful for surveillance and investigations, he suggested.\nShortly after the publication of Elcomsoft's findings, Apple took undisclosed steps to address the issue. According to Katalov, Safari browser history data stored in iCloud now only dates back two weeks, deleted or not.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe speed with which Apple chose to address the issue suggests something of the information's potential value. Apple presumably wanted to avoid the burden of complying with a surge of demands for data assumed to be lost.\nRegardless, the company had to act to meet its data retention commitment in its Legal Process Guidelines : \"Apple does not retain deleted content once it is cleared from Apple's servers.\"\nApple says it retains iCloud connection logs up to 30 days and iCloud mail logs for up to 60 days.\nThis isn't the first time Apple's data retention reality hasn't matched its policy. In November, Elcomsoft found that iCloud was storing iPhone call histories without notification or consent. Apple has since fixed that issue.\nThe previous availability of deleted Safari browsing data isn't all that significant in the range of possible privacy failures. First, someone using Elcomsoft's software would have to know the user's account name and password to access iCloud data, or would have to be in a position to demand account information from Apple through the established legal process.\nIn the context of an investigation, Google and the suspect's ISP are likely to have a more comprehensive picture of online activities than iCloud backups.\nWhat's more, the user would have had to opt in to having Safari data synchronized to iCloud.\nAs to the technical nature of the flaw, we can only speculate, since Apple did not respond to a request for an explanation.\nOne possible cause might be a client-side bug with the way Safari or the iCloud sync software handles data. Safari stores history data in an SQLite database. A Stack Overflow post from more than a year ago suggests that deleting these files doesn't always work. So perhaps a local browser storage flaw \u2013 using a cached file when the original can't be found, for example, or a file lock that prevents removal \u2013 keeps deleted records around and syncs them.\nIt's equally possible the issue could reflect an iCloud bug.\nIf privacy is a serious concern, avoid iCloud and cloud services in general. \u00ae\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Twitter's stagnant business, in one chart", "content": "Twitter's stagnant business, in one chart\nJeff Dunn\nEmail\nThings are not looking up for Twitter. While the micro-blogging service has become the platform du jour for the leader of the free world, its numbers continue to fall below expectations.\nThe company reported its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, and as this chart from Statista shows, it only furthered an ongoing slump. Revenue was up by less than 1% from the year-ago quarter, advertising revenue was down, and the company warned of weaker-than-anticipated revenue growth going forward.\nThat last bit has caused Twitter\u2019s stock to sink more than 11% as of Thursday afternoon.\nTo be fair, the company\u2019s monthly user base did grow, albeit slightly, and the service itself has become an integral part of the daily news.

{"title": "Report again claims Apple will add 5-inch iPhone to lineup, sell wireless charging tech separately", "content": "Report again claims Apple will add 5-inch iPhone to lineup, sell wireless charging tech separately\nReddit\nAccording to a new report from Macotakara, Apple will introduce a new 5-inch iPhone model to the lineup this year. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard of a new 5-inch iPhone model, though.\nAdditionally, today\u2019s report, which cites \u201creliable sources in Taiwan,\u201d only the all-glass model of the iPhone will support wireless charging this year, while Apple will also stop including the headphone jack adapter.\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\nMost recently, it was reported that Apple will add a 5-inch iPhone to its product lineup with a vertical dual-camera design. This model is said to be nearly identical in terms of specifications to the \u201ciPhone 7s\u201d and \u201ciPhone 7s Plus.\u201d\nOne oft-rumored feature for this year\u2019s iPhone refresh is wireless charging . While some reports have claimed that wireless charging will be supported on all iPhone models introduced this year, this report claims that only the glass model will support the feature. This means that only the top-tier iPhone 8, which is expected to come in at $1000+ , will support wireless charging.\nWhile the translation is somewhat unclear, today\u2019s report also seems to corroborate other recent reports claiming that the iPhone 8 will use inductive wireless charging rather than long-range. The technology is said to be supplied by Luxshare, a manufacturer that has supplied wireless charging tech for Apple Watch.\nFurthermore, the report claims that Apple will not include the wireless charging technology in the box. Instead, users will have to purchase the accessory separately.\nOne other detail of today\u2019s report is that Apple will not include the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone adapter with the purchase of any iPhone released this year. Apple, of course, ditched the 3.5mm jack with the iPhone 7 lineup, but did include an adapter in the box as to not render traditional headphones useless. Now that Apple\u2019s W1 headphones are available , though, it shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise that it won\u2019t include that adapter this year.\nWhile some had speculated that Apple could include a USB-C to Lightning cable this year, rather than USB-A to Lightning,\u00a0today\u2019s report puts in axe in that thought, as well.\nFurthermore, they\u2019re finished putting the headphone jack adapter in the package, and continue to sell the USB-C cable separately.\nToday\u2019s report comes following several other iPhone reports this week. One report offered some details on the flagship model, claiming that it will come in at over $1000 and include some sort of 3D sensor technology.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening as Friday begins and a \u201chorrifying\u201d three-day heatwave hits Australia\u2019s east coast.\nFirst, the scoreboard (8:00am AEDT):\n\u2022 Dow: 20172 +118 (+0.6%)\n\u2022 S&P 500: 2307 +13 (+0.5%)\n\u2022 SPI 200 Futures (March): 5,635 +36 (+0.6%)\n\u2022 AUD/USD: 0.7630 -0.0015 (-0.20%)\nAnd the news.\n1. US stocks hit record high: President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax reform was all it took to bring back the reflation trade. The S&P 500 index scampered away to hit a record high, the dollar jumped, Treasuries and gold fell after Trump said that administration will announce \u201csomething phenomenal in terms of tax\u201d over \u201cthe next two or three weeks.\u201d Australian shares are poised to open higher.\n2. Lowe on the Aussie : Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe, during a speech delivered to A50 Australian Economic Forum Dinner in Sydney, remarked that it was \u201chard to say if Australian dollar is too high given the reasonable growth outlook\u201d. He also said some strengthening in employment growth might coming and the RBA continues to pay close attention to the housing market and household balance sheets.\n3. Blankfein says all will be OK: Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has heard so may people talk about uncertainty in the markets lately that , he says, it\u2019s starting to sound \u201ctrite\u201d. So in a recent video posted on Goldman Sachs\u2019 website, Blankfein delved into the causes of that uncertainty and why, in his view, everything is going to be OK. Under Trump, we can expect to see less regulation, rather than more; lower taxes, rather than higher; and a bigger commitment to infrastructure spending, Blankfein said. That has boosted GDP expectations and optimism.\n4. Data today: All eyes on the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy where updated economic growth and inflation forecast will be revealed. Attention will be on the central bank\u2019s underlying inflation forecast for 2019. China reports balance of trade and Japan releases PPI.

Next phase of currency cold war : Cold wars are not fought in open battle but with covert actions and words, money manager PIMCO says. Joachim Fels explained how the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) opened the cold currency war through guarded actions that contributed to the depreciation of their currencies against the dollar during the second half of 2016. Yet he also said the US\u2019s \u201cbenign neglect seems unlikely to survive Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office\u201d.\n9. Apple takes on Aussie lenders: The global head of Apple Pay has put three of Australia\u2019s big banks on notice that the technology giant\u2019s global payments system will steal their customers and they risk being left behind in the development of digital wallets, the Australian Financial Review reports . Only ANZ Bank out of the big four Australian lenders uses Apple Pay now.

{"title": "Ford to invest $1B in Argo AI, to take on Tesla, Uber in autonomous vehicle race", "content": "Ford to invest $1B in Argo AI, to take on Tesla, Uber in autonomous vehicle race\nposted on 11th February 2017\nAdd to\nComments\nShare\nFord Motor Company on Saturday\u00a0 announced \u00a0that it would be investing $1 billion during the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company, to develop a virtual driver system for the company's\u00a0autonomous vehicle. Argo AI\u2019s initial focus will be to support Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicle development and production efforts. In the future, Argo AI could license its technology to other companies and sectors looking for autonomous capability. Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, SAE level 4-capable vehicle for commercial application in mobility services in 2021.\nL to R- Peter Rander, Argo AI COO; Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO; Bryan Salesky, Argo AI CEO; and Raj Nair, Ford executive vice president\nStory so far\nFounded by Bryan Salesky (the company's CEO), and Peter Rander (COO), Argo AI has brought together an experienced team of roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from inside and outside of Ford. Salesky and Rander are alumni of Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center and former leaders on the self-driving car teams of Google and Uber, respectively. Ford President and CEO Mark Fields noted,\nThe next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford\u2019s moving assembly line did 100 years ago.\nThe current team developing Ford\u2019s virtual driver system \u2013 the machine-learning software that acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles \u2013 will be combined with the robotics talent and expertise of Argo AI. This partnership will work to deliver the virtual driver system for Ford\u2019s SAE level 4 self-driving vehicles.\nFord will continue to lead on development of its purpose-built autonomous vehicle hardware platform, as well as on systems integration, manufacturing, exterior and interior design, and regulatory policy management.Argo AI will join forces with Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicle software development effort to strengthen the commercialisation of self-driving vehicles.\u00a0Salesky said,\nWe are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move.\nAlso complementing the relationship will be Ford Smart Mobility LLC, which will lead on the commercialisation strategy for Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles. This includes choices for using autonomous vehicles to move goods and people, such as ride-sharing, ride hailing or package delivery fleets.\nCompetitive advantage over Tesla and Uber?\n\u201cWorking together with Argo AI gives Ford a distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the automotive and technology industries,\u201d said Raj Nair, Ford executive VP, Global Product Development, and Chief Technical Officer. He also noted that partnership allows them to\u00a0benefit from combining the speed of a startup with Ford\u2019s strengths in scaling technology, systems integration and vehicle design.\nThe autonomous vehicle sector though is seeing a lot of activity with both legacy players and new-age startups looking to get a heads up on the competition. Elon Musk's Tesla is also one of the most formidable players in this space. While many of Tesla vehicles had cruise control and autopilot \u00a0modes, the\u00a0Palo Alto headquartered company announced in October 2016 that all it vehicles would have full self-driving hardware. While they have achieved partial-autonomy Musk noted in his 'Master Plan Part 2' that he aims to develop self-driving capabilities that are 10x safer than manual transport. Automaker Daimler is an investor in Tesla.\nIn August 2016, after much speculation Uber officially announced its entry into the self-driving space by acquiring tech startup Otto and also partnering with Volvo. Then in October 2016, Otto successfully made the world\u2019s first shipment by a self-driving truck by delivering\u00a051,744 beers and travelling un-assisted for\u00a0120-miles. According to a recent report from CB Insights , as many as 33 global corporations including tech giants like Apple and Google and car makers like BMW and Audi are working on autonomous vehicles.\nTerms of the agreement\nAs a part of the deal, Ford will be the majority stakeholder in Argo AI. But Ford notes that Argo AI been structured to operate with substantial independence. Its employees will have significant equity participation in the company, enabling them to share in its success. Argo AI\u2019s board will have five members: Nair; John Casesa, Ford group vice president, Global Strategy; Salesky; Rander; and an independent director.\nThe $1-billion investment in Argo AI will be made over five years and is consistent with the autonomous vehicle capital allocation plan shared last September as part of Ford Investor Day. By the end of this year, Argo AI expects to have more than 200 team members, based in the company\u2019s Pittsburgh headquarters and at major sites in Southeastern Michigan and the Bay Area of California.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-11T12:34:18Z", "images": []}

The Apple-focused news website and community Cult of Mac, once called him \" the most reliable voice on all things Apple...because his ability to accurately prophesy Apple's future product plans is unparalleled.\"\nFirst reported by MacRumors , Kuo's research note indicated that wireless charging increases the internal temperature of smartphones, which will require the iPhone 8 with an OLED display and glass casing to have a new 3D Touch module with \"additional graphite sheet lamination\" to keep it from overheating.\n\"While we don't expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone,\" Kuo wrote in his research note.\nPrevious MacRumors reports indicate the iPhone 8's additional features could bump the cost of making the smartphone from 30% to 50% higher -- pushing its sale to more than $1,000 .\nThis is not the first time industry analysts have speculated that Apple is about to embrace wireless charging for the iPhone. Last year, market research firm IHS predicted that Apple would introduce some form of wireless charging on the iPhone 7.\nIf the latest prediction pans out, Apple would be following other smartphone makers, many of which offer wireless charging on at least some of their models.\nThree years ago, the Windows Phone 8-based Lumia 920 smartphone introduced wireless charging. Then Samsung launched dual-mode wireless charging on its Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones.\nThe three major wireless charging industry groups have adopted a form of resonant wireless charging, which allows a more \"loosely coupled\" approach where handsets can be several centimeters away from a charger or placed at any angle on a charging pad.\nFor example, AirFuel Alliance's Rezence-specification allows charging from across several centimeters and allows for the use of a charging bowl or charging through a desktop.\nThere's also uncoupled charging technology, where powering up devices through Wi-Fi, for example, sends low levels of power (typically less than 1 watt) across a room.\nApple, however, may choose to use its own proprietary form of wireless charging, as it did when it introduced an inductive, wireless charging solution in 2015 on the Apple Watch.\nApple\nThe Apple Watch, launched in 2015, uses a proprietary form of inductive wireless charging.\nUnlike resonant wireless charging, or loosely coupled wireless charging, inductive charging requires direct contact with the device as well as a more precise positioning on the charging pad.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "A union is the least of Tesla's problems  --  but it could have far-reaching implications for Silicon Valley", "content": "Email\nTesla is facing a potential unionization effort by workers at its Fremont, CA factory.\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, least of all Tesla itself. The factory was a union shop when it was jointly operated by Toyota and General Motors and known as NUMMI.\nTesla acquired the plant and didn\u2019t operate it as a union facility, and because it was so far off the map of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), whose workforce is concentrated in the Midwest, it didn\u2019t make much difference.\nIf the UAW were going to unionize a plant, it wanted to focus on the US South, where \u201cright to work\u201d laws make unionizing more difficult and where numerous foreign car companies have established factories over the past 40 years. (The most recent example was a failed effort to unionize a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee.)\nThe workforce at Tesla is paid on par with what are known as Tier 2 wages for the UAW, starting at about $17 an hour. Tier 1 UAW workers start at $28. For what it\u2019s worth, the UAW accepted this two-tiered structure in 2007 when the US automakers were being flattened by the lead-up to financial crisis, but it didn\u2019t like it and has fought to modify or roll it back ever since.\nThe new contracts that were negotiated with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Ford, and GM in 2015 began the process of eliminating the detested two tiers, which for the union violated the principle of \u201cequal pay for equal work\u201d for members.\nBut the lower-wage scale prevails in the non-union part of the business, which includes Tesla.\nBecause California isn\u2019t a right-to-work state, Tesla had to expect the UAW to arrive at some point, and rumblings began last year that a union push was underway. Those rumours have been confirmed by some recent activity, which has already been commented on by CEO Elon Musk .\nMusk says Tesla is \u2018union neutral\u2019\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\nThe Tesla factory today.\nCaught up in this are some claims that Tesla\u2019s workers are dealing with a lot of mandatory overtime and a hazardous workplace. There\u2019s no question that Tesla has run hard at times during the past two years, as the company works to ramp up production of its Model S sedan, Model X SUV, and prepares to build the Model 3 mass-market vehicle. Auto plants can also be physically demanding places to work.\nMusk has defined Tesla a \u201cunion neutral,\u201d which can simply be translated as \u201cthe workforce can attempt to unionize if it wants.\u201d Tesla\u2019s workers can join with the UAW to file for a union vote with the National Labour Relations Board, and if the vote is in favour of collective bargaining, then the UAW, Tesla\u2019s workers, and Tesla management would negotiate a contract that would likely resemble what the union achieved with the Detroit Big Three (a tricky issue might involve Tesla stock options, but the UAW typically negotiated profit-sharing with the traditional industry.)\nCalifornia has a huge and diverse economy, and a lot of it is unionized (from education to Hollywood). This was one of the business risks Tesla took when it decided to buy the Fremont plant. The company could have set up operations in Georgia or South Carolina.\nBut a functioning car factory right next door to Silicon Valley was just too good to pass up (the price was also right).\nAnd therein lies the larger issue that a unionization effort at Tesla \u2014 which, by the way, isn\u2019t guaranteed to succeed \u2014 brings up.\nThe Silicon Valley factor\nThere\u2019s a better-than-average chance that Tesla could be unionized. Such an outcome wouldn\u2019t be shocking at all, because Tesla is an American car company and all the other US manufacturers are union, plus California is a union-friendly state. The NLRB is a slight wildcard, as the Trump administration will get to appoint some of its members, and typically the Republican-administration appointees aren\u2019t as labour-oriented as Democratic appointees.\nIf Tesla unionizes, it would be the first new car company to join the UAW in decades, but more importantly, it will be the first Silicon Valley company to vote for collective bargaining.\nApple\nApple\u2019s planned campus in Silicon Valley. Unions see the tech industry as potentially a great opportunity.\nThis highlights the schizophrenic nature of Tesla\u2019s existence \u2014 and explains why Musk calls the company \u201cunion neutral.\u201d Tesla is a high-tech Silicon Valley startup and, increasingly, a major automaker, at the same time. Musk knows that car companies employ unionized workers and wouldn\u2019t deny that fact of life.\nBut he also wants to preserve the rapid-growth, tech-firm mentality that drives Tesla to develop stuff like Autopilot semi-self-driving systems and frequent over-the-air software updates for its cars.\nThe rest of Silicon Valley is completely unreceptive to the idea of unionization even though from the perspective of some engineers and programmers collective bargaining might make sense. But the majority of knowledge workers tend to associate unions with blue-collar labour and old-school industries.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped organised labour from seeing Silicon Valley as a plum opportunity. There are thousands of workers putting in long hours and making good money, but they are also aiming for big payouts that are statistically improbable. In many ways, Silicon Valley resembles, in the eyes of organised labour, Hollywood \u2014 but a Hollywood updated for the 21st century. And Hollywood is unionized from top to bottom, from the below-the-line people who hang the lights to the highest-paid actors and actresses.\nConsequently, a Tesla union would be a very big deal \u2014 for unions and Silicon Valley, not so much for Tesla.\nThe entertainment business is heavily unionized.\nA shock wave through the tech industry\nIf Tesla determined that a union was likely at Fremont, the company probably wouldn\u2019t waste a lot of time fighting against it. With the Model 3 entering pre-production this month, it\u2019s late 2017 launch is almost a near-certainty. But the carmaker has a lot riding on steady, uninterrupted execution for the rest of the year. Many things could go wrong, so having to deal with a UAW contract is really the least of Tesla\u2019s worries.\nMusk also probably doesn\u2019t want Tesla\u2019s recent stock rally, which has added $10 billion to the company\u2019s market cap (now at $40 billion), to be undermined by investors questions about the cost of the union battle.\nThe broader impact on Silicon Valley is another story. It\u2019s safe to say that a significant portion of the tech industry would be confused and horrified if Tesla unionized. They might not be able to expect much opposition from the Trump administration, which rode into office thanks to traditional UAW bastions such as Ohio and Michigan voting Republican. Trump needs hiring by car companies in the Midwest, and that means more, not fewer, union jobs.\nSo as with all things Tesla, it will be well worth watching to see if this unionization campaign materialises.\nThis is an opinion column.

{"title": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook predicts AR will be as big as iPhone", "content": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook predicts AR will be as big as iPhone\nChris Davies - Feb 12, 2017, 10:00 am CST\n1\nTim Cook has again voiced his enthusiasm for augmented reality, suggesting that the technology \u2013 which blends the real world with digital elements \u2013 could be as big as the iPhone. The Apple CEO has previously expressed his interest in AR, though Apple is yet to release a product based on the technology. However, with Microsoft, Google, and other big names all at different stages of augmented reality and virtual reality systems, it\u2019s widely considered a foregone conclusion that Apple will dive in too.\nWhen that happens, it\u2019s likely to be an AR system rather than VR one. Speaking to British newspaper The Independent, Cook outlined his reasoning for why augmenting the world around us makes more sense for Apple than replacing it with a digital environment completely. According to the CEO, that\u2019s because AR can still be sociable.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what\u2019s happening presently,\u201d Cook explained. As he sees it, one of AR\u2019s strengths is that it can be persistent but not dominate a user\u2019s attention. Instead it can simply \u201cbe a part of your world, of your conversation.\u201d\nRumors that Apple is working on some form of AR hardware have been circulating for several years. Back in early 2016, a roster of the team believed to be developing the Cupertino firm\u2019s system was detailed. Later in the year, a prototype form-factor similar to Google Glass was tipped, with a near-eye display that could beam information into the wearer\u2019s eye-line from a connected iPhone.\nListening to Cook, you wouldn\u2019t doubt Apple\u2019s intent. \u201cI regard [AR] as a big idea like the smartphone,\u201d he told the paper. :The smartphone is for everyone, we don\u2019t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it\u2019s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it\u2019s huge.\u201d\nInterestingly, Cook describes AR as \u201cnot a product per se\u201d but instead as \u201ca core technology.\u201d Apple has made previous acquisitions which will help piece together that technology, indeed. Back in 2015, the company bought Metaio , an augmented reality specialist which had developed a toolkit to make creating AR apps more straightforward.\nAll the same, if products like Glass have shown us anything, it\u2019s that it\u2019s easy to over-promise when it comes to new wearable technology. Despite Google\u2019s ambitious early demonstration videos, the reality of Glass proved to be fairly mundane; similarly, Microsoft\u2019s promo-reels for HoloLens initially led many to believe that the AR headset would completely flood the real world with a digital overlay. In actual fact, HoloLens\u2019 transparent displays only cover a fairly small portion of the wearer\u2019s total field-of-view. Most recently, secretive AR startup Magic Leap has faced controversy over claims it, too, oversold exactly what its so-far-unseen glasses are capable of.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-12T16:00:11Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Upcoming iPhone might get Qi wireless charging, as Apple joins WPC", "content": "Upcoming iPhone might get Qi wireless charging, as Apple joins WPC\nTweet\nOne of the things that the iPhone is missing compared to some of its main Android rivals is wireless charging support. While this may not sound like a major omission, many consumers nowadays -- especially buyers in this segment -- expect a modern smartphone to have\u00a0this technology. And\u00a0it looks like\u00a0Apple might\u00a0finally offer\u00a0it.\nIn what can only be considered as a big first step towards an iPhone with wireless charging support, Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), the group responsible for promoting the Qi standard that is prevalent in devices that offer wireless charging -- like the Samsung Galaxy S7.\nWhile this shouldn't be taken as a guarantee that the next iPhone will offer wireless charging support, Apple's\u00a0new status as a WPC member gives credence to rumors claiming this. But, fact of the matter is, it is still too early to tell what the company's intentions are and how this will affect the iPhone line.\nHaving the iPhone in mind, Apple could add wireless charging support either directly to its new smartphones or via\u00a0an accessory, like a battery case. The former approach makes sense for future iPhones, while the latter can be applied to both existing and new designs.\nOne of the main reasons why Apple did not add wireless charging support already to its iPhone line is the limitation in design that such a move would entail, as it drastically restricts the use of metal. Samsung, for instance, opted for\u00a0a glass back to offer it on the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7 lines.\nConsidering how much Apple likes metal nowadays, you can see why it did not rush to embrace wireless charging in the iPhone line -- its biggest moneymaker, by far. At the same time, it will be interesting to see how Apple will implement\u00a0this technology considering the above.\nPractically speaking, offering wireless charging support through an accessory makes the most sense, both financially and from a design point of view. Accessories mean more revenue and not having the internals required for wireless charging inside the iPhone can give the company more breathing room regarding the designs it can use in the future.\nApple did not make a formal announcement, but 9to5Mac says that the list of WPC members did not include the iPhone maker last week, so this is a very recent development. If that changes, you can expect an update with the additional details -- if there will be any, that is.\nAlso, as 9to5Mac notes, this is not a guarantee that the iPhone\u00a0will play nice with existing Qi chargers. The Apple Watch, for instance,\u00a0uses a different form of this wireless standard that's only compatible with the Apple-supplied\u00a0charger. The NFC chip in the iPhone is a similar affair, as it's not\u00a0meant to be used with anything other than Apple Pay.\nPersonally, I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple following a similar path when implementing wireless charging support in the iPhone, but, ultimately, we'll just have to wait and see what happens.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-13T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The report also continues to push the rumor that Apple is planning iris scanning technology in the next flagship iPhone.\nApple has requested its chip and component suppliers start trial production, inspection and prepare inventories for the new iPhone series earlier than usual, said the sources. Deliveries of chips and parts for the new models are expected to kick off in the second half of first-quarter 2017, the sources indicated.\nWhile earlier than usual production was separately reported earlier this week, a\u00a0Fast Company\u00a0piece two days ago cited an anonymous source in saying that the iPhone 8 will likely still launch around the usual September timeframe. It\u2019s possible Apple is ramping up production earlier to meet what is expected to be greater than usual demand without sacrificing quality.\nDigitimes\u00a0also cites industry sources in claiming Apple plans to introduce iris scanning and wireless charging in the new iPhone.\u00a0Fast Company specifically named Lumentum earlier this week as one firm supplying a new laser sensor for the upcoming iPhone which could be used for depth perception with Apple\u2019s new biometric security technology.\nWhile at least one model of the new iPhone is expected to retail for over $1000, KGI yesterday released an investor report pointing to a change in 3D Touch display technology that will be partly to blame for higher production costs. In that report, KGI predicts all three new iPhone models will include wireless charging technology, too, which has not yet been done on any iPhone.\nApple is also expected to introduce a new design later this year after the iPhone 7 largely iterated on the iPhone 6 look. An all-glass design with stainless steel borders could be the first to introduce an OLED display and stronger water resistance.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The current 4.7 inch iPhone\u00a07 has a 1960 mAH\u00a0battery whereas the Plus is rated at 2900 mAH.\nThat\u2019s an increase of about 50% for the OLED iPhone, if KGI\u2019s predictions turn out to be accurate.\u00a0Whilst some of this additional battery capacity\u00a0will be needed to power the larger screen, it\u00a0seems reasonable to expect the iPhone 8\u2019s battery life in usage to be higher overall.\nPrevious rumors about the industrial design of the OLED iPhone indicate that the larger screen will dominate the front of the phone, with almost no space wasted on surrounding\u00a0bezels or\u00a0borders. Some sources have indicated that the OLED panel will wrap around the sides of the device as well.\nKGI says the\u00a0dramatic increase in battery capacity is made possible by Apple adopting a stacked \u2018substrate-like\u2019 PCB mainboard. By making the board smaller, more\u00a0space inside the device is available for battery chemistry. This is shown by the larger\u00a0blue area in the diagram, provided by KGI research.\nThe rumored iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will use the new mainboard tech, but\u00a0they will not be stacked,\u00a0which means battery\u00a0capacity in those models will be roughly comparable to their iPhone 7 and 7 Plus\u00a0counterparts.\nMirroring what we\u2019ve heard before , the new stacked mainboard components are said to be significantly more expensive than\u00a0what has been previously used in an iPhone, with up to 80% higher manufacturing\u00a0costs. This again ties in to the idea that the premium iPhone 8 will have a premium price tag .\nAll three new iPhones, the two iterative models and the radically new OLED iPhone \u20188\u2019, are expected to be announced by Apple in the fall.\n\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-13T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "The $1,000 iPhone and other rumors about Apple\u2019s next smartphone", "content": "The $1,000 iPhone and other rumors about Apple\u2019s next smartphone\nFebruary 13, 2017\nThe Apple logo is displayed on the back of an iPhone. (Carl Court/Getty Images)\nIt may only be February, but it seems like people are already getting excited about the next iPhone, which is expected to debut\u00a0this fall.\u00a0Shares of Apple are trading\u00a0above their all-time high Monday, fueled in part by mounting speculation about the new\u00a0iPhone \u2014 which many expect will get a substantial makeover.\nMost people who follow these rumors expect three models of the iPhone: presumably an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus and an iPhone 8. What isn't so clear is whether those will be their actual names. After all, this is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so some people are expecting the \"iPhone 8\" to be called the \"iPhone X.\"\nBecause X's, as we all know, are cool.\nThis high-end version of the\u00a0iPhone is the one really generating the bulk of the excitement, as it's expected to be the one with the most design changes. Some more intriguing rumors about the actual specs of the phone\u00a0have surfaced in the past couple of weeks. Here's a look at what experts expect to see.\nA sharper screen: Previous spins through the rumor mill have raised expectations that at least the most expensive version of the iPhone will have an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen, rather than the\u00a0LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) technology it packs now.\nTranslated from alphabet soup, the biggest difference for consumers will be in the picture quality. OLED screens are known for having vivid colors and deep blacks.\nApple competitors \u2014 including Samsung, LG, Google and Motorola \u2014 have all released phones with this type of screen in the past. But Apple hasn't, which means that there's a good chunk of the smartphone market that may not know what they're missing \u2014 which makes the rumor about this display on the new iPhone all the more exciting.\nMany analysts also think that the firm will use a curved screen, similar to what we've seen on the Samsung Galaxy Edge. (Samsung, after all, is a screen supplier for Apple.) A display that wraps around the edge of the phone\u00a0gives you more screen to work with overall. That's a benefit for people who watch a lot of video on their phones.\u00a0Late last year, there were also reports that the phone would have a\u00a0 \"virtual button\" instead of a physical home button, making for an even smoother display.\nA very high price tag: Now this is a doozy. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities \u00a0predicted\u00a0the fanciest iPhone could bear a price tag of more than $1,000.\nIt's not quite as far-fetched as it may seem: a fully loaded iPhone 7 Plus, for example, already costs $969. Still, it's a psychological price line that many people may balk at, particularly when Apple's least expensive laptop is $999.\nWhy so pricey? Look no further than the rumor right above this one \u2014 that coveted OLED screen. Producing an OLED screen isn't easy, particularly when you're working on the kind of scale that Apple does. The question is whether the screen quality improvement will be enough to persuade people to dole out their cash.\nSet it down, charge it up: This has been a persistent item on the iPhone owner wishlist, particularly as Apple competitors such as Samsung have added it to their phones. This rumor went from wishful thinking late last year to likely, however, when\u00a0Kuo\u00a0said that the next generation of iPhones will have\u00a0wireless charging capabilities. Although, as 9 to 5 Mac reported , it's not clear whether the wireless charger itself\u00a0will be included with a new phone.\nApple already uses wireless charging for the Apple Watch, so it's not a huge leap of faith to think they could adapt their technology for the phone. The company last week also joined the Wireless Power Consortium , a standards body devoted to \u2014 well, you can probably guess, right? In a statement to Business Insider, the company said it's looking \"to participate and contribute ideas\" to the future thinking around wireless charging. But it declined to comment on the\u00a0report's speculation about future products.\nHayley Tsukayama Hayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post.

The iPhone 8\u00a0will likely debut in the fall with an OLED screen and Apple needs all the panels it can get\u00a0for its new flagship phone.\nThe iPhone 8 is expected to\u00a0distance itself from the iPhone 7 with a radical new all-glass design , an OLED screen between 5.2-5.8 inches, wireless charging . Rumors indicate the phone will have almost no bezels with the Touch ID home button somehow integrated into the screen.\nTry Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial\nIn 2016, Apple and Samsung had already agreed a 100 million unit deal . According to this latest report, the company has extended\u00a0its manufacturing agreement and now wants Samsung to provide 160 million panels. A timeframe for the delivery is not specified in the report, unfortunately.\nApple is expected to launch the (colloquially dubbed) iPhone 8 in the fall,\u00a0on the iPhone\u2019s usual yearly refresh cycle. However, anticipation for the new phone is higher than ever as\u00a0it is expected to be a major upgrade in both features and appearance, following three years of the same iPhone industrial design.\nWith supposedly no bezels on the front of the phone, the Touch ID Home Button will be integrated into the screen. Other details about Apple\u2019s 2017 phone remain unclear, like where the front-facing speaker will be relocated if it is true there is no top bezel.\u00a0Some reports have indicated that\u00a0as well being bezel-less, the OLED display may in fact wrap around the iPhone 8 curved sides similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge.\nThis wraparound means\u00a0that although the screen panel is 5.8 inches,\u00a0some of that area will\u00a0not be an\u00a0active touchscreen. Combined with the removal of bezels, the new iPhone 8 will be closer to the current 4.7 inch iPhone in physical size even with a substantial increase\u00a0in screen size.\nIn addition to the OLED iPhone 8, Apple is also reportedly introducing two\u00a0iterative phones as well. These devices will continue to use LCD displays and largely resemble the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus\u00a0aesthetically, featuring upgraded internal components and \u2014 maybe \u2014 wireless charging\u00a0capabilities.\nAs it seems the flagship OLED iPhone 8 will be priced upwards of $1000, it makes sense for Apple to introduce less-radical phones as well that can maintain the usual price points.\nRight now, Apple\u00a0uses OLED screens for the Apple Watch and MacBook Pro\u00a0Touch Bar .\u00a0The\u00a0sheer volume of iPhone sales will easily dwarf Apple\u2019s current demand for OLED, of course.\nWhen the iPhone 8 debuts\u00a0in the September 2017 timeframe,\u00a0it seems Samsung will be the sole supplier of the OLED screens. Apple\u00a0will reportedly be adding LG Display into the supply chain from next year, to diversify sourcing of the panels.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-13T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The magnetic charging adapter supplied with the Apple Watch will charge Qi devices (although the Watch itself is programmed not to work with just any Qi charger, only those supplied or approved by Apple) so membership may just be a delayed recognition of that usage.\nNine in 10 consumers want wireless charging on their next phone, according to Yussuff.

As spotted by 9to5mac, the website has recently been updated to feature Apple as one of the 213 members. This update fuels recent rumors that Apple is going to add wireless charging in the next iPhone.\nWhile wireless charging is nothing new, Apple has been very cautious about this feature. The Apple Watch already works with a magnetic cable that charges your\u00a0device wirelessly. But the iPhone has never had such a feature.\nWhen wireless charging first became popular, it was either slow or your phone battery would become hot. If this feature isn\u2019t implemented properly, it could damage batteries over the long haul. In addition to that technical challenge, companies were competing to set the standard. The technology is now ready for prime time, and Apple seems to be ready to move ahead.\nReliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities has already said that the next iPhone should feature wireless charging in addition to the good old Lightning port.\nIn September, Apple could introduce, not one, not two but three different iPhone models. In addition to the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (or whatever they call them), there should be a higher-end \u201cpro\u201d model.\nIt\u2019s unclear if all iPhones or just the top model will feature wireless charging. Similarly, nobody knows for sure if Apple is going to put the charger in the box or still ship the devices with a Lightning cable.\nThere are many, many companies in the Wireless Power Consortium, including Samsung, LG, Huawei, HTC and Qualcomm. So today\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t mean much about Apple\u2019s plans. And yet, it\u2019s hard to dismiss it when you combine it with the current rumors \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of smoke.\nNow, if only somebody could tell Apple that the Lightning port is kinda useful. If you blink, Apple could use this opportunity to remove that one last port on the iPhone.\nUpdate: Apple has provided the following statement:\nApple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members.\nUpdate #2: And the Wireless Power Consortium has sent me the following statement:\nThe companies with the largest market share in mobile phones are now members of the WPC and discussing the standardization of wireless charging.

The segment's appeal is undeniable: recognizable people singing recognizable songs in a recognizable situation.\nAnd now Apple is turning it into a series. To launch its foray into original programming.\nRelated Stories\nApple Music Is Releasing Frank Ocean\u2019s New Album on Friday\nYes, starting in April, Carpool Karaoke: The Series will be coming to an Apple Music subscription near you. After months of being tight-lipped about its plans for original content, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled the first trailer for the show last night at Recode's Code Media conference. He also announced that Apple will release another show this spring called Planet of the Apps. It stars Gwyneth Paltrow and will.i.am and kinda looks like Shark Tank\u2014but for apps. (It also just looks bad .)\nAgain, they're calling it original content.\nThis isn\u2019t Apple making a big play for original programming; this is Apple seasoning the steak you\u2019re already enjoying to see if you might like it. (The company did a similar dance when it partnered with Vice for The Score.) Cue admitted to this when he told the conference \u201cfour years from now, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to be in relation to this. We\u2019re trying different things. How fast it grows or where it goes remains to be seen.\u201d The goal of having original content may be to lure consumers to Apple Music, but the service already attracted 20 million users in 15 months. It doesn\u2019t have to race to grow its base.\nAnd with a show like Carpool Karaoke, it likely won\u2019t. The entire schtick of HOV-lane sing-alongs is perfect for YouTube. Outside of people who write about viral videos and insomniacs, though, very few people consider The Late Late Show appointment television (confession: I'm one of those people). Worse, they know that everything they\u2019ll need to see will be all over the internet the next morning. The chances that someone will plunk down $10 a month just to watch it are slim. The odds that they\u2019ll throw it on occasionally because they already have Apple Music, however, are much higher. (Can\u2019t say the same for Planet of the Apps, though, unless people accidentally click on it looking for Charlton Heston.)\nIt\u2019s not really that much different than the playbook of other streaming services. Netflix built a base delivering content from Hollywood studios until it had an audience ready to devour House of Cards. Hulu did the same, albeit doing it on TV networks' dime. Now Apple is hitting that playbook, capitalizing on the base it built through exclusivity windows from artists like Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper in order to own content. The surprising part about it is that Apple isn't making a splash, it's dipping a toe. If you\u2019re Apple and you want content, why not just buy a studio?\nCue disregarded that question at the Code Media conference, as well as comparisons to Netflix saying, \u201cwe\u2019re not out trying to buy a bunch of shows. ... We\u2019re trying things that are creative, that move culture.\u201d Whether putting Will Smith in a helicopter to sing R. Kelly\u2019s seminal \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\" qualifies as either is up for debate. Belting out shower songs with with Corden and friends is fun, but if Apple wants to attract new subscribers, the company is going to have to sing a different tune.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-14T22:02:08Z", "images": []}

It also disclosed a stake in Southwest Airlines Co. valued at about $2.2 billion as of Dec. 31.\nTaken together, the holdings represent one of the largest common stock investments for Buffett\u2019s company in years.\nBerkshire first disclosed that it had invested in airlines in November, which came as a surprise to some, because the billionaire previously criticized the business.\n\u201cThere has been massive consolidation in that industry,\" said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which oversees about $2.1 billion including Berkshire shares. Buffett likes investing in businesses that have a durable competitive advantage, Scherrer said, and \u201cit seems like airlines now offer that.\u201d\nAmerican climbed 2.5 percent in extended trading at 6:04 p.m. in New York, while Delta rose 1.8 percent. United advanced 1.6 percent, while Southwest increased 1.3 percent. Apple shares were little changed.\nParker\u2019s Presentation\nBerkshire\u2019s airline purchases were\ninfluenced , in part, by a presentation from American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker, according to people familiar with the matter\u00a0who asked not to be identified discussing Berkshire\u2019s strategy. Buffett said in November that Berkshire added Southwest shares after Sept. 30, without specifying how many.\nTuesday\u2019s filing also showed that Berkshire more than tripled its\nApple holding to about 57 million shares. The stake is now valued at more than $7 billion, making Berkshire among the top 10 holders of the Cupertino, California-based company.\nThe Monsanto stake was about 8 million shares and valued at more than $800 million. Bayer AG struck a $66 billion deal last year to take over the seed maker.\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming he sees the same thing we do, which is that there\u2019s a good likelihood the deal with Bayer will go through,\u201d Chris Shaw, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. in New York, said by phone.\nCash Hoard\nBuffett, 86, said last month that he\u2019d been\naccelerating stock purchases at Berkshire, which he\u2019s run for more than five decades. On Sept. 30, the company\u2019s cash hoard hit a\nrecord $84.8 billion . It had been climbing in recent quarters because of profit from Berkshire\u2019s dozens of subsidiaries and the\nSee also: Buffett bought stocks after U.S. election\nNot all the picks in the portfolio are Buffett\u2019s. In 2010, he brought on Todd Combs, a former hedge fund manager, to help him pick stocks. A year later, the billionaire hired another money manager, Ted Weschler. The filing doesn\u2019t show which person is responsible for each investment. In general, the deputies tend to make smaller investments than their boss.\nBuffett declined to discuss the rationale for the airline investments during an interview with Charlie Rose on Jan. 27, but he did say that the decision to buy was \u201cin large part\u201d his.\nWal-Mart, Deere\nThe billionaire further reduced his holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc., cutting it to less than 2 million shares as of Dec. 31. That compares with more than 60 million in 2014. Buffett has said online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. present an increasing threat to the big-box retailer.\nBerkshire exited stakes in Kinder Morgan Inc., NOW Inc. and Deere & Co. A rout in crop prices has left some farmers too cash-strapped to buy new tractors from the company. Deere slipped 0.7 percent in extended trading.\nBerkshire also reported owning about 167 million shares of Sirius XM Holdings Inc., valued at about $740 million at the end of 2016. The satellite radio provider is controlled by billionaire John Malone.\nShares of Sirius jumped about 3 percent in extended trading, while climbed 1 percent.\nEven as Berkshire\u2019s stock picks are closely watched by investors, they\u2019ve become less important to the company\u2019s overall performance. During the past two decades, Buffett has focused more on acquisitions than picking stocks.\nBerkshire\u2019s dozens of subsidiaries include auto insurer Geico, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and railroad\nBNSF .

The company has revealed the first trailer for its upcoming non-scripted reality TV show called \u2018Planet of the Apps\u2019 at Recode\u2019s Code Media conference. Based on the trailer, it looks a lot like Shark Tank with a vibe that reminds me of The Voice.\nThe show will feature four celebrities turned judges \u2014 Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Will.i.am and Gary Vaynerchuk. VC firm Lightspeed Venture will also play a big role as they could end up investing in the best teams.\nBased on the trailer, tech companies like Yelp and Uber are also going to help the teams with some guidance. The winners will also get promotion on the App Store homepage.\nThe show will air on Apple Music at some point in the future. Apple is going to release one episode per week instead of dropping all the episodes at once.\nBut the best part of the trailer is the escalator pitch (sic). Teams have 60 seconds to convince the judges. In real life, short pitches are often called elevator pitches because you can pitch your company during an elevator ride.\nProduction company Propagate probably took it too literally and tried recreating the good old elevator pitch. But an elevator isn\u2019t really practical for a TV show, so they replaced it with an escalator. Tada! Let\u2019s do an escalator pitch!\nI\u2019m going to be honest \u2014 despite this escalator pitch, this trailer is looking quite good and I can\u2019t wait to see the actual show.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-14T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "The Best Encrypted Chat App Now Does Video Calls Too", "content": "The Best Encrypted Chat App Now Does Video Calls Too\nOpen Whisper Systems\nEven as the encryption app Signal became the go-to private communications channel for activists, journalists, politicians , and more, its encrypted calling feature remained less than perfect. It lacks video, often drops calls, and doesn't always integrate with your phone's existing features. A Signal update gradually rolling out now upgrades the calling features and adds video, too\u2014but might require its most privacy-sensitive users to take an extra step to protect themselves.\nOn Tuesday, Signal's creators at the non-profit Open Whisper Systems announced a beta version of the update that, in addition to video calling, adds the ability to answer calls from a locked screen, and what they promise will be better call quality. For now, anyone who receives the update can choose activate those new features in the \"advanced\" menu under Signal's settings. \"We want Signal to be a joy to use,\" says Moxie Marlinspike, Open Whisper Systems' founder. \"We\u2019re constantly focused on continuing to refine it and add features and functionality that we think people will love.\"\nOpen Whisper Systems\nBut anyone testing the beta who links their iPhone to iCloud and wants the same level of privacy Signal has always offered should consider an extra step, too: Disabling a setting that uploads a call's metadata to Apple. The beta upgrade to Signal will use CallKit, Apple's framework for allowing VoIP calls like Signal's, to be integrated more completely into the calling functionality of the phone. But that also means calls will be recorded in the iPhone's call log and, for iCloud users, shared with Apple's server. \"iOS treats CallKit calls like any other call, however that also means some information will be synced to iCloud if enabled,\" Open Whisper Systems warns. \"This information includes who you called and how long you talked.\"\nFor anyone who cringes at the thought of leaking that metadata, however, the new Signal beta will let you turn CallKit integration off on the same \"Advanced\" menu in the app's settings. CallKit integration will only be used if it's enabled on both ends of the call\u2014if you disable it, your metadata won't be leaked by your contact's phone, either. And Open Whisper Systems is still considering whether the version of Signal it pushes out after this beta will integrate CallKit by default, or as an opt-in feature.\n\"How we handle CallKit once this is the default experience isn\u2019t entirely resolved,\" Marlinspike says. He suggests that the app could mere display \"Signal users\" in the iPhone's call log to protect users' identities, or Signal may walk users through its settings when once installed, to help people choose their privacy preferences. \"There are a bunch of things we can do other than just having it on by default.\"\nSignal News\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-14T18:55:08Z", "images": []}

In fact, Ming-Chi Kuo states that the lower portion of the display will be set aside as a \"function area,\" perhaps alluding to some sort of virtual buttons or finger sensing situated there. The analyst is mum as to how exactly will that navigation or sensing space at the bottom be organized, and whether it can transform into a regular screen area while watching movies, browsing, gaming or other activities.\nHis schematics, however, jibe with numerous reports that Apple will be doing away with the Touch ID button on the OLED iPhone 8 , while it will be kept on the \"regular\" iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, or whatever Apple names the whole set. The company might, however, implement other biometric solutions like iris or face scanning technology. The moral of the whole iPhone-with-flexible-OLED story is that Apple will eventually be able to fit a high-res 5\"+ panel in a chassis that is about the size of the current iPhone 7 , and we can't wait to see how would that puppy look in practice.\u00a0\nThis latest memo from\u00a0Ming-Chi Kuo, however, does explain why we have such conflicting reports about the future iPhone 8 screen size, ranging from 5 inches through 5.2 inches , and then all the way up to 5.8\" . Naughty flexible displays, always confusing people. Last but not least, the reputed analyst reiterates the prediction that the iPhone 8 will land with a $1000 starting tag , which is not hard to fathom, given that the cost of producing it will be 50%-60% higher than that of the regular models. After all, we calculated that just the flexible OLED panels that Apple has reportedly ordered from Samsung , will cost $70 apiece , as opposed to less than $40 on the current iPhone 7. The Galaxy S8 and LG G6 are also said to come with higher tags than their predecessors , but that's apparently the price to pay for the \" all-screen ,\" \" bezel-less \" trend in 2017.\n", "language": "en", "date": null, "images": []}

That may mean wired charging could be missing completely on the next iPhone, said Rob Rueckert, the managing director at Sorenson Capital, a private equity and venture capital firm.\n\"They forced users into a different model with the wireless Earbuds [AirPods],\" Rueckert said. \"If you buy an iPhone 8, or whatever future versions they have, are they going to take it to the point where they only allow wireless charging?\"\nCreative Commons Lic.\nApple's AirPods, which use wireless Bluetooth to connect to a mobile device, ushered in iPhones without analog audio ports.\nWhile the WPC's version of magnetic resonance wireless charging requires a mobile device to be in direct contact with a pad, it's unlikely Apple would move in that direction and keep a hardwired charging cord.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\nThe problem with allowing both wired and wireless charging, Rueckert said, is there's no benefit of one over the other; why would users pay for a separate wireless charging pad when the device still requires a wire to be plugged into an electrical outlet?\n\"If they still allow you to plug it in, users will have to decide if they want to buy the expensive charger -- a feature I don't find overly compelling,\" Rueckert said.\nPlus, magnetic wireless charging requires an additional element in the mobile device: a copper receiving coil, which takes up valuable real estate inside the ever-thinner iPhone.\nRueckert believes if Apple does choose to roll out wireless charging with the next iPhone, it'll likely go all in.\n\"They've done it before. They've been bold movers in changing features, and because of the loyalty to the Apple brand, people will embrace it; it wouldn't surprise me,\" Ruekert said.\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of wireless charging technologies the industry is pursuing: charging pads that typically use magnetic inductive or resonance technology, which Samsung has adopted in its devices; charging bowls or through-surface type chargers, which can charge from a few centimeters away and also use magnetic resonance charging technology; and WiFi-like wireless charging, which is typically known as uncoupled. It produces less charging power but has a longer range allowing users to move freely while a device powers up.\n(Apple, according to MacRumors, has also been eyeing\u00a0 WiTricity , which licenses a magnetic resonance charging technology.)\nWhile systems being demonstrated by companies like Energous and Ossia, according to Green use Wi-Fi-like charging, the new Dell/WiTricity tablet system announced at CES uses the the AirFuel Resonant specification; it works with charging bowls and through-surface charging, according to David Green, research manager for the Wireless Power & Smart Utilities Infrastructure Group at IHS.\n\"In terms of progress and industry readiness, charging pads have been shipping in volume since 2015, charging bowls/through-surface type are really just launching this year, and charging across a room is probably still at least a year away from commercial high-volume reality,\" he said.\nEnergous\nAn illustration of how Enerous' WattUp ecosystem works. A Far Field transmitter \u00a0embedded in the bezel of a TV or sound bar or mounted on the wall or ceiling, enables \u00a0meshed-network coverage where linked transmitters cover larger spaces.\nOne thing is clear, Green continued, in 2017 users are not going to see \"a device offering full-speed wireless charging across a room.\"\nEven if Apple chooses magnetic resonance wireless charging for the iPhone, it will likely be a \"baby step\" toward an eventual changeover to the Holy Grail of wireless charging: charging over distance with a W-iFi-like connection.\nOssia and Energous have demonstrated wireless charging beyond 15 feet.\n\"I've used both. The technology works,\" Ruekert said.\nBoth Energous' WattUp and Ossia's Cota mobile device charging systems work much like a wireless router, sending radio frequency signals that can be received by enabled mobile devices, such as wearables and mobile phones. A small RF antenna in the form of PCB board, an ASIC and software make up the wireless power receivers.\nOssia\nOssia's wireless RF charging router.\nAnother advantage of using radio frequencies to charge a mobile device is that a traditional magnetic charging coil is no longer needed. A mobile device's Wi-Fi receiver chip can simply be modified so that it receives both the wireless signal for communication and charging.\nWhatever wireless charging method Apple chooses, if indeed it does so this year, there will likely be something proprietary added to it, Ruekert said.\nOver the last decade, Apple has filed several patents on wireless charging.\nIn 2005, an Apple patent described technology for an iPod using zero-contact induction for not only charging but data transfer -- most likely to manage device charging.\nApple\nThe Apple Watch, launched in 2015, uses a proprietary form of\u00a0 inductive wireless charging.\nIn a 2012 Apple patent filing, the company described a near field magnetic resonance (NFMR) power supply \"arranged to wirelessly provide power to any of a number of suitably configured devices.\"\nApple's patent description indicated a charging distance of about one meter, which could be projected out from a desktop computer such as the iMac to power peripheral devices such as a wireless mouse.\nWhile \"second guessing exact Apple product specifications is a fool's game,\" wireless charging is quickly on the uptake by most leading mobile technology providers, Green said.\nIn 2016, 200 million wireless charging-enabled devices shipped, with almost all of them using some form of inductive (charging pad) type design, Green said.\n\"If this was any other manufacturer, you would predict inductive charging pad-type technology as the start point,\" Green said. \"But I wouldn't be surprised if they're looking at more than one method of wireless charging as part of the overall experience.\"\nThis story, \"Apple may cut the (charging) cord completely with the iPhone 8\" was originally published by Computerworld\n.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-17T08:01:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Latest report suggests iPhone 8 screen features higher 521 PPI density, 3x Retina scaling like Plus models", "content": "Latest report suggests iPhone 8 screen features higher 521 PPI density, 3x Retina scaling like Plus models\nReddit\nLast night, reliable Apple analyst KGI\u2019s Ming-Chi Kuo posted his latest assessment of the iPhone 8 detailing the addition of a\u00a0virtual function area \u00a0replacing the physical Home button. However, the report also included\u00a0screen resolution specs\u00a0which help\u00a0draw some additional insight.\nKGI\u2019s numbers\u00a0imply that\u00a0the iPhone 8 will have a pixel density around 521 PPI, far higher than the existing\u00a0iPhone lineup (iPhone 7 PPI is ~320). It also seems likely that Apple will use Retina assets at 3x scale, packing Plus features into a body the same size as the 4.7 inch phones \u2026\nTry Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial\nThe report says that the\u00a0area of the screen dedicated to the app content and home screen\u00a0has a resolution of\u00a02436\u00d71125. The current iPhone 7 has a screen resolution of 1334\u00d7750.\nOn a raw pixel count basis, this means the iPhone 8 main screen resolution is\u00a0almost twice that of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and\u00a0iPhone 7. Taking KGI\u2019s metrics that this screen region will measure at 5.15 inches, this works out to a pixels-per-inch measurement of 512.\nIf\u00a0the numbers\u00a0turn out to be\u00a0accurate, the iPhone 8 would\u00a0tout a pixel density greater than both\u00a0the\u00a04.7-inch and\u00a05.5-inch iPhones, which have 325 PPI and 401 PPI, respectively.\u00a0This will be welcome news for Android users looking to switch to iPhone, who have complained at the\u00a04.7-inch iPhone\u2019s low-resolution display\u00a0relative to\u00a0other smartphones on the market.\nGoing further, we can\u00a0estimate that Apple\u00a0will utilize this high-density screen at 3x Retina scaling.\u00a0Why? The current non-Plus iPhone uses 2x scaling which means app render at 667x375 points.\nFor the rumored iPhone 8 specs, a 2x scaling would be nonsensical (a\u00a01218\u00d7562 res would likely mean UI elements are far too small for comfortable interaction).\u00a0At 3x, the numbers\u00a0fit a lot better.\nAt 3x, the iPhone 8 main screen canvas would be equal to\u00a0812x375 points.\u00a0Coincidentally (or more likely planned to be this way),\u00a0the 375 point vertical\u00a0resolution is identical to the current iPhone 7.\u00a0This means\u00a0application design\u00a0on iPhone 8 will\u00a0be roughly similar to that of the current 4.7-inch iPhone series, except with an additional 145 points worth of height to play with.\nThe physical size of the UI would be\u00a0a tad larger (the screen is bigger after all) but\u00a0a\u00a0single line of text will take up the same\u00a0amount of horizontal space. Vertically scrolling content would be able to show more rows at a time, however. Unfortunately, these dimensions mean that\u00a0the next iPhone would no longer have a 16:9 aspect ratio screen. Instead, the ratio would be closer\u00a0to 21:9 which could be a drawback of the new design when watching video content like YouTube or downloaded\u00a0TV shows without letterboxing. You can\u00a0get a sense of how narrow/tall this is by looking at the\u00a0diagram, left.\nFor the function area,\u00a0the report\u2019s\u00a0metrics suggest that\u00a0region will be about 290\u00a0pixels tall. To help visualize it, that\u2019s\u00a0approximately\u00a0equal to the\u00a04.7-inch static icon\u00a0dock on the Home Screen.\u00a0The report does not elaborate on how Apple plans to utilize that space, although we can assume some form of\u00a0virtual Home button icon will be shown in the middle.\nAll of these claims are not certainties;\u00a0KGI\u2019s numbers could be incorrect for a start although the analyst does have a pretty good track record. It is also possible that Apple may offer\u00a0multiple Display Zoom\u00a0modes\u00a0which switch between 2x and 3x rendered canvases.\nKGI\u2019s predictions are also not fully explained; he says that the 5.8-inch display has a native resolution of 2800\u00d71242 but the display area for content is 2436\u00d71125. The 117px difference in the horizontal\u00a0dimension is not accounted for which leaves some hanging question marks.\nThat being said, the iPhone 8\u00a0is looking to be a massive upgrade. As well as the radical new design with an almost bezel-less front, the\u00a0PPI is looking to be a\u00a0significant upgrade over what Apple offers in the lineup today.\u00a0Other iPhone 8 rumors include the addition of wireless charging , better water resistance , and some form of face recognition biometrics . Apple is expected to\u00a0officially unveil the new phone at a media event in the fall.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-16T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The implication was that February's security fixes would ship as soon as that \"last-minute issue\" was resolved.\nBut in a Wednesday revision to the original announcement, Microsoft said, \"We will deliver updates as part of the planned March Update Tuesday, March 14, 2017.\" (Microsoft prefers the label \"Update Tuesday\" to the more universal \"Patch Tuesday.\")\nSkipping a month's update slate was unprecedented. Although Microsoft has not issued updates on four Patch Tuesdays since the 2003 debut of regularly-scheduled updates -- most recently in March 2007 -- those were instances when no patches had been prepared. It has never missed a month when there were clearly fixes prepped and ready to go.\n\"This isn't like before when no updates meant nothing was ready,\" said Susan Bradley, the moderator of the PatchMangement.org mailing list, where business IT administrators discuss update tradecraft. \"Patches were ready. They just -- for whatever unknown reason -- couldn't be delivered.\" Bradley also writes about Microsoft's patching processes for the Windows Secrets newsletter .\n[ Got a spare hour? Take this online course and learn how to install and configure Windows 10 with the options you need. ]\nMicrosoft has not said what prompted the delay, or what triggered the expansion of that into the month's cancelation.\nWithout a declaration from the Redmond, Wash. company, speculation about the cause has been rife. Some believed that a single faulty patch had shelved them all, but that made little sense , Goettl said Wednesday when he pointed out that Office patches are delivered separately from those addressing vulnerabilities in Windows. If a single patch for Windows held back the Windows cumulative update, the Office update should have remained viable.\nTwo days ago, Goettl argued that the extent of the cancelation -- all updates -- hinted at problems with the company's update service infrastructure. In an interview today, he stuck by his guns. \"This is something bigger than a single patch,\" Goettl said, \"something with Windows Update or the update replication process.\"\nBradley decried the lack of information from Microsoft, which, she said, only fueled conjecture, including her own. \"My gut tells me something was up with the [update] publishing engine, [but] again merely speculation,\" she said.\nThe experts agreed that the cancelation of February's updates will affect Windows customers, but not on the extent of the disruption. \"I think there will be minor disruptions, along the lines of needing to re-plan [for deploying the updates] for next month,\" said Goettl when asked how the missing month would affect IT administrators.\n\"Is it [having an impact?] I'd say yes, it is, given the vibe I'm getting from my peers,\" Bradley said.\nWithout February's patches, security researchers have said, some unprotected systems may be compromised by exploits of now-known vulnerabilities .\nAgreeing, Bradley ticked off several obvious ones. \"We now have a potentially ticking time bomb on our hands as we're not expected to get [this month's Adobe] Flash update on our Windows 8 and Windows 10 [PCs] until March,\" she said. \"We have a SMB zero-day denial of service [vulnerability] we now need to investigate mediations for.\"\nThe latter Windows vulnerability went public Feb. 2; a patch was anticipated in the now-canceled batch that was to ship Tuesday.\nAnd come March, there's a chance that the increased size and complexity -- two months' worth of fixes rather than one -- could toss a wrench into the works. \"The [update], when it arrives, at least for the pre-Windows 10 versions, may have twice as much change in it, and most likely, twice as much a chance of breaking something,\" contended Goettl.\nFor all the complaints from patch professionals like Goettl and Bradley, as well as IT administrators and Windows users in general, the snafu -- whatever its cause -- will not change Microsoft's fortunes or in a material way, even its reputation.\n\"We have no choice to accept [how things are] if we are running Windows,\" said Bradley, voicing the reality in business. But that doesn't mean customers have to like it.\n\"If they don't have a Plan B, we don't have one either,\" Bradley said.\nThis story, \"Microsoft's decision to scrap February security updates unnerves patch experts\" was originally published by Computerworld\n.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-17T18:26:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "HTC to Exit Entry-Level Phone Market Later This Year", "content": "HTC to Exit Entry-Level Phone Market Later This Year\nby Ryan Smith on February 17, 2017 5:30 PM EST\nPosted in\nComment\nIn the highly competitive smartphone industry it\u2019s easy enough to make a name for yourself, but it\u2019s a lot harder to make a profit while doing so. Apple and Samsung have long captured the lion\u2019s share of the profits thanks to their flagship smartphones, which has forced the other handset vendors to fight for their own market share and profits. Due to the success of the duo, rival vendors have been focusing on an area where those companies are not as entrenched in (or not present at all in): the entry-level phone market. This is the traditional volume play, and while it can be profitable on the whole, the razor-thin margins and heavy competition from other vendors make it a similarly tough environment. And now it looks like there will be one less vendor competing in that market, as HTC has let it known that they will be exiting the market for entry-level phones.\nEarlier this week in the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call, in a bit of a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it moment that the crew over at Phone Scoop picked up on, HTC announced that they would be leaving the entry-level phone market over the year in order to focus on more profitable segments of the smartphone market. Undertaking what amounts to a gradual draw-down, HTC is not discontinuing any phones or discontinuing support for those phones, but they will no longer be developing phones for the entry-level segment. Which means that when phones like the Desire 10 series reach the end of their natural retail lifetime, HTC will not be replacing them with newer models.\nHTC\u2019s struggles with profitability over the years are well known. While the company is and continues to be a major player in the smartphone market, they have been squeezed on all fronts; Apple and Samsung split the bulk of the high-end market, and meanwhile the company faces extremely stiff competition at the entry-level from Chinese OEMs, whom are very difficult to compete with on price. As a result, rather than trying to make the volume play work with the entry-level market, HTC has decided to focus on the more profitable mid-range and high-end markets.\nThe challenge now for HTC will be clawing market share from Samsung and other vendors in those more profitable spaces. While the mid-range and high-end markets are easier to make a profit in \u2013 consumers aren\u2019t so price sensitive and there\u2019s more to a phone\u2019s price than just its bill of materials \u2013 it\u2019s still a difficult task since vendors still need to move phones in some volume in order to cover the R&D costs of these better phones. The good news for HTC is that the company appears to be on the right path in terms of handset design after the HTC 10 , but and the end of the day they still need to overcome consumer inertia and convince potential customers to leave Apple/Samsung.\nFinally, HTC\u2019s exit of the entry-level market means that the company expects to introduce \u201csix or seven\u201d new phones for 2017. We\u2019ve already seen their first two phones with the HTC U Play and HTC U Ultra , which were introduced at CES and will be aimed at the mid-range and high-end markets respectively, and these will be joined by other phones throughout the rest of the year. \u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-17T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "I've used AirPods for the last month  --  here's what Apple should do with its next pair", "content": "The Apple AirPods.\nApple\u2019s AirPods are fine.\nThey\u2019re lightweight, they\u2019re remarkably easy to pair with an iPhone, and they\u2019re one of two truly wireless earphones I\u2019ve used that can hold a Bluetooth connection without totally freaking out.\nThey work.\nYou\u2019d be surprised at how few wireless headphones you can say that about.\nStill, I\u2019d have a hard time recommending them to non-tech-enthusiasts. Though the AirPods are better than most of their fully wireless peers, they can\u2019t totally escape feeling like a test run.\nMost of the deepest flaws should improve over time \u2014 forthcoming Bluetooth updates should bolster battery life and smooth out what connection issues are left. And while Siri is\u00a0bad , it\u2019s a larger project that Apple\u00a0has plenty of incentive to improve.\nThere are other, more design-centric issues, though, that Apple can\u00a0address\u00a0if it wants the AirPods to be a more polished, consumer-friendly product.\nHere\u2019s a few I\u2019d like to see in the future.\nNew colours, or anything else to make them look less goofy\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nThe AirPods' biggest problem isn't the mediocre sound, or how the fit isn't great for some, or Bluetooth's ongoing imperfections -- it's that you look like a goof while wearing them. You are not the cool dancing guy in Apple's commercials.\nThere are many interesting ideas and technical accomplishments to the AirPods, and tech enthusiasts have rightly praised Apple for them. But the stares they generate, and the ensuing discomfort you feel, are real, and they shouldn't be discounted. It's not a Google-Glass-level problem , but it's not not that either.\nThe reason this is a big deal is because it's not clear how Apple can mitigate it with the current AirPods design. The Bragi Headphone and Jabra Elite Sport don't look normal, but they don't have a bright white stem hanging off them. That stem, however, is a big part of what lets the AirPods work.\nApple seems to be hoping its sheer popularity will normalize the design, and given the AirPods' apparent fast start , it might've bet wisely. But if sales don't hold up beyond the early adopters, and a non-stem design is out of the question, maybe some more subdued colour options would help. A black pair might not call as much attention to itself.\nA bigger battery case\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nOn their own, the AirPods last around 4-5 hours per charge. That's not the best -- the aforementioned Bragi Headphone can last closer to 6 hours -- and it's not good, but it's enough for a day's commute.\nAs noted above, forthcoming Bluetooth updates should help truly wireless earbuds last longer, so there shouldn't be much need to bulk up the AirPods just to fit a bigger battery. What can afford to bulk up, though, is the little white case that holds and recharges them. You get between 2 or 3 recharges with what's available now -- it's entirely possible to strengthen that while keeping the whole thing pocketable.\nA lost AirPod tracker\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nIt's ultimately on you not to lose your stuff, but something as small and slippery as the AirPods is easier to drop and lose than most other gadgets. Forking over another $69 to replace one isn't too nice.\nApple has a well-known 'Find My iPhone' app today, and a similar solution would be a good safeguard here. There was an app along these lines, but Apple quietly removed it shortly after it was picked up by the press. If Apple doesn't plan on making its own alternative, giving users no recourse to find a device that's easy to lose isn't the best look.\nNoise cancellation\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nIt'd probably result in a price hike -- or, more likely, some sort of 'premium' model -- but the AirPods' unsealed design lets in a good chunk of noise if you don't crank the volume all the way up.

{"title": "Apple assembling devices in India won\u2019t mean cheaper iPhones yet", "content": "India\u2019s Economic Times today reported that Apple will begin assembling the iPhone SE in the coming months in Karnataka, adding more detail to comments from the state\u2019s minister of IT earlier this month that seemingly confirmed an arrangement.\nApple currently prices the iPhone higher in India than any other country in the world. It is widely assumed that the cost is\u00a0down to high import taxes that the company is subject to \u2014 since it manufacturers devices in China \u2014 and so it figures that any move to assemble devices locally could reduce the price of iPhones in India. That\u2019s important, because Apple continues to struggle to gain any meaningful share of India\u2019s smartphone market, which is one of the few tipped to grow consistently.\nA recent IDC report found that Chinese smartphone brands dominated India\u2019s phone market in the final quarter of 2016, with no Indian brands in the top five for the first time. Apple, meanwhile, had its best year of sales in India \u2014 selling 2.5 million units \u2014 but that represents a tiny fraction of overall sales \u2014 more than 28 million devices shipped in Q4 2016 alone.\nBut for those thinking local manufacturing will\u00a0instantly fix Apple\u2019s issues, the case is not so clear.\n\u201cApple is not known to abruptly drop prices and thus the saving could go towards building foundation for Apple\u2019s retail and marketing footprint,\u201d Counterpoint Research analyst Neil Shah told TechCrunch, pointing out that right now the U.S. firm has no independent retail presence in India.\n\u201cApple though selectively offers discount only during festive season and that could be also 4-5 percent [price cuts]\u00a0max and not the entire 12-13 percent [saving from local production] will be passed on to consumers.\u201d\nShah also explained that Apple\u2019s initial efforts \u201cwon\u2019t be full-fledged manufacturing like in Taiwan or China,\u201d while he estimates that no more than 400,000 units per quarter would be assembled initially, minimizing any potential impact.\nOf course, that\u2019s the short-term prognosis, and if Apple is able to scale its India productions \u2014 and potentially advance the processes they carry out \u2014 then there\u2019s scope for price savings to be passed on. For now, this is a promising development for Apple and its fans in India \u2014 but it is likely to be\u00a0some time before the full impact is felt in the market.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-17T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Logic Pros: Using MacBook Pro\u2019s Touch Bar w/ customizable key command shortcuts", "content": "Reddit\nWith Logic Pro X 10.3 ,\u00a0Apple introduced support for the new MacBook Pro\u2019s Touch Bar, the small touchscreen panel that debuted on the device last fall. Logic users might have had to wait longer than Final Cut Pro or even GarageBand users as one of Apple\u2019s main apps that didn\u2019t get support right at launch, but what it did end up getting is some of the best Touch Bar support yet. Let\u2019s take a look.\nThe best 4K & 5K displays for Mac\nThe Touch Bar in Logic works a lot like you might expect if you\u2019ve used it with other Apple apps. It borrows some of the features that first launched in GarageBand and Final Cut Pro, for instance, with an overview of the timeline\u00a0and some buttons for making quick adjustments of various settings for the selected track. But it also includes fully customizable buttons that can be assigned to keyboard shortcuts!\nHow does it work?\nA small icon to the left of the Touch Bar gives access to four main functions:\nSmart Controls\nTimeline Overview\u00a0(an overview of the Tracks Area timeline)\nKey Commands (Customizable banks of keyboard\u00a0shortcut buttons)\nSoftware\u00a0Instrument/Track Controls (a virtual keyboard, drum kits, or audio track settings, and that small keyboard icon will change accordingly)\nSmart Controls\nLike GarageBand, the Touch Bar\u00a0lets you control Logic\u2019s Smart Controls, a feature that presents users with onscreen controls to quickly adjust various settings for software\u00a0instruments and effects:\nThese will change depending on what track you have selected, and clicking on one of the Smart Controls lets you drill into make an adjustment right on the Touch Bar itself (as pictured above for Level). So if you had an audio track loaded with some guitar FX or a software instrument like a keyboard or synth, you\u2019d get options that look something like the above based on the instrument and plug-ins loaded.\nTimeline\u00a0Overview\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll get a timeline overview\u00a0by default that, like Final Cut Pro and other apps, gives an overview of Logic\u2019s Tracks Area allowing you to see all the regions of your tracks even beyond what\u2019s visible on your Mac\u2019s display (a white box around regions on the Touch Bar represents what\u2019s currently visible on your timeline on your Mac). That might be handy for a quick reference of where you are in your timeline if you happen to forget, but otherwise you won\u2019t be able to see much detail vertically along the workspace, especially in a session with a lot of tracks.\nBut the real benefit is that you can use your finger to quickly scrub through the timeline, which is especially nice for long sessions and I find better than the traditional alternatives.\nKey Commands (aka Customizable Touch Bar shortcuts)\nBut most notably, Logic Pro is the first app I\u2019ve seen that lets users set up fully customizable Touch Bar buttons by assigning keyboard shortcuts\u2026\nLike many pro apps, Logic users like myself use a ton of keyboard shortcuts. Logic gives you 16\u00a0banks of fully customizable Touch Bar buttons for these, with 8 buttons per bank, giving you 128 total customizable buttons.\u00a0The 16\u00a0banks work by tapping into Logic\u2019s Key Commands editor where you set normal keyboard shortcuts with modifier keys.\u00a0So anything you have as a keyboard shortcut can now become a button on the Touch Bar\u2026\nYour usual modifier keys act as banks of commands on the Touch Bar. By default, Logic Pro has 5 banks already assigned that are enabled with no modifier,\u00a0command, option, control and shift. For those Apple has set up transport controls and some commonly used tools and functions\u00a0on the others:\nBut you have 16\u00a0banks in total including all the possible combinations of the modifiers together\u2013CMD + Option, etc\u2013 each with 8 buttons to assign. A handful of the possibilities are pictured below:\nLogic Pro not only lets you customize the 16 banks of 8 buttons, they are also contextually sensitive based on what window or editor you happen to be in. This works the same way it does for keyboard shortcuts in the Key Commands editor (pictured below), which is where you set up the Touch Bar-specific commands.\u00a0\nFor example, if you setup the same command to work in different windows (like Logic\u2019s Workspace or Mixer), it will automatically switch accordingly on the Touch Bar too depending on what window is active/selected. The key commands list is organized by these, with categories for Global Commands, and the various windows and editors that commands can be assigned to.\nAnd just like other keyboard shortcuts, you can \u201cLearn\u201d commands for Touch Bar within the Key Commands editor, enabling you to quickly assign a custom Touch Bar button. Select a command, hit \u201cLearn Touch Bar\u201d, and tap the Touch Bar button you want to assign, with or without modifiers. You can also set custom text (and emoji) and colors for the buttons here.\nTo get to the key commands editor and customize the default shortcut buttons on Touch Bar, Navigate to Logic Pro X>Key Commands>Edit\u2026 or hit Option + K on your keyboard.\u00a0\nSoftware\u00a0Instrument/Track Controls\nThe Software Instrument/Track controls mode\u00a0will pull up virtual keyboard, drum pads, or controls for your audio track channel strip, automatically changing depending on what track you have selected. And the icon for the software\u00a0instrument/track controls mode will change accordingly:\nYou\u2019ll get a\u00a0keyboard for software instruments like pianos and synths with a scale mode that isn\u2019t unlike what you get in GarageBand on iOS. And Drum pads with icons for Drummer tracks and virtual drum kits with Note Repeat and Velocity controls:\nAnd if you have an audio track selected, Touch Bar will instead serve you up controls for\u00a0your gain, level, inputs, Record enable, and more:\nOutside of the four main functions, there are also contextual buttons that will appear (for example for a save dialog or other pop-up). But the real star of the show here is Logic\u2019s implementation of customizable keyboard shortcut buttons that I hope other apps adopt.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-19T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Why is Apple hyping augmented reality?", "content": "Why is Apple hyping augmented reality?\nWhy is Apple hyping augmented reality?\nApple CEO Tim Cook is again using his bully pulpit to hype augmented reality and tease the company\u2019s plans. What\u2019s got Cook so fired up about AR?\nMatt Kapko (CIO (US)) 17 February, 2017 05:11\n-\nComments\nAugmented reality has a powerful ally, and apparently ardent supporter, in Apple CEO Tim Cook. The leader of the most valuable publicly traded company in the world reiterated his optimistic outlook for the future of augmented reality (AR) and highlighted the technology\u2019s capability to layer improvements in the physical world.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality, which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but allows an improvement on what\u2019s happening presently,\u201d he told The Independent in a recent interview. \u201cMost people don\u2019t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can\u2019t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.\u201d\nCook compares AR to smartphones\nCook, who is secretive about Apple\u2019s future plans, has hyped up AR multiple times during the last year and there are other hints, such as job postings, that indicate Apple is investing in AR and at least developing product prototypes. Whether Apple eventually releases an AR product or not is another matter, but it certainly seems to be in the cards based on Cook\u2019s latest comments.\n[ Related: Tim Cook: Augmented reality is the future, and fake news is ruining everything ]\n\u201cI regard it as a big idea like the smartphone,\u201d Cook said. He adds AR will be just as attractive on a global scale, similar to how the iPhone crosses divides in culture, socioeconomics and business functions. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it\u2019s not a product per se, it\u2019s a core technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that\u2019s why I get so excited about it.\u201d\nBrian Blau, research vice president at Gartner , says he also believes AR will be a \u201cvery powerful technology, but it will take years before we see significant uptake.\u201d While AR and virtual reality (VR) share many similarities, a form factor that mixes the real world with virtual layers is a \u201cmore compelling, interactive scenario than you find with VR, which covers your whole face,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAR has the potential to be different than other technologies as it provides a core user experience that bring the person and their environment closer together than any other type of technology,\u201d Blau says.\nWhy Apple is pursuing AR over VR\nDespite massive investments from Facebook, Google and others, VR is still in its infancy with critical mass at least five years out, according to Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research . \u201cI think AR will offer more potential in the shorter term because it will be powered by smartphones and will offer benefits in people's daily lives by adding a digital overlay to the reality we will experience in the physical world around us,\u201d he says. \u201cAR will be used in more places and for more minutes per day.\u201d\nAR is also rising on the heels of mobility, which has activated many adjacent technologies, according to Husson. \u201cSomehow as consumers we are using mobile as a sixth sense to explore the world around us,\u201d he says. \u201cCreating new AR experiences on top of smartphones will be quite disruptive. If the human senses serve as effortless faculties through which we access information on the world around us, then mobile has become the sixth sense. It brings digital to consumers in their daily lives.\u201d\nApple\u2019s iPhone business will be a tremendous asset for the company to tap into as it pushes further into AR, according to Christian Renaud, research director at 451 Research . Apple\u2019s large developer community is also familiar with, and generally excited to develop applications rapidly for new Apple hardware, Renaud says.\n\u201cVR, although valuable in its own right, is somewhat limited to gaming and a subset of professional applications right now, neither of which are square in Apple\u2019s wheelhouse,\u201d he says. \u201cAR, on the other hand, is already present in early forms on the iPhone with things like Yelp\u2019s Monocle feature and Google Translate\u2019s real-time translation. What is missing is the innovative interface to display this data in context.\u201d\n[ Related: 2017 will be big year for AI thanks to tech giants ]\nPredicting Apple\u2019s next move in AR is almost futile, but Cook\u2019s comments paired with technological advancements and increased investment, at least suggest something related to AR could be on the horizon. \u201cI think it would make sense for the iPhone's tenth anniversary,\u201d Husson says.\n\u201cBy analogy with the previous industrial revolution, mobile is like electricity: Once you have access to it, it is a disruptive enabler of adjacent technologies powering more powerful innovation,\u201d he says. \u201cLet's not forget smartphones are barely entering their teenage years.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-17T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The chip maker bungled it up once, but is coming on strong the second time.\nIntel passed on the opportunity to make chips for the first iPhone, and in May discontinued Atom smartphone chips after wasting billions trying to get them in handsets. The chip company instead started building a new mobile identity around its modems and wireless connectivity assets.\nIntel's had success, and some iPhone 7 smartphones are already using the chip maker's modem. The company is now building faster modems, and carrying out trials for future 5G wireless networks.\n[ Don\u2019t miss customer reviews of top remote access tools and see the most powerful IoT companies . | Get daily insights by signing up for Network World newsletters . ]\nThe transformation has been quick, and that's something the chip maker will boast at next week's Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. MWC is a \"coming out party\" for 5G, said Aicha Evans, senior vice president and general manager of the Communications and Devices Group at Intel, in an interview.\nIn name, 5G is a successor to 4G, but it is a lot more versatile and significantly faster. Beyond smartphones, it will also go into autonomous cars, drones, smart home devices, industrial equipment and a wide range of internet of things devices.\nIntel realized that it had to look beyond smartphones, and expand connectivity for the network of 50 billion devices in the IoT world, Evans said. More than the CPU, the communications technologies were important, and the company had to bulk up its wireless assets.\nPCs will also use 5G in gaming, VR and other applications. For example, 5G could be used to connect PCs wirelessly to VR headsets. 5G -- which will include a range of wireless technologies -- will connect PCs wirelessly to monitors and other external peripherals. In effect, it could help build a \"wire-free\" PC, an idea Intel has been chasing for years.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\n5G brings unprecedented long-range communication capabilities and data transfer speeds that could surpass 45Gbps, Evans said. That is more than double the speed of 20Gbps speed for 5G set by International Telecommunication Union in 2015.\nThere will be big changes in the designs of networks, devices and infrastructure, and Intel is preparing for that future through modems, development kits and 5G trials, Evans said.\nAt MWC, Intel will announce the readiness of its first 5G Modem silicon made using the 14-nanometer process, which will ship for testing in the second half this year. Intel first announced 5G Modem at CES.\nThe path to 5G is through faster 4G models. Intel at the show will also announce the new gigabit-speed XMM7560 4G modem. The modem is a big deal for Intel, which is trying to catch up with its rival Qualcomm, which has a headstart on 4G and 5G modem technologies. Qualcomm last October announced its first gigabit-class modem, the Snapdragon X50, which is scheduled to appear in many mobile devices in the coming quarters.\nWhile smartphones will technically be able to achieve gigabit 4G download speeds, most cellular networks still don't operate at that speed. An exception is Telstra, which has launched a gigabit LTE network in Australia.\nIntel could not say when the gigabit-class 4G modem would be in mobile devices. But the modem is ready, Evans said.\nIntel will also show off some uses for 5G in autonomous cars and how it could make driving safe. BMW, together with Intel and Mobileye, is developing an autonomous car that should hit the road in 2021. The 5G car could be hooked into a grid for energy management, or a smart city infrastructure -- like a smart streetlight system -- for safer driving. A 5G car could draw data from a wider range of sources outside the regular cameras, lidar and radar in a car for better collision avoidance, maps and navigation data.\nMany 5G technologies are being developed in partnership with companies like Ericsson, Nokia, and carriers like AT&T, Verizon, China Mobile, Vodafone, DoCoMo and Telefonica. Intel also announced a new initiative with Ericsson and Honeywell called 5GI2 to advance 5G testing and innovations.\nIntel also announced a development kit called the 3rd Generation Mobile Trial Platform that enables faster 5G testing. The kit includes a board based on Stratix 10 FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), and offers data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps.\nIt supports a wide range of bands including 600 to 900Mhz, 4.4 to 4.9Ghz, 5.1 to 5.9Ghz and the high-speed 28Ghz and 39Ghz bands. Cellular networks typically operate in the sub-6Ghz band, but higher bands will enable 5G deployment trials. That board could be used by carriers or companies that want to try out 5G network applications.\nIt'll be many years before we can look at 5G in the same vein as 4G. But it's coming quickly, and one just need to look at the quick ascension of 4G to realize how quickly technologies can change.\nFor 5G, \"we look at 4G ten years before it got to big success,\" Evans said.\nJoin the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-21T11:05:00Z", "images": []}

That's the case with Qualcomm, for example, which packages ARM's processor core with its own LTE modems to deliver the chips at the heart of Apple's iPhones.\nBut now ARM wants to deliver the whole stack itself, at least for low-power, low-bandwidth devices, ARM wireless business general manager Paul Williamson said in a blog post Tuesday.\n[ Don\u2019t miss customer reviews of top remote access tools and see the most powerful IoT companies . | Get daily insights by signing up for Network World newsletters . ]\nTo further that goal, the company is investing in its own radio designs, and has acquired two companies with expertise in the NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) low-power wireless standard: a Swedish one, Mistbase, and a British one, NextG-Com. Mistbase designs chips, while NextG-Com writes networking software.\nProcessors built to ARM's designs require little power, at least compared to the power-hungry chips found in desktop and laptop PCs. That's what made them attractive to smartphone manufacturers.\nBut phones, especially the latest 4G phones, are still power-hungry compared to many of the devices that make up the internet of things. A smartphone with a 10 watt-hour battery will run for a day or two before needing a recharge, whereas NB-IoT was developed for devices that must run for up to 10 years on a single 5 Wh battery . The trade-off is that NB-IoT devices will only be able to transmit at up to 20 kilobits per second, or perhaps 250 kbps, compared to megabits per second for a typical smartphone.\nIt's in the market for such devices that ARM sees a big advantage in more closely tying the design of the processor with that of the wide-area radio modem, something it already does for Bluetooth wireless devices.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-21T13:12:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "KGI: OLED iPhone 8 to feature \u2018revolutionary\u2019 3D-sensing front camera, detects depth for games and facial recognition", "content": "Reddit\nApple\u2019s\u00a0upcoming iPhone 8 is going to feature a major upgrade to the front camera, according to Apple analyst KGI Ming-Chi Kuo.\u00a0A report published today says that the OLED iPhone will include a \u2018revolutionary\u2019 front camera and Infrared module that can sense the 3D space in front of it.\nThe analyst says the new\u00a0components will be able to\u00a0merge the depth information with the 2D images from the front camera for applications including face recognition, iris recognition, and 3D selfies \u2026\nTry Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial\nThe analyst says the advanced 3D front camera system could be used in new innovative games that can accurately replace\u00a0a character\u2019s head with that of the user.\u00a0The combination of front camera and 3D sensor would allow\u00a0the iPhone to generate a 3D selfie which could be used in augmented reality.\nThe hardware will use algorithms developed by PrimeSense, which Apple acquired in 2013 . The sensor will apparently be able to detect the location and depth of objects it can see. Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 Plus already includes\u00a0an immature form of depth detection by including two rear cameras that use their optical parallax offset to determine distance away.\nKGI says the 3D sensing front camera for iPhone 8 would be much more advanced using a dedicated Infrared\u00a0transmitter and receiver. The Infrared transmitter will apparently use vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser\u00a0technology from Lumentum ( as previously rumored ), the front camera will be produced by Sony and the IR receiver will be manufactured by Foxconn/Sharp.\u00a0The 3D system works by\u00a0sending invisible IR\u00a0light signals outwards from the phone and then detecting the signals that bounce back off of objects using the\u00a01.4 megapixel IR receiver.\nLooking beyond\u00a02017, KGI says next-generation iPhones\u00a0will likely add 3D sensing rear cameras as well, potentially removing the need for\u00a0large dual camera iris systems. The analyst says Apple is years ahead of Android platform in terms of 3D algorithms\u00a0which will make the advanced 3D camera sensor a unique iPhone feature for a couple of years.\nThe OLED iPhone is expected to be a major upgrade\u00a0over the current iPhone 7 series in both design and functionality.\u00a0Moving away from LCD panels, Apple\u2019s upcoming flagship iPhone is rumoured to\u00a0feature a large 5.8 inch\u00a0OLED display with 520 PPI in a bezel-less glass design. The Home Button is expected to be replaced by a virtual \u2018function area\u2019 , leaving about 5.2 inch screen area for application content.\u00a0Despite the larger screen, the phone is expected to be amount the same size as a 4.7 inch iPhone 7 thanks to space savings\u00a0by removing almost all bezels.\nOther iPhone 8 rumors include the addition of\u00a0 wireless charging ,\u00a0 better water resistance , and some\u00a0 form of face recognition biometrics , which may tie in to the latest news of the 3D front camera.\u00a0The new iPhone 8\u00a0has been rumored to cost upwards of $1000 .\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-21T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Spotify expands its push into original content with new podcasts", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nSpotify is expanding its podcast selection today, with the announcement that it\u2019s adding three new original podcast series on its service, with plans for more originals to arrive later this year. The series, which are produced in partnership with other media partners like Slate spin-off Panoply Studios, Gimlet Media, and Loudspeaker Network, aim to help further differentiate Spotify\u2019s service from other streaming music rivals.\nThe company had already hosted podcasts on its platform, following its announcement back in 2015 that it would begin to include\u00a0new media types, such as video clips, activity-based playlists, and audio series. It\u2019s also no stranger to original content \u2013 a year after it detailed those\u00a0content expansion plans, the company said it would also begin to develop its own original videos. Some of these video series\u00a0turned out better than others , however.\nSpotify also experimented with original podcasts prior to now. For example, last fall\u00a0it launched \u201cClarify,\u201d an audio and video series produced by Spotify, Mic, and Headcount.org, which focused on the intersection of music and civic engagement. The goal was to influence younger Spotify users to vote and become informed on key issues.\nWith its\u00a0new original podcasts, Spotify is working with outside companies again, and the focus for the new shows is more on the music itself and the larger\u00a0industry.\nThe first of the three announced today is \u201cShowstopper,\u201d live now, which is hosted by\u00a0Naomi Zeichner, Editor in Chief of The Fader magazine. Produced in partnership with\u00a0Panoply, Zeichner will\u00a0interview music supervisors in order to offer a pop culture analysis of people\u2019s\u00a0favorite musical moments from\u00a0TV. The\u00a0first season of this biweekly series will cover music from shows including \u201cGirls,\u201d \u201cO.C.,\u201d \u201cScrubs,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cBeing Mary Jane,\u201d and others.\nThe other two shows coming soon are\u00a0\u201cUnpacked\u201d starting March 14 and \u201cThe Chris Lighty Story\u201d (working title) beginning in April. The former will feature co-hosts\u00a0Matt FX, music supervisor for Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cBroad City,\u201d and Michele Santucci of Spotify Studios, as they travel to festivals like SXSW and interview the creative types there.\nThe latter will document\u00a0how the music industry exec Chris Lighty shaped the careers of top hip hop artists like 50 Cent, LL Cool J, Missy Elliott, Foxy Brown, and Puff Daddy.\u00a0This podcast will be produced\u00a0in partnership with Gimlet Media and Loudspeaker Network.\nThe move to feature more original podcasts comes at a critical time for the company as competition between streaming services is heating up. Pandora recently launched new paid subscription tiers including on-demand listening, which pushes it more solidly into Spotify\u2019s territory, and Apple Music has been leveraging the power and install base of Apple\u2019s\u00a0iPhone platform to rapidly grow its own user base. It\u2019s delving into original content of its own, too, as with \u201cCarpool Karaoke.\u201d\nMeanwhile, podcasts themselves are seeing something of recurrence, thanks in part to the rise of streaming services and voice-based computing platforms, like Amazon Alexa, which make them easier to access outside of mobile devices.\nSpotify won\u2019t confirm how many other original podcasts it has planned, but the\u00a0company says more originals will be announced later this\u00a0year.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-23T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "EFF: Half of web traffic is now encrypted", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nHalf of the\u00a0web\u2019s traffic is now encrypted, according to a new report from the EFF released this week. The rights organization noted the milestone was attributable to a number of efforts, including recent moves from major tech companies to implement HTTPS on their own properties. Over the years, these efforts\u00a0have included pushes from Facebook and Twitter , back in 2013 and 2012 respectively, as well as those from other sizable sites like Google,\u00a0 Wikipedia , Bing, Reddit and more.\nGoogle played a significant role, having put pressure on websites to adopt HTTPS by beginning to use HTTPS as a signal in its search ranking algorithms. This year, it also ramped up the push towards HTTPS by marking websites that use HTTP connections for transmitting passwords and credit data as insecure .\nHTTPS, which encrypts data in transit and helps prevent a site from being modified by a malicious user on the network, has gained increased attention in recent years as users have woken up to how much of their web usage is tracked, and even spied on by their own government. Large-scale hacks have also generally made people more security-minded as well.\nA number of larger players on the web also switched on HTTPS in 2016, like WordPress.com which added support for HTTPS for all its custom domains, meaning the security and performance of the encryption technology became available every blog and website it hosted. Elsewhere in the blogosphere, Google made HTTPS connections the default in May 2016 for all the sites on its Blogspot domain, after having made HTTPS optional in fall 2015.\nMore recently,\u00a0the U.S. Government has made strides toward ditching HTTP, with the news that all new executive branch domains would\u00a0use HTTPS starting\u00a0in the spring of this year.\u00a0Another report on the\u00a0federal government\u2019s adoption of HTTPS \u00a0from January found that\u00a0of roughly 1,000 .gov domains, 61 percent enforce HTTPS.\nAnd on the mobile web, Apple told iOS developers that HTTPS connections were required for apps by the end of last year, though it later extended that deadline.\u00a0\nMany major news organizations have also moved forward (including us !), while efforts like the Let\u2019s Encrypt project have helped pushed others, including WordPress, to take advantage of\u00a0the technology. The EFF also has its own tool, Certbot , that is being used to help webmasters \u2013 even those running smaller sites \u2013 make the switch.\nThe EFF noted that the average volume of encrypted web traffic varies depending on which browser maker is reporting their metrics. However, Mozilla recently said that more of its traffic is encrypted than unencrypted. Google\u2019s Chrome, which is widely adopted, is more in line with the \u201c50%\u201d figure, the EFF found, as it said that over half of web pages are protected by HTTPS across different operating systems.\nNot all sites support HTTPS or have it as the default, of course. The Chrome extension HTTPS Everywhere can help with the latter, but more efforts still need to happen to get the other half the web encrypted as well.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-22T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Upcoming iPhone may map your face with a 3D camera", "content": "This render shows the same hypothetical phone in various colours.\nCredit:behance.net/imrantaylor\nYou may have heard in passing, however, that facial recognition technology has had some problems. Companies including Hewlett-Packard and Nikon have faced criticism when their cameras had trouble recognising non-white faces and features. Some experts say that problem could arise when the algorithms aren't exposed to a variety of faces while in development.\nSecurity experts have also raised questions about facial recognition as a form of authentication because it doesn't always work that well. Wearing a baseball cap or even makeup can keep some sensors from recognising your face, experts said. People have also found ways to trick some types of facial recognition scans , such as holding a video of a phone owner's face up to less sophisticated recognition sensors.\nBut experts say that Apple's reported plan to use a depth-sensing camera for the feature addresses those issues.\n\"You can get much more accurate readings,\" said Chester Wisniewski of the security firm Sophos. \"There are things that can mess with visual sensors. This sees through makeup, to tissue.\" Plus, he said, this type of camera isn't easily fooled; even a 3D-printed model of a face shouldn't trick it.\nAccording to Consumer Reports, these sorts of cameras have also been shown to have fewer problems recognising dark skin tones. Microsoft's version of depth-sensing cameras \u2014 made by Intel \u2014 can tell identical twins apart, according to tests.\nBut there's one concern about facial recognition technology that may not be resolved by a depth-sensing camera: privacy. The technology would likely give these companies a pretty comprehensive map of your face, which may give some people the creeps and raise fears about how the identification data could be used. Of course, we won't know how Apple will handle this data until an official announcement. And we won't know until then whether the feature can be disabled by the user.\nApple has made several public commitments to protecting user privacy and information. When it introduced the photo features last June, the company took great pains to explain that it stores information only on a person's device, just as it does with your fingerprints .\nThe company also has said that it practices what's called \" differential privacy ,\" a type of data collection that aims to prevent the ability to identify someone by their phone data.\nWhile some privacy experts lauded Apple for taking those steps, however, they also called on the company to give customers more information about how the data is collected, used and shared.\nResearchers from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to digital rights, said last year that Apple's approach to privacy should be applauded but that Apple should be more open about its methods and research to enable \"technologists, researchers, and companies to learn from it\" and advance privacy standards in the industry overall.\nApple has focused heavily on developing facial recognition technology in recent years. In addition to acquiring PrimeSense, the company that developed the original Kinect, Apple has bought a handful of facial recognition companies \u2014 including one firm that will animate your facial expressions in real time. Just last week, Israeli media reported that Apple picked up a start-up called RealFace , which uses facial recognition for security purposes.\nThe Washington Post\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-23T00:16:55Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple Says Nebraska Will Become A 'Mecca For Hackers' If Right To Repair Bill Passes", "content": "Apple Says Nebraska Will Become A 'Mecca For Hackers' If Right To Repair Bill Passes\nfrom the nebraska-cornhackers dept\nTue, Feb 21st 2017 6:33am \u2014 Tim Cushing\nIt looks like Apple decided to drop in on flyover country in hopes of thwarting a \"Right to Repair\" bill pending in the Nebraska legislature. It did not go well .\n[T]he prospect of a Cupertino-based megacorporation losing business to local repair shops isn't a very sympathetic argument at the Nebraska statehouse. And so Apple has tried a slew of other tactics, according to state Sen. Lydia Brasch, who was recently visited by Steve Kester, an Apple state government affairs specialist.\n\"Apple said we would be the only state that would pass this, and that we would become the mecca for bad actors,\" Brasch, who is sponsoring the bill, told me in a phone call. \"They said that doing this would make it very easy for hackers to relocate to Nebraska.\"\nApple probably expected its heavy-handed (and stupid -- more on that in a bit) \"suggestion\" to be taken more seriously by podunk legislators in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately for Apple, Brasch isn't just a legislator in a state mainly known for corn and football-as-religion.\nBrasch is not only an Apple customer, but she's a farmer who has had to deal with plenty of repair-blocking BS from companies like John Deere. She also has a background in computer science and an apparent tendency to not let corporate lawyers talk down to her.\nNot only did Apple pick the wrong legislator to threaten, its threat is incoherent. I've spent most of the last 15 years in the Midwest and, trust me, it would take far more than a right-to-repair bill's passage to make Nebraska a mecca of anything. (Beyond college football, he said to head off the Cornhusker faithful most likely already demanding a retraction\u2026)\nThen there's the thing about \"hackers.\" There's more than one type of hacker, but Apple dropped it as a pejorative term in hopes of conjuring images of hoodied figures sitting in dark rooms with the local SWAT team on speed dial and deploying some sort of encryption\u2026 you know, the evil kind.\nAll sorts of nonsensical arguments are already being raised in response to a handful of right-to-repair bills around the nation. The corporate version of \"you'll shoot your eye out\" has been deployed to portray DIY repair jobs as hospitalizations waiting to happen .\nThe idea that it's \"unsafe\" to repair your own devices is one that manufacturers have been promoting for years. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and \"plans to bring band aids.\"\nApple's take is this: the \"hacker mecca\" thing plus a very short parade of not-all-that-horribles.\nBrasch said the representatives made two other main arguments: They said repair could cause lithium batteries to catch fire, and said that there are already enough authorized places to get iPhones repaired, such as the Apple store.\nDefine \"enough.\" As Brasch points out, getting her devices repaired \"conveniently\" involves setting up an appointment at the nearest Apple store, which is 80 miles from where she lives. Apple certainly doesn't mind taking money from rurally-located customers when selling devices. But it's not nearly as willing to make repairing their purchased products actually convenient.\nAnd it's not just Apple. Other phone manufacturers have spoken to Brasch in an attempt to get her to drop the legislation, or at least rewrite it in their favor.\n\"They said just take out the 'phone' part of the bill and we'll go away,\" Brasch said. \"That's tempting, but we need to repair consumer technology too.\"\nBrasch's bill sprung out of her frustration with repairing her farm's equipment, which has been made increasingly difficult by John Deere's refusal to allow anyone other than repair shops it makes to profit from touching its products. Phone manufacturers have the same attitude. They express faux concern about consumer safety while preventing consumers from having any control over how their purchased devices are repaired. The concern most of these companies have for their consumers only extends as far as their ability to purchase add-ons, new products, and inconvenient repairs at non-competitive prices. The battle is over bottom lines, not consumer safety, no matter how it's spun and no matter how many hacker-based horror stories are spun.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-21T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Apple showed the way years ago with its iWork suite (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote), and Microsoft has validated the notion with its Office suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). Of course there's also Google G Suite (Docs, Sheets, and Slides), which includes mobile versions of the apps for iOS.\n[UPDATED MARCH 27, 2017] Which of these office suites should you use on your iPad?

{"title": "When test-driving a new car, take the technology for a spin", "content": "NewsOK: Oklahoma City News, Sports, Weather & Entertainment\nWhen test-driving a new car, take the technology for a spin\nPublished: Thu, February 23, 2017 9:01 AM Updated: Thu, February 23, 2017 9:02 AM\nshares\nAdvertisement\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Car shopping isn't just about kicking the tires anymore. It's also about testing the technology.\nThe rapidly evolving in-car infotainment and navigation systems can be bewildering for all but the most tech-savvy car buyers. The average vehicle on U.S. roads is 11 years old; that means many people last went car shopping before iPhones were invented.\nCar buyers should make sure they can pair their phone with a car, play music from their phone, make a hands-free call and use the navigation system before they leave the dealer lot, experts say. They should make sure volume knobs, climate controls and other technology is intuitive and displayed the way they like. Some drivers want volume controls on the steering wheel, for example, while others prefer a knob on the dashboard.\nSafety technology is also changing rapidly, and buyers should familiarize themselves with what the car can and can't do. Some vehicles will brake automatically to avoid a collision, while others flash a warning and help the driver pump the brakes but won't bring the car to a full stop.\n\"Spend some time in the parking lot sitting in the car and just messing with it,\" says Ron Montoya, senior consumer advice editor for the car shopping site Edmunds.com.\nThe issue is a serious one for the auto industry. Consumers' complaints about phone connectivity, navigation and infotainment systems have lowered vehicle dependability scores in annual rankings from J.D. Power and Consumer Reports. Poor showings in such rankings can put a dent in sales. Car shopping site Autotrader.com has found that as many as one-third of buyers will choose a different brand if they think a vehicle's tech features are too hard to use.\nTo combat that, some brands are setting up technology help desks at dealerships and boosting employee training. In 2013, General Motors Co. formed a staff of 50 tech specialists to help deal with an increase in questions from customers about new technology. Those specialists train U.S. dealers to pair customers' phones, set up in-car Wi-Fi and set preferences like radio stations.\nWhen he takes customers for test drives, Paul Makowski pairs his own phone with the car and has customers make a call, stream music and do other tasks. He uses his own phone so customers don't worry that their data will be shared with the dealership.\n\"Some people fear the technology and decline it all, but we still go over it. They don't leave here not knowing what their car has to offer,\" says Makowski, the sales manager for Ed Rinke Chevrolet Buick GMC in Center Line, Michigan.\nHere are some tips for taking a tech test drive:\n\u2014 TAKE YOUR TIME: Test driving the technology should take at least 45 minutes, says Brian Moody, the executive editor at AutoTrader.com. Find out whether your phone is compatible with the car and learn how to pair it. Call a friend and ask if the sound is clear. Make sure the car understands your voice commands. Enter an address into the navigation system or, if the car has the capability, download an address to the car from your phone. Moody says it's better to learn all these tasks at the dealership than on the road.\n\u2014 UPDATE YOUR PHONE: Make sure your phone has the latest operating system when you go shopping. New cars will be most compatible with updated phones.\n(Story continued below...)\n\u2014 DECIDE WHAT YOU LIKE: Six percent of new cars sold last year had Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which display many of your phone's apps on the touchscreen. That's expected to rise to 50 percent by 2020, according to IHS Markit. The familiar interface of those systems can make it easier to transition to in-car technology. But Montoya says there are some shortcomings. Apple CarPlay doesn't support the Waze traffic app or Google maps, for example, and if you want to change a radio station, you have to scroll out of Apple CarPlay and back to your car's radio. You should decide what system is best for you.\n\u2014 SHOP AROUND: Even if you've settled on a vehicle, it never hurts to test drive something else. You may find, for example, that you prefer climate controls on a touchscreen instead of on dashboard knobs, or that one vehicle has easier-to-use buttons on the steering wheel for making calls or adjusting volume. \"It might expose you to something better,\" Montoya says.\n\u2014 DON'T FORGET SAFETY: Lane departure warning systems, backup cameras and blind-spot detection systems work differently depending on the car. Some lane departure systems buzz the seat if you drift out of your lane, for example, while others beep loudly. That's something you might hear or feel a lot, so choose the technology you prefer.\n\u2014 BUY WHAT YOU NEED: Not everyone wants to stream Spotify and chat with Siri while they're driving. If you're in that category, choose a stripped-down model so you're not paying for features you don't need, Montoya says. For example, a Toyota Camry starts at $23,050, but the EnTune infotainment package, which includes hands-free calling and other features, costs $775 extra.\nAssociated Press\nNews from The Associated Press, and a taste of the great journalism produced by AP members and customers.

{"title": "The BlackBerry Mercury is now the KeyOne", "content": "Brian Heater @bheater / 2 years\nIf you thought the BlackBerry Mercury had a bit of a codename vibe to it, you weren\u2019t wrong. Today at Mobile World Congress, TCL officially took the wraps of its first true BlackBerry handset, now going by the admittedly less sleek KeyOne (pronounced \u201ckey one,\u201d) name. Though I suppose when your company is attempting to plant its flag firmly in the world of enterprise, sexy probably isn\u2019t the main thing you\u2019re looking for in a name.\nThe device looks much the same as it did when we saw it at CES, back when it shared a name with a Roman messenger god, small planet and element/poisoning you get from consuming too much seafood. TCL\u2019s clearly gone out of its way to create something iconic that fits squarely with what most of think of when we think of BlackBerry.\nIt\u2019s a tall device give its 4.5-inch screen \u2013 that owes mostly to the inclusion of the physical keyboard on the bottom, that most BlackBerry of features. New here since last time is the inclusion of a fingerprint reader in the keyboard\u2019s spacebar, a cool little extra.\nSo, how many people are still looking for a physical keyboard in 2017? TCL/BlackBerry mobility GM Bruce Walpole admitted that demand is nowhere near where it was when the Canadian company\u2019s marketshare first started eroding at the hands of the iPhone ilk. \u201cWe asked if people would consider a physical keyboard,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cTwenty-five-percent of people said they would consider it.\u201d\nSo, essentially, there\u2019s potential demand there. \u201cConsider\u201d is pretty non-committal. With the KeyOne, the company has to convert \u201cconsider\u201d into \u201ccustomer,\u201d which is always easier said than done. \u201cNo question,\u201d \u00a0Walpole answers, \u201cbut if we can capture half of that, it\u2019s a pretty decent number.\u201d\nSo, half of a quarter \u2014 a pretty modest proposal.\n\u201cIt is for the person who was forced onto a flat glass but wants to come back,\u201d says TCL\u2019s North American President, Steve Cistulli, \u201cThere\u2019s no compromise. In the past there, there was always a compromise, screen size, keyboards or apps. Here there\u2019s no compromise.\u201d\nIt\u2019s essentially an Android device, loaded with BlackBerry security and software designed by TCL to appeal to both those who want a touchscreen and a keyboard. But the company will still be offering devices for those who made the jump to touchscreens and haven\u2019t looked back.\nThe fact that the KeyOne will be one of a number of concurrent devices in the TCL/BlackBerry portfolio. According to Cistulli, the company is aiming to have around three devices on the market at a given time, at least one of which will be a sort of evolution of the DTEK 50/60 devices that first saw the two companies teaming up.\nThe KeyOne will be the first of the bunch, naturally, arriving in North America (the US and Canada, at least) in late April, priced at $549. US users will be able to buy it online at launch. The company is, perhaps unsurprisingly, focused on enterprise first, followed by \u201cbring your own devicers.\u201d That means it\u2019ll take some time before getting to any kind of wider retail availability.\nAnd perhaps if it can get it into people\u2019s hands through their companies, it can rekindle that connection with the physical keyboard. And their current goals with the first generation device seem pretty modest like the specs inside, including the Snapdragon 625. The device will ship with Android 7.1, but Assistant won\u2019t be preloaded.\nEssentially, it\u2019s a work-focused device and the specs reflect that, pushing things up in the battery department with a beefy 3,505mAh battery that promises a day of use.\nTCL\u2019s got an uphill battle on its hands, reintroducing the BlackBerry line to an audience with a short memory. But at the very least, it\u2019s coming out of the gate with a pretty interesting device. \u201cA lot of companies are specifically going after Apple and Samsung,\u201d says Cistulli. \u201cMost people will aim high and fall pretty fast. There is a niche though for the enterprise space.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-25T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

In keeping with Apple\u2019s stringent quality standards, we believe: (1) related optical components, including VCSEL, DOE, wafer-level lens and filter for IR transmitting module, and CIS, filter and lens of IR receiver module have all been custom-designed in collaboration with suppliers; and (2) calibration of front camera, IR transmitting and IR receiving modules via active alignment is required in order to allow the 3D camera system to operate precisely.\nTo translate from analyst speak, Kuo is saying that the 3D camera system is so complicated and has been in development so long that he believes the design that Apple\u2019s factories currently have is locked down and unlikely to change before the next-generation iPhone launches.\nIn a note earlier this week , Kuo detailed what he\u2019s heard about the iPhone 3D camera system.\nOne application could be for games to show the user\u2019s face in the place of a character. Other applications include facial recognition.\nUltimately, Kuo writes that Apple may be looking to diversify its suppliers for the complicated camera module, so it gets better prices by playing competitors off each other. But the suppliers he\u2019s heard from say the 3D camera has been locked down \u2014 so suppliers that might be able to sell components to Apple, like Himax, probably won\u2019t until next year.\nHere\u2019s his breakdown of the technologies involved:\nKGI Securities\nHere are some other rumours we\u2019ve been hearing about the \u201ciPhone 8,\u201d a redesigned model expected to launch this fall:\nApple could sell a model with a 5.8-inch wraparound screen, with no borders or bezels, using OLED display technology, which enables darker blacks and better power consumption.\nThe construction of the iPhone 8 could be glass and stainless steel.\nThe home button could be integrated with the screen.\nIt could include wireless charging, allowing it to power up without plugging in a cable.\nIt won\u2019t have a headphone jack.\nIt could cost more than $US1,000.\nNOW WATCH: Tech Insider videos\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-24T15:00:01Z", "images": []}

People prefer to stream and if they like the music they may buy it later on.\u2019\nIn contrast to the boom in audio streaming, music downloads and CD purchases are on the decline, falling 30 and 12 per cent respectively last year. Last year, 47 million CDs were bought while 18 million albums were downloaded.\nMeanwhile, although vinyl is enjoying a resurgence of interest, with sales up by 50 per cent last year, only 3.2 million albums were bought.\nThe number of albums listened to through streaming last year was estimated to be 45 million.\n'IT IS A BIT OF A LUXURY, BUT I GET ACCESS TO SO MUCH MUSIC'\u00a0\nMusic fan: Helen admits paying for music each month is a 'bit of a luxury'\nHelen Wilce streams music through the family home \u2013 using provider Tidal.\nThe 46-year-old housewife, from Warmington in Warwickshire, recently upgraded to the higher quality sound service that costs \u00a320 a month.\nShe says: \u2018I want to make the most of my existing stereo equipment and stream through it some of the best quality music sound available.\u2019\u00a0\nShe adds: \u2018It is a bit of a luxury but I find it easy to justify paying for streaming as it costs\u00a0the same price as a couple of CDs or vinyl records a month.\n\u2018But this way, I get access to more music than I could ever afford.\u2019\nHOW TO HOOK UP TO ONLINE MUSIC\u00a0\u00a0\nStreaming relies on the internet because you are listening to a constant \u2018stream\u2019 of music data being piped over the web in real time.\u00a0\nIt is not to be confused with downloading music off the internet into a file as is often done in Mp3 format.\nThanks to improved internet speeds and reliability, most households can easily tap into the technology through their computer or smartphone.\nEven if you use basic broadband piped down a telephone wire it should work fine, though you may occasionally lose connection if others in the home are using the internet at the same time and the speed drops to below one megabit per second.\nStand-off: Singer Taylor Swift does not allow her music on Spotify because of the low royalties it pays\nThose using fibre optics should never have trouble streaming favourite tunes.\nFirst, you must download a free app that provides the software that enables you to gain access to the millions of musical tracks available on the internet.\nThe biggest music streaming provider is Spotify but others also worth considering include Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, Deezer, Google Play Music, Napster, Qobuz and Tidal.\nThese companies usually offer free trials or a basic streaming service for nothing, so it is possible to listen to music without spending money.\u00a0\nBut they will often then try to get you to sign up to enjoy valuable extras, such as being able to download music through the app that you can listen to later, for a \u2018premium\u2019 price of perhaps \u00a310 a month.\u00a0\nThis service is great when you want to listen to music later on when not connected to the internet, perhaps if you are out travelling on public transport.\u00a0\nIt is important to remember that any music stored will automatically disappear when a contract ends.\nGennaro Castaldo, a spokesman for the British Phonographic Industry, says: \u2018Streaming enhances the whole experience of enjoying music.\u00a0\n'It offers a wonderful way for people to experience all kinds of music that they might never have listened to before. Many people now stream to develop their musical tastes. They then perhaps buy a hard copy as a CD or vinyl if they really love it.\u2019\nAlthough it is possible to stream music through internet connections on your phone using networks such a 3G and 4G, it is important to be aware that there could be hefty additional charges.\u00a0\nMusic streaming can use 100 megabytes of data per hour and if you exceed a mobile phone package limit then charges can escalate up to \u00a35 a megabyte.\nTidal wave: Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Madonna and Beyonce attend a music stream launch event\nThe top streaming services\u00a0\nGadget review website Pocket-lint says you should look at Apple Music which has a 19 cent stake of the market. But it believes smaller niche players can have more interesting content and intuitive features that big companies often fail to offer.\nIt recommends exploring Amazon Music Unlimited, Deezer, Google Play Music, Mixcloud, Napster, Qobuz and Tidal before deciding on which streamer to use.\nMusic streaming is dominated by Swedish firm Spotify, which has more than 40 million subscribers worldwide and a 44 per cent slice of the market.\nYet despite Spotify\u2019s mass-market appeal there are other providers that you should consider.\nIt is the biggest provider in the market with 40 million paying subscribers and 125 million users overall. You can listen for free if willing to suffer occasional adverts.\nPremium service is \u00a39.99 a month and allows you to also listen offline, enjoying stored music when not on the internet.\u00a0\nA family package (maximum six) is available for \u00a314.99 a month while students pay a discounted rate of \u00a34.99 a month.\nAPPLE MUSIC\nThe Apple music service was only launched in 2015 and is already the second biggest.\u00a0\nAs with Spotify, individual membership costs \u00a39.99 a month, family membership for up to six people costs \u00a314.99 and discounted student membership costs \u00a34.99 a month.\nAMAZON MUSIC UNLIMITED \u00a0\nUnlimited streaming costs \u00a33.99 a month for one Amazon music device such as an Echo.\u00a0\nFor \u00a39.99 a month \u2013 discounted to \u00a37.99 a month for Prime members already signed up to the \u00a369 a year next-day postal service \u2013 you can also use smartphones and laptops. You pay \u00a314.99 a month for a family of six to use.\nDEEZER\u00a0\nA French streaming company offers a free basic listening service where it provides an unlimited mix of songs it thinks you might enjoy.\u00a0\nA premium service where you pick the tracks costs \u00a39.99 a month and you can store music offline.\nA family service for six people offering unlimited music is \u00a314.99 a month.\nProvided by the biggest internet search engine, this streaming service gives access to millions of music tracks and costs \u00a39.99 a month. A similar service for a family of six is \u00a314.99 a month.\nThe relationships which companies have with artists is another consideration.\nFor example, singer Taylor Swift does not offer her music on Spotify because she is annoyed it pays less than 0.01p to an artist every time one of their tunes is streamed.\nApple Music, which Taylor Swift has signed up to, claims to pay about 70 per cent of the monthly subscription fee from customers back to music labels and artists.\nWIRED FOR SOUND...THE GADGETS THAT LINK IN TO YOUR WI-FI\u00a0\nMany people enjoy listening to online music through headphones, but by hooking up to other gadgets you can make even more out of the experience.\nThe benefit of having tunes broadcast through wi-fi is that you can invest in equipment to pipe them throughout the house wherever you put speakers \u2013 with your mobile as a music remote control.\nStuart Miles, founder of technology review website Pocket-lint, says: \u2018Choosing a streaming service is just the start of the adventure.\u00a0\nThere are lots of exciting gadgets for listening to music throughout the house for a relatively modest price.\u00a0\nFor example, \u00a3170 can buy you a speaker from a company such as Sonos which has a built-in amp and can be placed anywhere in the house to play streamed music.\u00a0\n\u2018It links to the service you have signed up to on your smartphone or computer through wi-fi.\u2019\nThat old-fashioned stereo sitting in the corner of your living room can also get a 21st Century reboot to stream music through existing speakers.\nLucas, of What Hi-Fi?, says: \u2018There are some amazing music streaming devices out there.\n\u2018You can buy a small gadget such as a Google Chromecast Audio for about \u00a330 that can be plugged into the stereo and talks wirelessly to your laptop or mobile phone streaming app.\u2019\nHe adds: \u2018Spend \u00a3700 on a Cambridge Audio streamer and you have a brilliant piece of streaming equipment.\n\u2018If money is no object, the \u00a315,800 Linn Klimax has exceptional sound quality.\u2019\nMusic streaming quality can also vary depending on the provider. So-called \u2018master quality authenticated\u2019 (MQA) allows high-resolution sounds of superior quality to CD, offered by providers such as Tidal. Qobuz also offers streaming that can sound better than CD.\nHi-fi trader Sevenoaks Sound & Vision suggests hi-resolution streaming devices such as a \u00a3500 Bluesound Node are best for those who wish to listen to a superior sound.\nEDITOR'S DEALS OF THE WEEK\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-25T21:47:30Z", "images": []}

As you might imagine, Amazon is taking a cut.\nAmazon\nAnd that cut adds\u00a0up quickly \u2014 it\u2019s this exact business model that makes Valve-owned Steam such a juggernaut . On an even broader scale, this is how Apple makes money on the iPhone/iPad App Store.\u00a0\nThe twist with buying games directly through Twitch is that part of the cut also goes toward the streamer (as long as the streamer is part of Twitch\u2019s \u201cpartner program,\u201d that is). That means Twitch streamers can make a cut of the profits from the sales of whatever game they\u2019re streaming.\nAmazon\nFrench game maker/publisher Ubisoft is one of the first major publishers that\u2019s part of Twitch\u2019s new service.\nIt also means that the large, loyal audiences that follow Twitch streamers can be directly monetized \u2014 Twitch already makes money from those audiences through advertising, as well as through a paid \u201cPro\u201d service that removes adds and grants other benefits. This enables yet another avenue for Amazon to cash in on the millions of people watching game streams on Twitch.\nTwitch\nStreams of games like \u2018League of Legends\u2019 often draw (virtual) crowds of thousands.\nWhen the service launches this spring on Twitch, you won\u2019t be able to buy every game you see being streamed \u2014 just those where the game\u2019s developer and/or publisher worked with Twitch to make it happen.

{"title": "YouTube is coming to Comcast\u2019s Xfinity X1 set-top box", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nGoogle and Comcast announced a new deal this morning that will see the YouTube application installed on Comcast\u2019s Xfinity X1 set-top boxes nationwide later this year. The integration will allow X1\u00a0users to launch the app by saying \u201c YouTube\u201d into the X1 voice remote, as well as browse featured content on YouTube, search the entire library, including by voice, and sign into to access their own personalized YouTube settings and subscriptions.\nComcast says around half of its 22.5 million Xfinity customers have the newer X1 set-top box system, which includes a DVR with 500 GB of storage, voice remote, real-time sports scores, and other more modern features.\nThe cable provider had already added Netflix to its X1 devices last year \u2013 another significant milestone in terms of merging the online streaming world with traditional TV content. The deal saw Netflix content and Xfinity on Demand programming combined into a single library, to make switching between services more seamless.\nSimilarly, Comcast will integrate YouTube into the X1 in a unique way. Instead of being a standalone app to\u00a0launch, as\u00a0on other streaming boxes like Apple TV, Roku or Amazon Fire TV, for example, YouTube content is showcased directly in the X1 user interface alongside the shows provided by the cable service.\nFor example, if you\u2019re browsing cooking shows, the X1 may display TV titles like \u201cTop Chef\u201d or \u201cCake Wars,\u201d and then below will feature YouTube cooking shows and videos. (See screenshot).\nThis seems like a more natural way to make YouTube content accessible to the TV\u2019s big screen, instead of keeping it isolated as a standalone app.\nAfter all, the\u00a0YouTube Red subscription service on its own is not strong enough to warrant launching its app on a regular basis, and traditional cable TV viewers tend to be older than the young fans that favor YouTube stars over Hollywood actors.\u00a0 In other words, Comcast\u2019s cable subscribers probably wouldn\u2019t launch YouTube as often, if its library wasn\u2019t promoted as this more integrated experience.\nIn addition, because YouTube\u2019s app\u00a0is designed to work with the X1 voice remote, there are a number of ways you can access YouTube content just by speaking.

Those figures look great, so why are experts cautious?\nSome are not convinced the app can make money, others are concerned about a slowing in its user numbers.\nSome investors have refused to take part in the initial public offering after it emerged that new shareholders will not get voting rights, calling it a \u2018major red flag\u2019. Others are simply wary about getting their fingers burnt.\u00a0\nRELATED ARTICLES\nTechnology is a notoriously risky place to invest.\u00a0Fast-growing businesses often struggle to generate a profit and are always in danger of falling out of favour once the next big thing comes along.\n\u00a35bn man: Snapchat founder\u00a0Evan Spiegel with his model fiancee Miranda kerr\nJeremy Gleeson, manager of the Axa Framlington Global Technology fund, says: \u2018Initially two main factors determine how a tech company does when it lists: the level of hype and the price.\u00a0\n'If you get those right, you have a successful IPO. Once the excitement dies down and the results come through, the share price will start to be based on the actual business.\u2019\nTwo recent examples are Facebook and Twitter. Facebook floated in May 2012 at a meaty $38 a share.\u00a0\nThere was a lot of hype and a raft of concerns about whether the firm could actually monetise its business.\nGleeson held off from investing when it listed, cautious about its profitability and how a shift from desktop computers to mobile phones would work.\nBy the end of August shares had more than halved to just $18. This was the point at which Gleeson invested.\u00a0\nShares are now $137. It\u2019s the third largest holding in his fund, which has return 56 per cent over the past year.\nIn contrast, Twitter seemed set to succeed when it listed 18 months later in November 2013.\u00a0\nGleeson says the firm looked to have learned from Facebook\u2019s mistakes by listing at a more sensible price of $26.\nThe stock soared, reaching $69 by January. But Twitter was struggling to monetise the business and growth in new users eased off. Today shares are around $16 \u2013 a fall of more than 75 per cent from their peak.\nGleeson has never invested but has had success with other technology IPOs, though, such as hand-held video camera firm GoPro.\u00a0\n\u2018I met the chief executive and I went out the same day and bought a GoPro. We had such fun with it on a family holiday. I loved how simple the video editing was that I bought shares.\u2019\nThe stock listed at $24 a share in June 2014 and he sold when they reached almost $90 just a few months later in October.\u00a0\nSince then, demand for the stock has tapered off. Shares are now back down to just $9.50.\nGleeson also invested in wearable fitness tracker device Fitbit when it listed on the stock exchange at $20 in June 2015.\nShares peaked around $47 but Gleeson sold the stock when the Apple watch was launched, fearing the competition could be too stiff. Shares are now $5.90.\nNow experts have to decide whether Snapchat will soar or stumble.\u00a0\nAlready high profile investors including pension fund giant Royal London have said they will not be backing the business. Gleeson, too, will be watching from the sidelines.\nWhile Snapchat users typically engage with the app up to 18 times a day, they typically only use it for 90 seconds at a time, which may not be enough for advertisers.\u00a0\nSnapchat needs to prove it can make money and to price itself sensibly.\u00a0\nTOP DIY INVESTING PLATFORMS\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-24T20:58:22Z", "images": []}

Apple typically acknowledges ongoing outages on its System Status site with a brief description of the problem, and this week Apple has updated its design to emphasize last known issues.\nPreviously, Apple\u2019s System Status page focused on showing the current state of iCloud and related services while previous outages were detailed on a timeline at the bottom of the page.

The launch will include two \u201cS\u201d cycle devices, perhaps called the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. According to\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal \u00a0(paywall), it will also include a\u00a0third, higher-end iPhone that may\u00a0look markedly\u00a0different from its predecessors.\nAs others have hinted at recently, an iPhone may be released this year with a curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen, which provides brighter, more vivid colors than Apple\u2019s usual\u00a0liquid-crystal displays\u00a0(LCD). The Journal reports that the\u00a0new screen will be produced by Samsung, and will only feature on the third, high-end iPhone\u2014there aren\u2019t enough screen suppliers to build all three models. (The company generally sells between 40 and 70 million phones a quarter.)\nIt\u2019s not clear\u00a0how else this luxury\u00a0iPhone may\u00a0differentiate itself, but it\u2019s expected \u00a0to\u00a0cost around $1,000, well above the $650 and $750 starting price of\u00a0regular iPhones and iPhone Pluses. What\u00a0these\u00a0curved screens will actually look like, and whether they\u2019ll be markedly different from Samsung\u2019s own phones with curved screens (such as the Galxaxy S7 Edge and the fateful Note 7), or be more than just a gimmick, is also unclear.\nThat the next iPhone looks\u00a0different and\u00a0costs more could be intriguing enough for some consumers. The iPhone 7, which offered significant internal upgrades over the last iPhone, was\u00a0 criticized \u00a0by many reviewers for looking identical to it, and the model\u00a0before it. \u201cAnalysts say Chinese consumers feel more motivated to buy a new phone when it has a different look that gives it appeal as a status symbol,\u201d the Journal\u2019s\u00a0Takashi Mochizuki says.\nOn\u00a0all forthcoming iPhone\u00a0models, there may be\u00a0frustrating changes ahead: The new generation will apparently charge via USB-C cable, eschewing the Lightning charging cable that Apple introduced for its mobile devices five years ago. Apple recently replaced all the ports on its new\u00a0laptops with USB-C ports, so\u00a0bringing the iPhone to the USB-C standard makes sense. Unfortunately, it also renders just about every accessory and cable sold\u00a0over the last five years useless. (Confusingly, Apple\u2019s brand-new AirPods wireless headphones require\u00a0a Lightning cable.)\nNone of the\u00a0three\u00a0new phones will have a\u00a0home button, according to the\u00a0Journal.\u00a0This\u00a0isn\u2019t that a surprise, given that current iPhones don\u2019t have physical buttons, just touch-sensitive\u00a0areas that\u00a0triggers certain actions. The next iPhones will be flush across the front, with a \u201cfunction area\u201d that you can tap below the main screen, according to MacRumors . Apple wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment on these reports.\nAll these updates may help the phones resist water and fit better in Apple\u2019s hardware ecosystem, but they\u00a0do leave one wondering about their\u00a0benefits. Every iPhone, and just about every other flagship smartphone on the market , is a pocket supercomputer with\u00a0tons of space, beautiful screens, and excellent cameras.\u00a0Samsung has had curved OLED screens for a few years now\u2014to the point where it\u2019s the only company that can supply Apple the amount it needs. It also has wireless charging, tiny phone-mounted styluses, and all sorts of other inventions.\u00a0So while\u00a0Apple\u2019s hardware has always been the highest quality, ten years after the launch of the first iPhone, is it still leading the market?\nApple traditionally announces new iPhones in September. However, the first iPhone was announced in January 2007 and released over the summer, so perhaps in this anniversary\u00a0year, we\u2019ll see what a $1,000 iPhone looks like a little sooner.\nTags\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-28T17:09:56Z", "images": []}

Last October, it bought Dutch firm Innoluce BV to corner the lidar market.\n'It is incredibly difficult to pick out who will be the winner in the driverless vehicle race,' says Mr Unwin.\n'There are so many competing technologies from various different companies, but Infineon has had a good run the past two years or so.'\nWhile small start-ups are making huge strides, Silicon Valley giants Apple and Google have the deepest pockets to research driverless technology \u2014 and buy firms that make breakthroughs.\nMr Unwin invests \u00a318 in every \u00a3100 of his Neptune Global Technology fund in Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent firm.\nGoogle has been developing this technology within its Waymo division since 2009.\nIt is taking Uber and the self-driving truck creator Otto to court over accusations that they copied the ideas.\nApple's interest in the sector came to light in December last year in a secret letter to the U.S. highways regulator in which it said it was 'excited' about automated cars.\nThe iPhone creator is rumoured to have a 1,000-strong team working on automated car technology in a secret lab in California.\nThe Polar Capital Technology Trust \u2014 which has turned \u00a310,000 into \u00a316,900 over the past five years \u2014 also invests heavily in the two firms, which account for nearly \u00a315 in every \u00a3100 of its savers' cash.\nJeremy Gleeson, who runs the AXA WF Framlington Robotech, which was launched last month, has money in car parts manufacturer Delphi.\nIts Roadrunner driverless vehicle completed a 3,400-mile journey from San Francisco to New York in just nine days in 2015.\nThe car used collision-warning technology provided by Israeli technology firm Mobileye, another firm in which the fund has money.\n'Car manufacturers around the world will need more of this technology, so we're targeting companies which will benefit from this,' says Mr Gleeson.\np.thomas@dailymail.co.uk\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-02-28T22:01:15Z", "images": []}

{"title": "A fashion expert just nailed why smartwatches have never really caught on", "content": "A fashion expert just nailed why smartwatches have never really caught on\nAvery Hartmans\nAdam Dachis, Flickr\nAt this point, it\u2019s safe to say that smartwatches aren\u2019t catching on.\nDespite years of development, new software updates , new hardware , and partnerships with fashion brands , smartwatches haven\u2019t hit the mainstream after roughly three years of wide availability. In fact, they have barely even conquered the tech community.\nSo, why is that?\nThe New York Times\u2019 Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and critic, summed it up succinctly in a recent Times\u2019 interview about personal tech. When asked whether smartwatches are ever going to replace normal watches, she replied (emphasis ours):\nI am sure they will be at some point, but who knows when that will be? The problem is they just look too much like gadgets \u2014 or like wannabe traditional watches. Someone has to come up with a third paradigm. Then whoever does that will be in clover.\nWhat Friedman is saying is that smartwatches haven\u2019t caught on yet because we haven\u2019t actually invented the right product.\nNo one knows what they\u2019re for\nThere are concrete issues with smartwatches that cause buyers to quickly tire of their watches, or hold people back from buying them in the first place. Prices for some of the top watches on the market \u2014 Apple Watch and Google\u2019s new LG watches \u2014 start at $US249 and can reach up to $US1,249 for Apple\u2019s ceramic Edition model. And once customers shell out for the watch, battery issues tend to plague those who wear it every day, since most smartwatches last for less than 24 hours before needing to be charged up again.\nPlus, the interface remains a problem on watchOS and Android Wear alike. Trying to use the watch as a tiny touchscreen phone remains challenging, not-quite-intuitive, and error-prone.\nThose issues are likely contributing to the smartwatch industry\u2019s flat growth. Last December, eMarketer, a research firm, slashed its estimates of people using wearable technology . Just 39.5 million American adults used a wearable at least monthly in 2015, it estimated \u2014 versus its previous forecast for the year of 63.7 million.\nHollis Johnson\nThe Apple Watch Series 2.\nOverall, eMarketer estimated that the market grew 24.7%, versus its prediction of 60%, and a boom isn\u2019t right around the corner, either: In 2016, 15.8% of Americans use smartwatches \u2014 by 2020, eMarketer predicts that number will only have grown to 21.1%.\n\u201cWithout a clear use case for smart watches \u2014 which have more features than fitness trackers, but significant overlap with smartphone functionality \u2014 the more sophisticated, expensive devices have not caught on as quickly as expected,\u201d eMarketer analyst Cathy Boyle told Business Insider last year.\nThe problem is that companies making smartwatches can\u2019t quite figure out what they should be: should they replace fitness trackers, cell phones, or simply behave like normal wristwatches with a few tech features built in? This confuses people, and it makes them not want to buy.\nA third paradigm\nThis confusion among the smartwatch market is clearly exemplified by the smartwatches on sale right now. On one hand, you have the Apple Watch, which is practically a bat signal that you\u2019re a nerd with money to burn. Those who have it apparently love it , but there are plenty of people who bought one and have stopped using it, not to mention an entire subset of people would wouldn\u2019t be caught dead with one on their wrist.\nA prime example: Last Christmas, when my dad was considering buying my older sister an Apple Watch, she begged me to steer him in another direction. While touched that he wanted to buy her such a nice gift, she told me (in effect) that she thought she\u2019d never be asked out while wearing an Apple Watch.\nHollis Johnson\nGoogle\u2019s LG Watch Style.\nIn contrast to the Apple Watch, LG last month released the LG Watch Style , a smartwatch disguised as a regular wristwatch. It\u2019s sleek, minimalist, and it doesn\u2019t scream \u201cI have a 512 MB RAM on my wrist.\u201d It is the essence of the \u201cwannabe traditional watch\u201d Friedman describes.\nWhile I was initially impressed with the LG Watch Style specifically for its fashion sense, I confess that I lost interest in it after a few days and it went back in its box.\nThe reality is, most tech companies don\u2019t know enough about fashion to create something people will actually want to wear, and most fashion brands don\u2019t know enough about technology to build a device worth owning. The result is smartwatches that are both confused and confusing, which only add to the surfeit of devices we already carry around.\nSo what\u2019s the solution? Maybe it\u2019s the \u201cthird paradigm\u201d that Friedman suggests: a wearable that is neither watch nor gadget, and somehow combines both usefulness and style. It would have to be something that appeals to the tech-obsessed, the fashionable, and everyone in between, and contains only the features you need and none of the things you don\u2019t. Whoever figures that out will be, as Friedman says, \u201cin clover.\u201d\nGet the latest Google stock price here.\nNOW WATCH: Tech Insider videos\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-01T22:09:11Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Apple and Samsung are set to reignite the fanboy wars", "content": "Matt Burns @mjburnsy / 2 years\nThe latest rumors put Apple and Samsung on a direct collision course. If they pan out, the next iPhone and Galaxy will look very similar with curved screens and thin bezels. But then there\u2019s the price. One option is going up market, while the other will probably stay mainstream.\nOnce upon a time Samsung blatantly copied Apple to the point the courts agreed and forced Samsung to pay $399 million in damages thought the two are still going at it .\nThis time around, though, it sounds like Apple will be the company directly following Samsung\u2019s lead as the available technology converges on obvious conclusions.\nSharpen the pitchforks and fletch the arrows. The fanboy wars are about to flare back up.\niPhone rumors have surfaced over the past weeks describing a phone with a curved OLED screen and the lack of a physical home button. With those features, there\u2019s only a few ways to design a phone and most roads lead to something that looks like this leaked image of the Galaxy S8.\nThe design would not likely be an exact photocopy. Apple will make the iPhone look like an iPhone. I would expect the next iPhone to have a bit more squared-off corners. Don\u2019t expect a 3.5mm jack like the Galaxy S8 is rumored to sport; Apple is committed to wireless headphones and is not looking back.\nThe camera placement on the next iPhone could be dictated by the new curved screen, as well. Since the first iPhone, the rear-facing camera has always been housed in the top left of the back panel. This was in part made possible by housing the camera behind the large bezel that matched the size of the bottom bezel where the home button is located. If Apple is doing away with the home button, there will not be a need for a large bezel on the bottom so Apple could reduce the size of the top bezel as well. With a smaller top bezel, there will be less room to house the internal camera components and this could force Apple to either employ a larger camera bump or move the location of the camera to the middle of the backside \u2014 like where most Android phones have their camera lending more credence to the notion Apple is following the lead of Android phones.\nThere is just little Apple will be able to do to make the next iPhone look much different from the next Galaxy phone if the rumored specs are correct.\nThe physical size of the upcoming devices could be different, though. Mobile device makers are playing with screen aspect ratios in an attempt to make large phones a bit more usable in the hand. LG recently unveiled the G6 at Mobile World Congress. The company is marketing the screen on the phone as 18:9 (so 2:1). It\u2019s twice as wide as it is tall . It feels slightly different and at first blush, does appear to make the phone more comfortable to hold. The leaked image of the Galaxy S8 shows a device that looks similar in stature.\nWith the curved screen, Samsung, or even Apple, will be able to design a phone that has a larger screen than past models but is relatively smaller in the hand. If these companies use even a slightly different aspect ratios the Galaxy S8 and iPhone X could have a radically different feel even if they have similar design traits.\nIt might come down to price. The WSJ reported yesterday that Apple is readying a special edition of the next iPhone to celebrate the device\u2019s 10 year anniversary. This is the device rumored to have the curved screen. And The Journal is reporting it will cost $1,000. That\u2019s $350 over the price of an iPhone 7 and $200 more than the price of the Samsung S7 edge. And if Samsung keeps with its pricing scheme the S8 edge will be priced similarly to the S7 edge, putting the iPhone at a different price point even though the design and specs are rumored to be similar.\nBoth companies could drop surprises when they announce their upcoming devices. Storage capacity and camera capabilities could set the next iPhone and Galaxy devices apart. One could have novel battery or charging feature, too. Or there\u2019s casing material too. Apple could ditch a metal exterior for something more exotic like glass or ceramic. Samsung might use something different from glass for the S8. But options aside, fanboys often disregard specs and focus on design aspects and from the sounds of it, both devices will looks the same.\nSamsung is set to announce the next Galaxy phone at a special New York City event on March 29th. Apple traditionally announces new iPhones in September. By announcing its phone much earlier, Samsung fans will no doubt have plenty of ammo to support the attack that Apple is following Samsung\u2019s lead. Just never mind the fact companies often start designing devices years in advance \u2014 logic is not allowed in a fanboy war.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-01T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

But despite a record quarter for Apple, it\u2019s clear that number two Xiaomi has managed to significantly widen the gap between itself and Apple in third position. Xiaomi posted the biggest gains with a 96.2% year-over-year growth in the quarter and 5.2 million units shipped, bumping Apple from the number two position it held in the fourth quarter in 2015.\nGrowth for both Apple and Xiaomi comes as market leader Fitbit posted a -22.7% decline with 6.5 million units shipped versus 8.4 million in the year ago quarter. In its Q4 earnings results , Fitbit said it \u201cexperienced softer-than-expected holiday demand for trackers in our most mature markets, especially during Black Friday.\u201d IDC notes that its numbers for Fitbit sales also includes shipments of Pebble and Vector smartwatches.\nThe top three spots are followed by Garmin in fourth posting a -4% decline with 2.1 million units shipped, and Samsung in fifth with 38% year-over-year growth and 1.9 million units shipped thanks to the launch of its newest wearables.\u00a0\nWhile Apple doesn\u2019t break out specifics for Apple Watch sales, it did say it achieved record numbers for both units and revenue during the important holiday period.\nLooking at 2015 versus last year, IDC highlights Apple\u2019s sales for 2016 were down slightly from 11.6 million units to 10.7 million, while Xiaomi grew from 12 million units in 2015 to 15.7 million last year and Fitbit posted a small gain, up approximately half a million units.\nAs a whole, the wearable market grew to an all-time high of 33.9 million units in Q4 representing 16.9% year-over-year growth.

{"title": "Why Apple won\u2019t ditch Lightning for USB-C in the next iPhone", "content": "Opinion\nWhy Apple won\u2019t ditch Lightning for USB-C in the next iPhone\nApple has a history of abandoning older technologies for new standards, but don\u2019t count on that this year\nEmail a friend\nUse commas to separate multiple email addresses\nFrom\nYour message has been sent.\nSorry\n| Mar 2, 2017 11:06 AM PT\nCurrent Job Listings\nSpeculation about Apple's plans for its next iPhone, due out this fall, has been building in the last few weeks, with attention focused on everything from the prospect of wireless charging to OLED displays and now, the possibility Apple might dump the phone's Lightning connector for USB-C.\nThat last prospect was highlighted this week by the Wall Street Journal , which also predicted Apple would source OLED screens for the new iPhone from Samsung.\nWhile Apple might well be planning to introduce OLED displays, eliminating the Lightning connector and replacing it with USB-C won't happen. Here's my thinking.\nHow Apple operates\nThe decisions Apple makes when designing new products are always scrutinized, which means when it comes to aesthetics and technologies, there is always something to nitpick. As Apple moves to minimize appearance and ornamentation -- the result of its ongoing focus on mobility in smaller, lighter, and thinner devices -- traditional features get the axe. Most recently, with the arrival of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus last year , Apple did away with the traditional headphone jack -- moving that feature to the Lightning port and causing consternation among Apple users.\nOver the years, the variety of physical connections available on Apple products has dwindled, meaning that the ports and connections that remain must, by default, take on new duties. This is especially true for Apple's laptops, which over the years have lost a variety of ports, including everything from Ethernet to USB 1.0, SD card slots and Apple-specific power ports like Mag-Safe.\nIn Apple's latest laptops, the MacBook and MacBook Pro, they've all been replaced by USB-C ports -- a move that last year prompted an outcry from Mac users annoyed that they would need new cables and dongles to connect older hardware . (At least the newest laptops still have the traditional headphone jack. Yay?)\nWith Apple's clear interest in USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, it's no surprise that speculation would arise that the company might turn to it for the upcoming iPhone. USB-C, as implemented in Apple's hardware, is versatile, provides power to the laptop, allows for fast data transfer speeds for external storage drives and can even \u00a0drive multiple monitors.\nDespite the Wall Street Journal report, I'm willing to bet a lot of money that the next generation iPhone (as well as any new iPads and iPod touch devices rolled out this year) will retain the now-traditional Lightning connection.\nWhy Lighting isn't going away\nThere are a variety of reasons I believe this, chief among them: compatibility with existing products and Lightning's relatively recent arrival as a replacement for the old 30-pin connector.\nBut the main reason is simple;\u00a0It's about keeping control and making money.\nApple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs once said: \"I've always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do.\" While CEO Tim Cook hasn't always followed the path set by his predecessor, who died in 2011, in this case control does play an integral role in what Apple will do.\nAs of the iPhone 7 series, released last September, the Lightning connection is the only way to physically plug in another device to the phone. Do you really believe that Apple will give up control over the single existing physical connection to its most popular device -- especially when Apple holds all of the access keys to said connection ?\nThe Lightning connector is proprietary for Apple. It brings in good money via licensing fees, since if you need to physically connect to an i-Device, you have no choice but to use Lightning. Apple execs aren't going to walk away from that advantage. Lightning is also relatively new -- it's only been around since 2012. And having largely moved third-party manufacturers to it Apple isn't about to force them to move to USB-C. Doing so would mean giving up control and cost the company money at the same time. (I'm not the only one to push back on the Journal report .\nNow, that doesn't mean Apple won't give the wall adapter for the next iPhone the USB-C treatment, which means devices would ship with a USB-C-to-Lightning cord like the one the MacBook Pro uses now. But the iPhone (and iPad and iPod touch) will keep the Lightning port.\nYou can make an argument for a straight USB-C connection on an iPhone or iPad -- standardization across Apple's devices stands out, for instance. But the advantages of retaining full control over the only physical connection on Apple's best-selling and most profitable piece of hardware outweighs any such move this year or for the foreseeable future.\nYour Lightning-based iPhone accessories and cables are safe. Apple will not cede its role as gatekeeper to a gold mine.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-02T16:06:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Safari browser sheds users, mimicking IE", "content": "Computerworld\nSafari browser sheds users, mimicking IE\nChrome most likely beneficiary of 19% decline in share of Apple's browser\nGregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 04 March, 2017 02:12\n-\nApple's Safari browser, like rival Internet Explorer (IE), has lost a significant number of users in the last two years, data published Wednesday showed.\nThe most likely destination of Safari defectors: Google's Chrome.\nAccording to California-based analytics vendor Net Applications, in March 2015, an estimated 69% of all Mac owners used Safari to go online. But by last month, that number had dropped to 56%, a drop of 13 percentage points -- representing a decline of nearly a fifth of the share of two years prior.\nIt was possible to peg the percentage of Mac users who ran Safari only because that browser works solely on macOS, the Apple operating system formerly labeled OS X. The same single-OS characteristic of IE and Edge has made it possible in the past to determine the percentage of Windows users who run those browsers.\n[ Further reading: Microsoft continues to bleed browser share at record rates ]\nNet Applications measures user share by sniffing the browser user agent string of visitors to its customers' websites, then tallying the various browsers and OSes.\nSafari's share erosion was much less than that suffered by Microsoft's browsers , particularly IE, during the same period. From March 2015 to February 2017, the use of Microsoft's IE and Edge on Windows personal computers plummeted. Two years ago, the browsers were run by 62% of Windows PC owners; last month, the figure had fallen by more than half, to just 27%.\nSimultaneous with the decline of IE has been the rise of Chrome. The user share of Google's browser -- its share of all browsers on all operating systems -- more than doubled in the last two years, jumping from 25% in March 2015 to 59.5% last month. Along the way, Chrome supplanted IE to become the world's most-used browser.\nIt's impossible to be certain, but Chrome was probably the beneficiary from Safari's user share decline as well. In the last 24 months, Mozilla's Firefox -- the other major browser alternative to Chrome for macOS users -- has barely budged, losing just two-tenths of a percentage point in user share.\nThe downturn of both IE and Safari expose the fragility of what was once thought to be their biggest advantage: That they were bundled with their respective operating systems. Because they came with the operating system -- Windows in IE's case, OS X and now macOS in Safari's -- their position was believed unassailable; users, it was thought, would largely use what they were given, rather than seek out alternatives.\nMicrosoft became the agent of IE's destruction when the company unexpectedly called for the retirement of most versions of the browser , and told customers they must upgrade to IE11. Faced with that, many instead simply deserted to Chrome.\nApple did not make that same mistake, so reasons for Safari's decline are muddier. One possibility: Those who used both Windows and OS X/macOS -- perhaps one at work, the other at home -- may have shifted to the common denominator of Chrome for the convenience of bookmark and password synchronization. Under that theory, a small increase of Chrome on OS X/macOS was simply a side effect of the much larger rise of Chrome on Windows.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-04T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

What\u2019s it made of? Is it Bluetooth-connected? Does it play mood music? And at $US74 a pop, is it reusable?\nWell, based on what we know so far, the Fitbit of f\u2014\u2013g seems more like a gimmick than a useful tool.\nThe rig sits over a condom at the base of the penis shaft and uses \u201ca nano-chip and sensors\u201d to measure and record the specs of your lovemaking session. There are no photos of the device itself yet, so we have no idea how comfortable it is to wear for either partner.\nOnce the steam clears, the ring bearer can download the data to the i.Con app over a Bluetooth connection. Users have the option to share their metrics\u00a0with friends or the public, so they can see how their bedroom-skills \u2014 and even girth \u2014 stacks up against i.Con users worldwide.\nThe iCon website proudly declares, \u201cThe future of your sex life starts here.\u201d It\u2019s a definite stretch, considering the wearable makes no attempts to improve pleasure, prevent condom breakages and the passage of sexual diseases, or do anything else that is remotely useful.\nLELO\nThe real \u2018condom of the future\u2019 launched in 2016.\nIn 2016, Swedish intimacy company LELO launched a condom that has a hexagonal pattern etched into the material. It makes it less likely to slip or tear, according to the company. The condom shattered its crowdfunding goal when it raised over $US1 million from 30,000 backers through crowdfunding on Indiegogo and its website. It sells for $US19.90 for a 12-pack.\nThe company \u00a0behind the i.Con is waiting to launch pre-orders until it reaches a hard shipment date, but says it\u00a0has received over 96,000 \u201cpre-registrations\u201d \u00a0for the product. While a picture of the i.Con\u2019s box shows an Apple App Store logo, there was no sign of the app in the store at the time this was published. And considering Apple\u2019s strict and straight-laced\u00a0standards for apps, it\u2019s unclear whether the smart condom app will ever get approved by Apple.\nThe so-called Smart Condom from i.Con got mixed reactions on Twitter.\nMost people poked fun at the goofy device.\nOthers offered their feedback for how the i.Con Smart Condom can be improved.\nAnd this woman spoke her truth.\n2018 we jumping into DM\u2019s with Smart Condom stats.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-03T22:50:52Z", "images": []}

Previously, the Financial Times reported that Apple had entered into talks with Ron Howard\u2019s Imagine Entertainment.\nThese talks could\u2019ve taken place last month, when Apple CEO Tim Cook and Cue were in LA to attend both the Oscars and the Grammys.\nBut most interestingly, the Post\u2019s sources say Apple hasn\u2019t figured out who\u2019s leading the negotiations: sometimes it\u2019s Cue, sometimes it\u2019s their longtime lieutenant Robert Kondrk, and sometimes it\u2019s Jimmy Iovine, founder of Beats and music industry heavyweight. He doesn\u2019t have a title at Apple \u2014 it\u2019s just \u201cJimmy.\u201d\nThe Post\u2019s Claire Atkinson writes:\nAs Apple executives are busying looking to do business in Hollywood, entertainment industry insiders are scratching their heads over who, exactly, is driving the effort.\n\u201cRobert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,\u201d one insider told The Post. \u201cThey each want to be the guy, and they\u2019re telling people, don\u2019t deal with the other one.\u201d\nThat sounds messy, and it\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve heard about this type of confusion in Apple.\nLast year, in an article about Apple Music\u2019s redesign and music content negotiations, Bloomberg reported :\nWhile Iovine\u2019s connections make him valuable, they\u2019re also a source of friction inside Apple. There were times when they were in the middle of negotiations with an artist\u2019s managers and labels while, unbeknownst to them, Iovine was carrying out his own separate discussions, according to people familiar with the matter.\nApple has long wanted to release a standout TV product, most likely along with a TV subscription service, but it has been stymied in negotiations with content producers before.\nBut Apple has made smaller bets on TV shows, including \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke,\u201d which will launch on Apple Music, Apple\u2019s music subscription service.\nCurrently, Apple TV, an internet-connected streaming box that plugs into TVs through an HDMI port, is seeing year-over-year declines in sales.\nDuring Apple\u2019s most recent earnings call, Cook gave some colour on the company\u2019s original content ambitions:\n\u201cIn terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year.

{"title": "Putting the right foot forward when a stranger calls", "content": "Australia has no major 3D printing industry to speak of.\nCredit:Bloomberg\nGans and Docherty had been placed in the same living group. What Gans didn't know when making his presentation was that, back in Melbourne, a successful medical supply business had been scouring the world for a 3D printing solution for years. That business is called Orthokids, and it makes crucial orthotics for children and infants, assisting with conditions ranging from hip dysplasia to cerebral palsy. The owner of Orthokids is Ken Shaw, who has been a friend of Paul Docherty for more than two decades.\n\"Here I am, listening to this presentation, and my mind is already thinking of Australia,\" Docherty recalls.\nEach Orthokids orthotic is custom made and hand-fitted in a small workshop. The process is costly, time-consuming and invasive for many children, who must have plaster casts and moulds taken of parts of their body. To try to cut the waiting list and manufacturing costs, Shaw had spent years investigating 3D printing, but to no avail. Now his mate of 25 years was sharing living quarters with a man who might have answers.\n\"I called Ken straight away and said, 'hey, I've got this guy in my living group, and he's president of a 3D printing company, what's going on with 3D?' Ken told me he had spoken to people all over the world, and been told the solution to his problems were still five years away.\"\nMuch like Fernandez all those years ago, Docherty decided to put two strangers in touch.\n\"Ken had been looking for a solution to his problems, and I had accidentally tripped over the man who could have answers in my class at Harvard, and together we thought we would have a go a solving it,\" Docherty says.\nLess than a year since Gilan Gans set foot in Australia, 3DMEDiTech is on the verge of establishing its central manufacturing hub.\nCredit:Meredith O'Shea\nIt took Gans, Docherty and Shaw a little under four months to invent a new manufacturing process using 3D printers, and the company 3D Meditech was born.\nInstead of taking casts, children as young as three months old can now be scanned. \"We put a child on a revolving table, it's kind of like a lazy susan in a Chinese restaurant,\" Docherty laughs. \"We turn the kid around for 30 seconds, take a scan and baby can move and it doesn't matter. We apply that data to the 3D modelling that has been developed by our little team in Tel Aviv, and make sure we have the right materials.\"\nFrom there, a precise orthotic can be 3D printed, with almost no need for adjustment and refitting. \"There are huge amounts of labour that are saved, but it's more than that. The process for many kids to have orthotics fitted is so difficult and expensive that many parents decide against it, especially if their child is not severely impacted. We have made the process so much less invasive and difficult for the child that more parents can choose to get an orthotic fitted.\"\nWaiting lists for some orthotics can be three or four months. For certain conditions, a small window of three to nine months exists for the orthotic to work. \"With the 3D printing, we can very quickly turn these around,\" Docherty says.\nLess than a year since Gans first set foot in Australia, 3D Meditech is on the verge of establishing its central manufacturing hub. He and Docherty are partners in the venture, and the company is fully funded, having sold a stake to global venture capital firm ICM Group last year, which has $US17 billion under management.\nOrthotics are just one of many products in the medical space that 3DMeditech is capable of manufacturing. The company is cashed up and ready to go, and it's Docherty's desire to have that facility in Melbourne. Sadly, however, like with so many Australian inventions, the jobs could end up overseas. It's not government red tape or high wages that are the issue.\nIt's the simple fact that Australia has no major 3D printing industry to speak of. It means the ecosystem 3D Meditech needs to operate does not exist in Australia.\n\"Given the state of manufacturing in Victoria, we think this is an important development,\" Docherty says. \"We can create a 3D printing hub, but to get there we need to deal with a number of issues. These include a supply chain for the raw materials, the qualified staff, the manufacturing and servicing of the machines themselves, the financing of those machines.\n\"All of those things we simply don't have in Victoria, but they could exist. In other parts of the world there is already a secondary market for 3D printing, but in Australia we don't have that yet.\"\nDespite the road blocks, Docherty is keen to push on and make Melbourne the home of 3DMeditech. The company has already started engaging with federal health regulators, such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration.\n\"There is so much to be proud of in Australia,\" Docherty says.\n\"We are really good at research and development. At prototyping. Organisations such as the CSIRO, Melbourne University, St Vincent's Health, in all of these institutions there are Australians doing some unbelievable things. But we also want to manufacture here. We are proud that we can do this in Australia, create high-tech manufacturing jobs in the current climate. Given our location in the world and population, short-run manufacturing seems to be the smart place to be. I think we can do it.\"\nLet's hope so. 3D Meditech is ready to start manufacturing, and Singapore is looming as an alternative manufacturing hub if obstacles cannot be overcome.\nMelbourne's loss could soon be Singapore's gain.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-03T13:03:50Z", "images": []}

Two are successors to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but one model will be completely redesigned, and could cost over $US1,000.\nThat last one is the phone Apple fans will probably want \u2014 the \u201c10th anniversary\u201d iPhone, with a better \u201cOLED\u201d screen, redesigned fingerprint sensor, and likely other cutting-edge technologies that haven\u2019t even been rumoured yet.\nBut it now sounds like it could release later than September. Multiple supply chain watchers in recent weeks have said they believe production on the \u201cOLED iPhone\u201d will not start until September, which suggests the high-end iPhone \u201c8\u201d may not go on sale in September, as has been the case for years.\nApple traditionally needs months of production to accommodate the launch demand for its new iPhones, which can sell millions on its first weekend of availability.\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is famous for accurately predicting Apple\u2019s plans, mentioned this in a research note focusing on Apple\u2019s camera suppliers dated February 24 (emphasis ours):\n\u201cAfter 1-2 years spent on related-component R&D, OLED iPhone to feature proprietary 3D camera system; three modules of 3D camera system to be calibrated precisely via active alignment. In keeping with Apple\u2019s stringent quality standards, we believe:\n(1) related optical components, including VCSEL, DOE, wafer-level lens and filter for IR transmitting module, and CIS, filter and lens of IR receiver module have all been custom-designed in collaboration with suppliers;\n\u2026\nThis implies, unless production of the OLED iPhone (expected to begin in September) gets pushed back, there is virtually no time to make changes to the 3D camera system, either on a parts or module level, given the lengthy review and recertification processes that would be required.\u201d\nOn Friday, electronics supply chain trade publication Digitimes backed up Kuo\u2019s research :\nApple\u2019s in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC\u2019s 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, said the sources, adding that production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution.\n\u2026\nApple is expected to enter volume production for two other new iPhones, which will retain LCD for their displays, in July, the sources said.\nThis raises the possibility that Apple could debut all three devices in September, as it usually does, but only release the two iPhone 7 successors shortly thereafter, forcing customers to wait for the high-end iPhone 8.\nThe last time Apple launched an iPhone outside of the September month was in 2011, when the iPhone 4S launched in October.\nHere\u2019s what we think we know about the fabled \u201cOLED iPhone,\u201d which analysts have been calling the \u201ciPhone 8\u201d or \u201ciPhone X.\u201d\nThere will be three new iPhone models, and all three could have wireless charging.\nThe highest-end iPhone, with a \u201cOLED\u201d screen with deeper blacks, could have a casing made of \u201cforged stainless steel\u201d and a back made of glass.\nThe home button and fingerprint sensor could be built into and under an edge-to-edge screen on the high-end model.\nIt will sport a double-lens camera, like on the iPhone 7 Plus.\nIt will feature new 3D-sensing technology to enable \u201csome form of facial/gesture recognition.\u201d\nEXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-03T15:54:21Z", "images": []}

It was founded on April 1, 1976 by Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nWayne, who after just 12 days as a founder sold his shares to Wozniak for $US800 and had his name removed from the company, is not pictured in the collage.\nMarkulla invested the first $US250,000 -- the cheque he gave to Jobs is pictured in the collage -- of venture capital money into Apple, its first proper funding.\nWozniak and Jobs met whilst working for Hewlett-Packard in 1971. Wozniack was still in college and Jobs was still in high school.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nIn 1977, the two Steves moved out of the Jobs' family garage to the company's first official corporate address, 20863 Stevens Creek Blvd., (Building 3, Suite C) in Cupertino, California. Apple still owns this office.\nTwo early Apple employees, Bob Martinengo and Mark Johnson, spoke to Business Insider about what it was like working with the two Steves back in the days when nobody knew what Apple was.\nBoth Jobs and Wozinak went to Homestead High School in Cupertino, California, where Apple is headquartered.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nOver 40 years of Apple's products are pictured chronologically on a wall.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nApple's first computer, a naked circuit board called Apple 1 released in 1976, is the first product on display. Hand-built by Jobs and Wozniak, it was sold without a casing, power supply, keyboard, or monitor. Wozniak insisted its initial price be $666.66 because he reportedly liked triple digit numbers.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nAnd this is a giant version of the MOS 6502, the microprocessor used in the Apple I.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nWhen Apple was preparing to announce the Apple II in 1977, its VP of marketing at the time, Mike Markkula, sent a letter persuading dealers to stock and sell the company's second product. The letter, which placed great emphasis on how much Apple had spent on direct advertising for the Apple II, shows just how far back Apple's marketing efforts went.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nThe letter mentioned the fact that the Apple II required no assembly by the customer and could be 'up and running in ... minutes, not hours.'\nAnd here it is -- the fully assembled Apple II, released on April 16, 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco, California. It went on sale for up to $2,638, that's about $10,000 in today's value, and it was a huge success. Sales of the Apple II remained a significant part of revenue for the company well into the late 1980s.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nAn Apple II price list\nIt was also available as a circuit board only , without a keyboard, power supply, or case; the top computer lifts off with little effort.\nThis image from 1978 (not from the museum) shows the crew on the Apple II team, with the product in the background on a set of racks.

Johnson told us it was taken on a Friday, 'We were waiting for UPS to pick up the 57 Apple II computers that were completed,' he said.\nThe Apple II was successful in large part because it ran an app called VisiCalc, the first ever electronic spreadsheet that propelled the computer ahead of market leaders. With VisiCalc, Apple could sell the Apple II to the business customer.\nBusiness Insider spoke to the inventors of VisiCalc, Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston , and made this video .\nAnd it had superior colour graphics relative to anything else at the time, which prompted Jobs to add colours to the Apple logo in 1977.

A business-focused computer, it was supposed to compete with the growing threat of IBM and Microsoft. But it was largely considered Apple's first failure, thousands were recalled, but even after relaunching a new model in 1983, it was eventually abandoned.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nMuch has been written about why it failed so spectacularly but in sum, its design faults severely damaged Apple's reputation. The Apple III was the first Apple computer not designed by Wozniak.\nDespite the Apple III's failure, on December 12, 1980 Apple launched its IPO on NASDAQ. Selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share, it created about 300 millionaires. Jobs made $217 million dollars alone.

One of the very first things he did after replacing Amelio as CEO was kill the TAM -- a product costing $7,499 which he reportedly thought was a symbol of Apple's out-of-control excess and lack of focus.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nIf you paid the $US7,499 for the Twentieth Anniversary Mac , Apple would hand-deliver it via limo and set it up for you, in a full-on concierge experience.\nThe very first iMac was released a mere five months after the TAM was fully taken off the market in 1998. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n1997 would also see the introduction of Apple's famous 'Think Different' ad campaign celebrating famous artists, scientists, and musicians. The museum makes a spectacle of this campaign ...\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\n... and has a wall dedicated to portraits of the artists celebrated in the campaign.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nPretty much every computer in Apple's history is on display at the museum. Here's the 'Mac G3 All in one,' which was sometimes nicknamed the 'Molar Mac' because of its tooth-like shape.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nAnd here's the PowerBook G3. At the time of its introduction, it was advertised as the fastest notebook computer available.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nThe evolution of the iMac is impressive ...\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\n... 2002-2012.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nThis photo of the original iPod brings on pure nostalgia. Jobs introduced the first ever iPod in 2001 with the advertising slogan 'Say hello to iPod. 1,000 songs in your pocket.'\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nThe Apple Store didn't exist at the time, so the device was only helpful if you had loaded all of your CDs onto your computer.\nA history of iPods through time.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nBusiness Insider looked back at the evolution of the iPod in 2013, 12 years after its launch.\nAnd here's the Apple product that really changed the world. This iPhone prototype from 2007 is also on display in the museum. The product's design and emphasis on a touchscreen was unprecedented at the time. Jobs said that he was going to fire anyone who let the iPhone leak out before it launched.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\nA prototype of the first device was almost lost on a plane , according to former Apple executive and Nest founder Tony Fadell.\nIt also displayed a history of iPhone models through time.\nBusiness Insider / Hannah Roberts\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-05T00:00:12Z", "images": []}

Following is a transcript of the video.\nSteve Jobs in 2010 was on the stage at the Apple event releasing the iPad and he described it as a wonderful device that brought you educational tools. It allowed you to surf the web, it allowed you to watch videos, it allowed you to interact with other people. And he basically said it\u2019s the best way to do all those things.\nTwo years later when he was asked \u201cYour kids must love the iPad?\u201d He said \u201cActually we don\u2019t allow the iPad in the home. We think it\u2019s too dangerous for them in effect.\u201d The reason why he said that was because he recognised just how addictive the iPad was as a vehicle for delivering things to people. That once you had the iPad in front of you, or when you took it away from the home with you, you\u2019d always have access to these platforms that were very addictive. That were hard to resist.\nSo where his kids were very well adapted, well adjusted, may not have been prime targets for say substance abuse, they like everyone else, are susceptible to the charms of something like an iPad and what it delivers.\nEXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT:\n25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

{"title": "Microsoft's update shrinking reduces Windows 10 Insider betas by 65%", "content": "Computerworld\nMicrosoft's update shrinking reduces Windows 10 Insider betas by 65%\nBut smaller updates won't reach most users until the fall\nGregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 07 March, 2017 01:44\n-\nComments\nMicrosoft last week repeated its assertion that future Windows 10 feature upgrades will shrink in size later this year, and supported the claim with a smattering of data.\nThose running Windows 10's preview, labeled \"Insider,\" will see the largest reductions in download size, the data showed.\nMicrosoft\nWindows 10's new update delivery system reduces the size of downloads -- in this case by 65% for an Insider refresh (in green) -- compared to a full-install \"canonical\" update (in blue), by sending only what has changed since the last update.\nMicrosoft first touted smaller upgrades in November , when it trumpeted the \"Unified Update Platform\" (UUP), a new update delivery technology that it rolled out to participants in the Insider program a month later.\nBill Karagounis, director of program management, returned to the UUP topic Thursday in a post to a company blog . \"One of the biggest benefits UUP brings to our customers is a reduction in download size of build updates on PCs,\" Karagounis wrote.\n[ Further reading: Microsoft outlines IT tools in Windows 10 Creators Update ]\nRather than deliver every file necessary to assemble the upgrade prior to installation, UUP sends only what has changed since the last update or upgrade. The resulting package then uses files already on the local system -- copying those that were unchanged, building new files containing the changed code just downloaded -- to generate the installation.\nSuch change-only updates are often called \"delta\" or \"differential\" updates, and by nature are smaller than \"full\" upgrade packages, which include all files, not just those that have changed since the previous refresh.\nOther operating system makers already provide delta updates: Apple, for instance, offers differential updates for the macOS \"point\" releases during an edition's year-long lifecycle.\nBut until December, when Microsoft added UUP to the Insider releases, all updates and feature upgrades -- the former delivered every week or two, the latter once or twice yearly -- were full install packages that weighed in between 3GB and 4GB. With UUP in place, the size of a February 1 Insider update dropped to a median of just 910MB, 65% smaller than a February 8 full update, which Microsoft referred to as a \"canonical\" update, which tipped the download scale at a median of 2.56GB.\nNon-Insider users of Windows 10 won't see reductions that substantial, Karagounis said, again asserting that feature upgrades should shrink by about 35% under UUP's differential regime. Microsoft did not provide data to support that claim, however.\nThe difference between Karagounis' 35% contention and the 65% reduction illustrated by his post's accompanying chart stemmed from the fact that with less time between updates, as with the rapid Insider tempo, differences between before-and-after files are fewer, and thus the resulting download is smaller. Rather than differences measured in weeks, as between Insider releases, feature updates are separated by months.\nBecause UUP will be included in the upcoming \"Creators Update,\" the Windows 10 feature upgrade expected to ship this month or next, non-Insider customers won't see a download size savings until the next feature upgrade. That will probably appear in the fall.\nSmaller upgrade downloads will mean shorter retrieval times, and for those on metered connections, less of an impact on that month's allowance. But they will not reduce the amount of time the device is occupied with installing the upgrade, a sore spot with some users. Microsoft has announced other changes for the Creators Update to address some of those update and upgrade complaints .\nThe much smaller build-to-build delta updates of the Insider program may be a bigger boon to Microsoft. The company has pinned much of its testing on the Insider users, making it imperative that it attracts, then retains, the largest number of testers possible. Anything it does to make the program more convenient for members, or to address complaints, would be to its benefit.\nMicrosoft has hinted that it wants to boost the number of testers or change the composition of the pool. Last month, for example, Microsoft announced it would add features and tools to the Insider program that would target enterprise customers .\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "TomTom Banks on Partnerships to Help Drivers Escape Traffic Jams", "content": "Bloomberg\nTomTom Banks on Partnerships to Help Drivers Escape Traffic Jams\nBy\nMarch 7, 2017, 5:00 AM UTC\nTomTom Banks on Partnerships to Help Drivers Escape Traffic Jams\nBy\nMarch 7, 2017, 5:00 AM UTC\nDutch navigation specialist already works with Siemens and PTV\nTomTom has less cash than other companies building maps\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nTomTom NV wants to build more partnerships with infrastructure companies and cities as it carves out its role in a future where autonomous vehicles reduce consumer demand for satellite navigation devices.\nThe Amsterdam-based mapping company is already working on traffic management systems with engineering giant\nSiemens AG , roadworks monitoring company Elgin and transport planning specialist\nPTV AG , and is seeking more such tie-ups, Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn said in an interview.\nHarold Goddijn\nPhotographer: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg\n\u201cWe don\u2019t control the whole value chain, we don\u2019t do traffic lights, we don\u2019t do big traffic control centers, but we have a lot of smart technology,\u201d Goddijn said.\nTomTom and its peers have come into increasing focus as the automotive industry races to build autonomous vehicles. With carmakers wary about leaning on tech behemoths such as\nAlphabet Inc. \u2019s Google, they have instead turned to others to supply the mapping data essential to developing so-called self-driving cars. In 2015\nNokia Oyj sold its HERE mapping business to a consortium consisting of\nDaimler AG for 2.6 billion euros ($2.7 billion).\nAlternative Revenue\nTraffic management systems could become an attractive source of revenue. While at present they are used by cities to manage congestion by controlling traffic lights and other hardware to try to prevent blockages, the advent of autonomous driving means that centralized, cloud-based infrastructure management may play a greater role.\u00a0\nTomTom currently supplies that technology to places such as Berlin, Zurich and Amsterdam in many cases free of charge, which provides insight to local transport authorities. In return, the cities supply TomTom with traffic data it can use to improve its products, which it licenses to technology companies including\nUber Technologies Inc. \u00a0\nGoddijn said TomTom gets data from half a billion sources each day.\n\u201cUber is very much relying on our technology and our data for routing, for traffic information,\u201c\u00a0Goddijn said.\u00a0\u201cWe have a vast amount of data and experience, which helps them to tune their algorithms.\u201d\nCash, Headcount\nTomTom doesn\u2019t have the cash riches of other companies to pile into its mapping efforts. It had 144 million euros in cash and equivalents at the end of December. In contrast, chief rival in the satnav sector\nGarmin Ltd had $2.3 billion, Google had $92 billion and Apple had $246 billion. Apple last year opened an office in Hyderabad, India to focus on mapping, creating as many as 4,000 jobs in the city. TomTom\u2019s total headcount is 4,700, including 3,100 in R&D roles.\nTomTom is not alone in identifying traffic management as a growth opportunity. Panasonic Corp. has started testing its technology in Denver. Even as TomTom shifts away from selling the satellite navigation gear on which it has built its business, and moves toward data, software and services, it still generates half of its revenue from hardware.\nGoddijn is one of the co-founders and biggest shareholders of TomTom and said he has no desire to sell up. TomTom\u2019s four founders jointly own some 45 percent of the company.\u00a0\nTomTom shares trade at around 8 euros, and are still valued well below its all-time high closing price of 53.56 euros, reached in November 2007. It hopes to gain shareholder appreciation with its recently outlined strategy goals of growing its business to business enterprise at around a 15 percent compound annual rate between 2016 and 2020. TomTom\u2019s founders, including its current CEO, 25 years later are still the biggest shareholders, jointly owning some 45 percent.\n\u201cReally, I am here to run the show, and run this company as well as I can,\u201d Goddijn said. \u201cThat\u2019s my duty and eventually that will hopefully translate in a higher share price.\u201d\nWatch Next: What Will Trump\u2019s $1T Infrastructure Plan Look Like?\nPublished on\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Microsoft and Samsung have said they are \"looking into\" things, and now the Linux Foundation has spoken out.\nNicko van Someren, Chief Technology Officer at The Linux Foundation says that while it is \"not surprising\" that Linux would find itself a target, the open source project has a very fast release cycle, meaning that kernel updates are released every few days to address issues that are found.\nThe rapid release cycle means that vulnerabilities can be fixed faster than in other software. \"Linux is an incredibly active open source project. Thousands of professional developers and volunteers - including many of the most talented in the world - are constantly contributing improvements and fixes to the project. This allows the kernel team to release updates every few days -- one of the fastest release cycles in the industry. Rapid release cycles enable the open source community to fix vulnerabilities and release those fixes to users faster,\" says van Someren.\nHis reason for not being surprised to learn that Linux may have been targeted is down to the fact that it is \"a very widely used operating system, with a huge installed base all around the world.\"\nHe goes on to say:\nFurther, The Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), which has the backing of many leading technology companies, is working to actively assist open source projects globally to help them develop their code using best practices proven to yield more secure results. Decades of software development tell us software will never be bug free. Through the work of open source communities, assistance from programs like CII and engagement with a vast pool of talent and support from contributing companies, we can enable open source software communities to continue producing some of the most secure software on the planet.\nJust as with Apple's response , the Linux Foundation does not make reference to any specific vulnerabilities that have been fixed.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-08T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Bringing peak mindfulness to corporate drones", "content": "Bringing peak mindfulness to corporate drones\nRadu Razvan / Fotolia\nRadu Razvan / Fotolia\nKimberly WeisulInc. Magazine\nStartups are known for missions that are lofty, audacious and sometimes even a bit wacky-sounding. But when it comes to ambition, perhaps no others are a match for Headspace.\n\u201cWe want to improve the health and happiness of the world,\u201d declared Rich Pierson, the company's co-founder.\nThat's a tall order for any company, never mind one that makes a seemingly simple meditation app. But the Los Angeles-based startup claims 12 million active users and says that 80 percent of its growth comes from word of mouth. Headspace, which guides users through hundreds of meditation sessions of various lengths, has a five-star rating in the Apple app store.\nWhile Pierson jokes that we've hit \u201cpeak mindfulness,\u201d he think that there's still lots of opportunity to get more people to meditate. By making the practice both approachable and simple \u2014 not too clinical and not delving into \u201csuper-weird, hippie granola crystal healing madness,\u201d Pierson said \u2014 Headspace aims to make it appealing to those who might not have considered it before.\nThere's also a burgeoning market in large companies that are becoming more aware of the role that mental health could and should play in their corporate wellness programs. That opens up opportunities for companies such as Headspace and meQuilibrium, which offers online stress management.\n\u201cI think companies are growing in the way they view wellness,\u201d said Ron Goetzel, a senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cI think these types of activities \u2014 meditation is one technique \u2014 ought to be part of the tool kit employers use to support workers.\u201d\nMost of the time, that has meant a company would hire a trainer and set up a time for employees to learn meditation or other strategies to build their resilience and deal with stress.\n\u201cSome people like to be in a room with other people,\u201d Goetzel said. \u201cBut it's very hard to get people in a room for an hour.\u201d Delivering meditation via an app allows employees to practice whenever they choose. That may increase adoption.\nIt's not like Headspace is the only meditation app out there. Dozens of entrepreneurs, it seems, see little irony in using the most distracting device we own \u2014 the smartphone \u2014- and trying to turn it into a tool for improved awareness. Headspace, at $7.99 to $12.95 a month (depending on the length of your subscription), also is not the cheapest.\nWhat is does have is an unusual co-founder duo: Andy Puddicombe, a Buddhist monk who does the narration for all of Headspace's sessions, and Pierson, who previously marketed Axe deodorant for BBH, a large agency. Each of them came to meditation through a personal crisis.\nPuddicombe endured a year in which two of his friends were killed by a drunken driver, his stepsister was killed cycling and his ex-girlfriend died during heart surgery. His response, after some initial boozing, was to leave his native England for 10 years, study Buddhism and be ordained as a monk.\nPierson's catalyst was perhaps less dramatic, but it affected him deeply. \u201cI had a bit of a breakdown,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cI couldn't go out on public transport; I couldn't speak in front of people. And my job up until then had been in a very public role.\u201d A friend introduced him to Puddicombe, who was teaching meditation at a clinic while also running intensive one-day meditation events for a few hundred people at a time.\n\u201cWe did a skills swap,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cHe would teach me meditation, and I would help him get more people to his events.\u201d\nEven with Pierson's help, there were still plenty of people who wanted to attend Puddicombe's events but couldn't. They asked if they could buy the handouts that attendees received, so Pierson and Puddicombe started selling that content on their website. In 2011, after an event in New York, they met someone who asked if they had considered selling the content as a subscription.\n\u201cWe were like, no, we definitely hadn't thought of that,\u201d said Pierson, still sounding a bit amused by the oversight. \u201cThe events business is a terrible business model, so we went with the subscription idea.\u201d\nThe following year, they developed some exclusive content for The Guardian. \u201cThat was the turning point,\u201d Pierson said. Subscriptions jumped. Pierson and Puddicombe also built an app, but, Pierson said, \u201cwe didn't have any money. We had different developers working on it all over the world. It was kind of built on quicksand.\u201d\nBy 2013, the founders realized they were building a content company, and moved to Los Angeles. They relaunched the app in July 2014. Meditations are bundled into packs designed to help with relationships, health and other topics.\nIn September 2015, the company raised $34 million, a round led by the Chernin group that included actors Jessica Alba and Jared Leto. Among other things, the money will help Headspace expand internationally and increase the number of animations on its app. Headspace also will be paying more attention to the corporate market this year.\nIts clients include Uber, LinkedIn and Google, Pierson said. These companies get discounts for their employees, and HR managers can tell, in aggregate, how much time employees spend with the app. The 165-person company also offers its content as part of the in-flight entertainment network on seven airlines.\nHeadspace runs about 40 studies on the uses and effects of its app. Some address chronic pain, fatigue and sleep patterns. Another is examining compassion fatigue in nurses.\n\u201cTo me, it's really interesting if Headspace can work with medical professionals,\u201d Pierson said.\nThat would no doubt lend the app some credibility among doubters. While Headspace's user reviews are full of nifty quotes like, \u201cThis changed my life,\u201d Headspace can't promise that subscribers will see any particular gains as a result of the practice.\n\u201cWe are taught that if we do X, we will get Y,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cMeditation is the complete opposite of that. If someone is just starting out, my biggest advice is to expect nothing.\u201d\nIf Pierson thinks it's odd that he and Puddicombe are attempting to build a billion-dollar business based on the practices of a religion that argues strenuously against all forms of materialism, well, he's not letting on. He points out that he and Puddicombe still own a large share of the company, having boot-strapped it for five years. (The company declined to give financial figures.)\nIn the end, Pierson said, \u201cWe're mission-first. We want to make sure we can build the project we envision building. If you've got a big enough vision, you need help and financing to get there.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Saudis take \u00a36bn stake in UK tech giant ARM", "content": "comments\nDeal: SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son is keen to attract international investment\nSaudi investors are taking a 25 per cent stake in British chip designer ARM just six months after it was bought by Japanese firm Softbank.\nIt is understood Softbank, which bought ARM for \u00a324billion in the summer, is placing a \u00a36.6billion stake in the firm into its \u00a382.2billion investment fund.\nBillionaire Softbank boss Masayoshi Son is keen to attract international investment into his so-called Vision Fund, and this deal is seen as key to this.\nSon wants to secure billions of pounds from Abu Dhabi-backed investment group Mubadala, in a bid to raise investment for innovation such as artificial technology and internet-linked household gadgets.\nBut if the deal, as reported in the Financial Times, is true it will give the Saudis increased influence over one of Britain's brightest technology firms.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nShare\nARM designs microchips for vehicles, Apple iPhones, Galaxy smartphones and Amazon Kindle e-readers.\u00a0\nIt is also ploughing greater investment into the driverless car industry and is planning projects in robotics and automotives.\nIt was widely considered to be the jewel in Britain's technology crown, and seen as key to Britain's domination of connected devices.\nWhile its sale to the Japanese was backed by the UK Government, it was widely criticised for letting yet another UK-owned company fall into foreign hands.\u00a0\nThe Government is believed to have been made aware of yesterday's stake sale, although is not thought to have raised concerns.\nIt is thought the transfer of the stake into the Vision Fund was to appease investors, who want ARM to form part of its investments.\nSoftbank is putting about \u00a320billion into the fund, with others expected to invest including Apple, Qualcomm, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn.\nARM and Softbank declined to comment on the reported sale.\nIt is understood Mubadala is in talks with Softbank, and expects to make an announcement next week.\nMubadala, which did not respond to requests to comment from the Daily Mail, told the Financial Times: 'We're having ongoing, fruitful discussions over our participation in the fund.\n'ARM is certainly a strong technology company with great, continued potential. The Abu Dhabi group has been focused on growing its technology investments over the past decade, including in the semiconductor sector.'\nMubadala will invest as much as \u00a312.3billion in the fund and should reach a formal agreement by the end of this month, according to reports. That would make it the second-biggest outside contributor after Saudi Arabia's \u00a337billion.\nThe deal will spark further questions about the loss of ARM to foreign owners, and coming so soon after Softbank's purchase could raise concerns over its commitment to the UK.\nWhen it bought the Cambridge-based firm, Softbank pledged to embark on a major recruitment drive while keeping its headquarters in the UK.\u00a0\nBut questions have been asked over the legality of that commitment \u2013 the promises are untested and there is no precedent for enforcing them.\nNews of the Softbank takeover came just after Britain voted to leave the EU, and Downing Street called it a vote of confidence in Britain.\u00a0\nBut at the time, ARM founder Hermann Hauser said he was 'disappointed' the company would no longer be British-owned.\u00a0\n'I still regret the fact we have lost our last independent high-tech company with a global reach,' he said. 'There was no reason for change. It had \u00a31billion of cash and had got it right for the last 30 years.'\nIt will also throw Son's investments into scrutiny.\nIn December Son pledged a $50billion (\u00a341.1billion) investment in the US, which he said would create 50,000 jobs \u2013 a move US president Donald Trump said was a direct result of his election win.\nEDITOR'S DEALS OF THE WEEK\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-08T21:50:58Z", "images": []}
{"title": "CIA hacking dossier leak reignites debate over vulnerability disclosure", "content": "CIA hacking dossier leak reignites debate over vulnerability disclosure\nSpy agencies more interested in stockpiling bugs than closing the gaps\nBy John Leyden 8\u00a0Mar\u00a02017\u00a0at\u00a019:21\nSHARE \u25bc\nWikiLeaks' dump of CIA hacking tool documents on Tuesday has kicked off a debate among security vendors about whether intel agencies are stockpiling vulnerabilities, and the effect this is having on overall security hygiene.\nThe leaked documents purport to show how the intel agency infiltrates smartphones, PCs, routers, IoT gear, potentially smart TVs, and other gear, using a range of hacking tools, as previously reported . These capabilities are hardly surprising to anyone who remembers the disclosures from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden back in 2013.\nThe CIA's abilities are more aligned toward targeted attacks rather than mass surveillance and bulk data collection \u2013 the stock in trade of the NSA, GCHQ and other signals intelligence agencies.\nStill, it means the spy agency has a stockpile of vulnerabilities in hardware and software for a future exploitation, and it is unlikely to share details of these bugs with vendors in case the programming flaws are patched, according to security watchers.\nMikko Hypponen, chief research officer of security software firm F-Secure, commented: \"In countries like the US, the intelligence agencies' mission is to keep the citizens of their country safe. The Vault7 leak proves that the CIA had knowledge of iPhone vulnerabilities.\"\n\"However, instead of informing Apple, the CIA decided to keep it secret. So the leak tells us a bit about how the CIA decided to use its knowledge: it considered it more important to keep everybody insecure than protecting its citizens from the vulnerability, and maybe use the vulnerability for its own purposes or counter terrorism purposes.\"\nSlawek Ligier, VP of security engineering at Barracuda,\u00a0argued CIA hacking could be working against its wider national interest.\n\"If the CIA knows of the specific exploit, chances are that the MI6, FSB, MSS, and Mossad are aware of it as well,\" Ligier said. \"Not working on closing the gap and hoping that we will be the only ones able to exploit it puts all of us at risk. And frankly, the United States has much more to lose through potential industrial espionage than other countries.\"\nNot all experts agree that the CIA is stockpiling vulns. \"The government doesn't 'hoard' zero days. It uses zero days, it doesn't have a cache of zero days it isn't using,\" according to Rob Graham of Errata Security. Graham added that the agency buys rather than finds unpatched vulnerabilities, so critics are actually arguing that the government should spend millions on vulnerabilities in order to disclose them to vendors.\nThe CIA is yet to either confirm or deny the authenticity of the leak, but former spy agency boss Michael Hayden has decried the release \u2013 if confirmed \u2013 as \"damaging\" to the techniques and tactics used by the the CIA to conduct legitimate foreign intelligence, thereby making Western countries less safe. What's been exposed is at least consistent with what we know about the CIA's likely capabilities and experts are taking it seriously.\n\"The CIA reports show the USG developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open,\" said Edward Snowden in a Twitter update . \"Reckless beyond words.\"\nSecurity pundits fear that information exposed in the release will allow cybercriminals and less capable nation states to up the ante.\nRichard Henderson, global security strategist at computer forensics outfit Absolute, said: \"What's especially scary about the dump, and the exploits behind them, is that it appears the CIA may have lost control of all the tools at their disposal ... meaning that it is entirely likely that all of these exploits, vulnerabilities, tools, and malware are now in the hands of foreign governments or cybercriminals. In fact, the CIA's own documents show that they have been sharing selected exploits to other 'friendly' foreign governments for their own purposes.\n\"These developments are troubling for many reasons. First, the fact that a government intelligence agency has been actively purchasing, developing, and distributing critical vulnerabilities in ubiquitous consumer devices forces us to ask some very hard questions about the levels of oversight these agencies have right now. Second, this incident makes it crystal clear to me that the government push to mandate or legislate backdoors into devices (which Apple pushed back on recently) can never be successful. These backdoors will leak out into the open, making it entirely likely that agencies not friendly to the West will also take advantage of these vulnerabilities,\" Henderson warned.\nCraig Fagan, policy director at the Web Foundation, said: \"Governments should be safeguarding the digital privacy and security of their citizens, but these alleged actions by the CIA do just the opposite. Weaponizing everyday products such as TVs and smartphones \u2013 and failing to disclose vulnerabilities to manufacturers \u2013 is dangerous and short-sighted. It puts people around the world at risk of attack from hackers and repressive regimes, and this leak itself shows just how likely such tools are to spread beyond the organization that developed them.\"\nSome vendors hoped the release would help spur the development of patches from Apple, Google and other affected vendors.\nFrom Casey Ellis, chief exec and founder of bug bounty outfit Bugcrowd: \"In this mix there are the targeted vendors who, before today, were likely unaware of the specific vulnerabilities these exploits were targeting. Right now, the security teams are pulling apart the Wikileaks dump, performing technical analysis, assessing and prioritizing the risk to their products and the people who use them, and instructing the engineering teams towards creating patches.\n\"The net outcome over the long term is actually a good thing for Internet security \u2013 the vulnerabilities that were exploited by these tools will be patched, and the risk to consumers reduced as a result \u2013 but for now we are entering yet another Shadow Brokers, Stuxnet, Flame, Duqu, etc, a period of actively exploitable 0-days bouncing around in the wild,\" Ellis concluded.\nAbsolute's Henderson added: \"I hope that if the technical details of the exploits become more and more in the open, device manufacturers will be quick to respond with updates and remediation steps to protect customers.\"\nWikileaks, the CIA, and the original exploit authors have combined to provide the same knowledge as the \"good old days\" of full disclosure \u2013 but with far less control and a great many more side-effects than if the vendors were to take the initiative themselves, according to\u00a0Bugcrowd's Ellis.\n\"It's only when the pain of doing nothing exceeds the pain of change that the majority of organizations will shift to a proactive vulnerability discovery strategy and the vulnerabilities exploited by these toolkits \u2013 and the risk those vulnerabilities create for the Internet \u2013 will become less and less common,\" Ellis concluded. \u00ae\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-08T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "The creator of 'Oregon Trail' once had to spend a long weekend retyping the game by hand", "content": "The creator of 'Oregon Trail' once had to spend a long weekend retyping the game by hand\nMatt Weinberger\nMatt Weinberger/Business Insider\nThe three creators of \u2018Oregon Trail\u2019 circa 1996. In the middle is Bill Heinemann, holding one of the \u2018sacred scrolls\u2019 that contains the original \u2018Oregon Trail source code.\nIf you were an \u201980s or \u201990s kid, you probably have fond memories of school days playing \u201c The Oregon Trail ,\u201d the pioneering (har har) educational video game about America\u2019s westward migration.\nAt a talk at this week\u2019s Game Developer Conference, \u201cOregon Trail\u201d co-creator Don Rawitsch took the stage to discuss the history of the game, the sheer impact it\u2019s had on entire generations of kids, and how it almost didn\u2019t happen at all.\nCirca late 1971, Rawitsch was a student teacher in Minneapolis, and given two weeks by the school administration to prepare a unit on the Manifest Destiny era of American history. Figuring a game would engage the students better than any textbook, he set to work designing a board game with dice and spinners.\nHis roommates Bill Heinemann and Paul Dillenberger, more mathematically minded, noted that this school was one of the very few at that point to have a room-sized mainframe machine available for student usage, and suggested that maybe \u201cit would be a lot better on a computer.\u201d\nYouTube\n\u2018The Oregon Trail.\u2019 This is a later version. You can tell because it\u2019s in colour.\nThe three men worked around the clock for two weeks, delivering version 1.0 of \u201cOregon Trail\u201d just in time for the unit to start. And it was an immediate smash hit, he says, with the kids \u201cmesmerised\u201d and other teachers inventing \u201cflimsy excuses\u201d why their students should get to play it, too.\nAt the end of the semester, Rawitsch\u2019s student teaching gig came to a close, and so he deleted \u201cOregon Trail\u201d from the school\u2019s computers before he went \u2014 but not before the three men printed copies of the game\u2019s source code, in a series of long printouts that he calls \u201cthe sacred scrolls of \u2018The Oregon Trail.'\u201d\nLegend of the scrolls\nFast forward to 1974, and Rawitsch ended up working for the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC), a company providing software and computer services to schools. He figured it was the perfect opportunity to revive \u201cOregon Trail\u201d and bring it to a broader audience.\nBut remember, at this point, \u201cOregon Trail\u201d literally only existed as those \u201csacred scrolls.\u201d And so, Rawitsch says, \u201con one long weekend, I typed in 800 lines of code from my kitchen at home to put \u2018The Oregon Trail\u2019 back up on a computer.\u201d\nRawitsch/Reddit\n\u2018The Oregon Trail\u2019 co-creator Don Rawitsch circa 2016.\nThe rest is history: It became the most popular piece of educational software in Minnesota, and soon, the country, as Rawitsch worked to make the game more historically accurate, even while the MECC team helped update it for the fast-evolving PC market. The original mainframe version gave way to versions for the Apple II and more.\nAt one point, Rawitsch says, \u201cThe Oregon Trail\u201d accounted for one-third of MECC\u2019s revenue, standing out among the hundreds of pieces of software that the company published. It would sustain its popularity all the way through the mid-nineties, with millions of kids growing up with it in the classroom.\nAs a footnote, Rawitsch says that Bill Heinemann still has his \u201csacred scroll.\u201d And when his son (of unknown age) asked if, perhaps, he was old enough to take stewardship of the scroll, Heinemann had a simple answer: \u201cNo.\u201d\nHistorical footnotes\nIt\u2019s too much to go into the full depth of Rawitsch\u2019s talk, but here are a few extra highlights:\nThe original version of \u201cThe Oregon Trail\u201d was accessed through a Teletype machine, which is kind of a computer without a screen. The only sound effect they had access to was a bicycle bell, and hunting was accomplished by typing BANG or POW or KABAM as fast as you could with no typos.\nHe once met with the creator of \u201c Organ Trail ,\u201d a very popular zombie-themed parody of \u201cOregon Trail.\u201d \u201cI met the young man that made this game. They\u2019re sane,\u201d he says with a smile.\nDysentery, the dread disease that so terrified \u201cOregon Trail\u201d players that it became a meme decades later, wasn\u2019t added to the game by the original developers. That was a contribution by the Apple II team.\nHe says that he\u2019s impressed by \u201cMinecraft,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s international brick-building phenomenon. It came out of nowhere to become something that\u2019s increasingly popular in classrooms, Rawitsch says. \u201cThat was surprising to me.\u201d\nAnd finally, the life lessons that Rawitsch says he\u2019s learned from \u201cThe Oregon Trail:\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-05T16:30:00Z", "images": []}

According to a report from Recode , Didi Chuxing is today opening a new artificial intelligence lab right in Apple\u2019s backyard\u2026\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\nThe report states that Didi is opening the new self-driving operation in Mountain View, California, putting it in the heart of the ever-growing self-driving industry. Within a small radius of Didi\u2019s new lab, you have Apple, Google, and Tesla, all of which are believed to have a vested\u00a0interest in self-driving technology.\nThe Chinese company\u2019s new U.S. lab, which will focus on intelligent driving systems and AI-based security for transportation, also formalizes what many already knew: Didi is working on self-driving cars.\nIt\u2019s a smart, almost necessary move for Didi to move its AI operations to what is quickly becoming the mecca of the self-driving industry, mostly because that\u2019s where the talent is.\nThe expansion to Mountain View also marks the first time that Didi Chuxing has expanded its physical footprint outside of China. The company has, however, expanded into areas like Southeast Asia, India, and Brazil via investments in local ride-hail companies.\nAdditionally, Didi has also hired Charlie Miller to lead its security and safety development teams. Miller first made a name for himself when he hacked and remotely stopped a Jeep and has more recently been in charge of\u00a0security at\u00a0Uber\u2019s self-driving department for the last year and a half.\u00a0\u00a0Miller will report to Dr. Fengim Gong, the co-founder of Palo Alto Networks and Didi\u2019s vice president of information security.\nIn addition to Miller, Didi has also poached from Google\u2019s self-driving company, Waymo. Jia Zhaoyin, who was originally a senior software engineer at Waymo, is now a principal engineer at Didi.\nAt the time, Tim Cook\u00a0explained\u00a0that Apple\u2019s investment in Didi was for a \u201cnumber of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market.\u201d Though, many have speculated that the investment is for various other reasons, such as Apple\u2019s oft-rumored interest in the car industry .\n\u201cWe are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market,\u201d Cook said. \u201cOf course, we believe it will deliver a strong return for our invested capital over time as well.\u201d\nGuides\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-08T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Triplebyte expands its recruiting platform beyond YC and signs up Apple and Facebook", "content": "Frederic Lardinois @fredericl / 2 years\nTriplebyte \u00a0wants to make recruiting and technical screening for tech companies more efficient. The screening process happens background-blind, so instead of\u00a0putting the emphasis on the applicants\u2019 resumes (and the colleges they went to), it emphasizes programming smarts. Triplebyte\u00a0previously only worked with Y Combinator-incubated companies, though. Now, however, it has expanded its program and is working with Facebook, Apple and other large companies.\nAs Harj Taggar, the company\u2019s CEO and co-founder (and former YC partner), tells me, the idea to start with YC companies was born out of the realization that the YC ecosystem was now big enough to provide the scale necessary for a service like this. As the company grew, though, the team realized that engineers wanted a broad choice of companies to work with (it only shows engineers companies that look like they would be a good match for their technical abilities).\nBesides Apple and Facebook, Triplebyte is now working with Asana, Palantir and others. The company\u2019s promise to engineers is that they will be able to bypass the usual phone screening process and move right to onsite interviews if a company wants to work with them. For companies, Triplebyte promises that it has thoroughly screened the applicants through its online coding test and that they are a good fit for them.\nOne interesting aspect of Triplebyte\u2019s process is that when the company sends its\u00a0candidates\u2019 profile to a potential employer, it strips out the name, schools they attended and the companies where they\u2019ve worked. \u201cWe do this to reduce bias in the screening process \u2014 recruiters are so used to screening based on keywords in resumes that this approach is what\u2019s needed to increase the diversity of backgrounds in tech,\u201d Taggar\u00a0told me.\nTaggar says that the companies that use Triplebyte\u2019s service typically make an offer to half the engineers\u00a0his company sends them. That\u2019s a 2x\u00a0improvement over the industry standard, which is closer to\u00a01 in 4.\nGiven that this process upsets the traditional recruiting process, the company has faced some resistance\u00a0from companies, Taggar admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s scary for companies to commit to bringing candidates straight to an onsite without doing technical screening because each onsite is 4-5 hours of engineering time spent,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe YC ecosystem was just more willing to trust us at first, which let us build up a data set to prove this process works and get to a scale where Facebook/Apple, etc. were willing to take a shot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-09T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Uber gets San Francisco autonomous car permit but loses AI execs", "content": "Uber gets San Francisco autonomous car permit but loses AI execs\nChris Davies - Mar 9, 2017, 1:45 pm CST\n1\nUber, pressured into applying for a self-driving car testing license by San Francisco, has been granted approval for a small-scale roll out by city regulators. The ride-sharing company had flouted local rules on autonomous vehicles, sending out a fleet of customized Volvo SUVs back in December 2016 for real-world testing of its work-in-progress technology. However, the Department of Motor Vehicles disagreed with Uber\u2019s justification for why it didn\u2019t require a license.\nUber\u2019s argument was that there is a difference between what the DMV considered a \u201cself-driving\u201d vehicle and its own cars. Since the Uber prototypes would require a human driver to monitor performance, Anthony Levandowski, Head of the Advanced Technology Group at Uber, suggested, they couldn\u2019t be considered fully autonomous. Unsurprisingly, the DMV disagreed .\n\u201cTwenty manufacturers have already obtained permits to test hundreds of cars on California roads,\u201d a DMV spokesperson pointed out. \u201cUber shall do the same.\u201d\nUnswayed, Uber continued to flout the DMV\u2019s rules, and its autonomous fleet went on to pick up riders booking travel through the company\u2019s app . Things were brought to a crashing halt, however, when the DMV revoked the registrations of the Uber fleet. Those registrations had been improperly issued, it argued, because the cars hasn\u2019t been marked as test vehicles.\nWith little room to maneuver \u2013 autonomously or otherwise \u2013 Uber opted to pull its entire prototype garage from San Francisco. In late December, it announced it would take the cars to Arizona instead , claiming lawmakers there had been more receptive to the trials. Nonetheless, it turned out that Uber wasn\u2019t quite ready to give up on California.\nEarlier this month, indeed, the company applied for an official self-driving car permit , and it\u2019s that which has been granted this week. Only two of the XC90-based prototypes will be allowed on the road at any one time, though, according to the SF Examiner , and only 48 people are on the list as legally allowed to operate them. Unlike in other areas where Uber is running the cars, they won\u2019t be taking paying customers either.\nUber confirmed to the Examiner that it did not intend to resume its San Francisco pilot. The DMV had made clear that its licensing covers only a test driver, and has no sway on whether passengers are allowed inside or not.\nThere seems to be plenty of work for the company to do, mind. Having originally blamed a human operator for an Uber autonomous car running a red light on the first day of the San Francisco deployment, subsequent investigations by the New York Times indicated the car was, in fact, driving itself at that moment. Bike safety activists were against the trials from the outset, claiming that Uber knew its vehicles would be unable to deal with cyclists correctly yet pushed ahead with in-the-wild testing regardless.\nIt\u2019ll be doing so with a changed team, too. Chinese firm Didi Chuxing, which operates the country\u2019s biggest ride-hailing system and which saw Apple investment last year , has not only opened up an artificial intelligence lab in Silicon Valley, but poached an Uber engineer to work there. Charlie Miller, known for his work on the Jeep hack that forced Fiat Chrysler to recall 1.4m vehicles, had been at Uber until last week. Now, Recode reports, he\u2019ll be Didi\u2019s new head of safety and security.\nThat\u2019s not the only high-profile departure. Gary Marcus, who had joined Uber as part of the company\u2019s acquisition of his AI startup, Geometric Intelligence, is leaving after just four months, Axios reported. He will remain a \u201csenior advisor\u201d to the firm, Marcus confirmed, though relocate to New York.\nOvershadowing all of Uber\u2019s work are allegations from Alphabet-owned Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out from Google\u2019s research labs, that Uber execs stole autonomous technology . Uber has denied the allegations, that management at Otto \u2013 a company founded by former Waymo engineers as a self-driving AI incubator \u2013 took proprietary data on things like Google\u2019s exclusive LIDAR sensor designs as they left to set up their new venture. Waymo also accused the former-execs of trying to poach other employees.\nStory Timeline\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-09T19:45:45Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ size comparison", "content": "Samsung Galaxy S7 edge\nTo see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.\nThe Galaxy S8 (148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm), which has a display with a usable area of 5.7 inches (5.8\u2033 without accounting for the rounded corners), is a bit taller than the 5.1-inch S7 (148.9 mm vs 142.4 mm), but it's almost the same width (68 mm vs 69.6 mm), all the while upping screen size to 5.7 inches. The curvature of the S8 no doubt helps fit more on it, but it's not the real reason for the difference in display real estate. That would be the aspect ratio of the new Infinity Display.\nIt's a similar scenario between the Galaxy S8+ (159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm) and S7 edge \u2013 the new phone is taller than its predecessor (159.5 mm vs 150.9 mm), and just a tad wider (73.4 mm vs 72.6 mm), but the new phone ups the size of its display from 5.5 inches to 6.1 inches.\nHowever, you should keep in mind that a 5.7-inch display with the new aspect ratio is something quite different from a 9:16 display with the same diagonal. For example, the display of the S8 is considerably taller than that of the S7, but it is almost identical in width. This means that, despite the new screen being technically larger, you are getting only a vertical bump in size, so to speak, while nothing changes in terms of width. Here is a diagram illustrating how the display of the Galaxy S8 (blue) compares directly to that of the Galaxy S7 (yellow):\nSamsung Galaxy S7 display pictured within Galaxy S8's Infinity Display (not accounting for rounded corners)\nAgain, S8's display is curved, which too helps fit more in less, but its bend is a lot more subtle than that of the S7 edge, and more akin to what we saw on the Note 7. As you can clearly see, the 5.7-inch 9:18.5 display on the S8, although having a larger area than S7's 5.1-inch 9:16 display, is simply taller, and that's exactly the point. After all, the idea here is to have a phone that's very similar in size to what we're used to, all the while still offering a larger display area.\nIf you're still unsure as to whether changing the aspect ratio is a step in the right direction, just wait until you see how the Galaxy S8 and S8+ look next to some other current flagship devices.\u00a0\nThat said, let's now move on to a battle between the S8s and two of last year's top offerings \u2013 the iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel XL.\nApple iPhone 7 Plus\nTo see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.\nIt is redundant at this point to discuss the top and bottom bezels on the iPhones and the Pixels \u2013 everything has been said already. The iPhone 7 Plus is 9.2 mm taller than the S8, and it has a 5.5-inch screen. The Pixel XL too has a 5.5-inch display and similar dimensions to the iPhone 7 Plus, so it doesn't fare any better (or worse) than it against the sleek new Samsungs.\nHere's where it gets interesting though. It's time to pit the brand new LG G6, which has a slightly shorter 9:18 (or 1:2) display, against the S8 brothers:\nSamsung Galaxy S8+\nTo see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.\nThe G6 is one sleek smartphone that packs a 5.7-inch display in a body that's the same size as that of the 5.3-inch LG G5. Again, that's thanks to its FullVision 1:2 display.\nWhen placed next to the Galaxy S8, the G6 is the same height (148.9 mm), but a tad wider (at 71.9 mm vs 68.1 mm), due to its screen being flat and its side bezels being a bit bigger as a result. Still, the G6 is in and of itself a glimpse into the future of smartphones \u2013 a future where devices are mostly screen on the front and almost no bezels, all the while remaining close to the dimensions of their predecessors.\nIn the coming year, we'll see more and more phone makers adopt similar screen aspect ratios to those of the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+. While no other manufacturers have made any concrete announcements yet, numerous rumors suggest that Apple may be next in line to adopt a similar approach to designing one of the upcoming iPhone models, and if that happens, it would only be a matter of time before the entire industry gets on board with the idea.\nAnd, as a bonus, here's a bunch more size comparisons between the Galaxy S8/S8+ and other current smartphones:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-09T10:55:00Z", "images": []}

A rootkit is a malicious program that runs with high privileges -- typically in the kernel -- and hides the existence of other malicious components and activities.\nThe documents from CIA's Embedded Development Branch (EDB) mention an OS X \"implant\" called DerStarke that includes a kernel code injection module dubbed Bokor and an EFI persistence module called DarkMatter.\n[ For more on IoT security, see our corporate guide to addressing IoT security concerns . | Get regularly scheduled insights by signing up for Network World newsletters . ]\nEFI, also known as UEFI (Unified EFI), is the low-level firmware that runs before the operating system and initializes the various hardware components during the system boot process. It's the replacement for the older and much more basic BIOS in modern computers and resembles a mini operating system. It can have hundreds of \"programs\" for different functions implemented as executable binaries.\nA malicious program hidden inside the EFI can inject malicious code into the OS kernel and can restore any malware that has been removed from the computer. This allows rootkits to survive major system updates and even reinstallations.\nIn addition to DarkMatter, there is a second project in the CIA EDB documents called QuarkMatter that is also described as a \"Mac OS X EFI implant which uses an EFI driver stored on the EFI system partition to provide persistence to an arbitrary kernel implant.\"\nThe Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security has created a new module for its existing CHIPSEC open-source framework to detect rogue EFI binaries. CHIPSEC consists of a set of command-line tools that use low-level interfaces to analyze a system's hardware, firmware, and platform components. It can be run from Windows, Linux, macOS, and even from an EFI shell.\n[ Prepare to become a Certified Information Security Systems Professional with this comprehensive online course from PluralSight. Now offering a 10-day free trial! ]\nThe new CHIPSEC module allows the user to take a clean EFI image from the computer manufacturer, extract its contents and build a whitelist of the binary files inside. It can then compare that list against the system's current EFI or against an EFI image previously extracted from a system.\nIf the tool finds any binary files that don't match the clean EFI list, it's possible that the firmware has been infected. The rogue files are listed and can then be further analyzed.\n\"We recommend generating an EFI 'whitelist' after purchasing a system or when sure it hasn\u2019t been infected,\" the Intel Security researchers said in a blog post . \"Then check EFI firmware on your system periodically or whenever concerned, such as when a laptop was left unattended.\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-09T18:32:00Z", "images": []}

So...big surprise: Am having multiple 'password reset' attempts right now,\" Sasse tweeted Saturday . The probing was hitting \"basically every device, every platform, personal and govt,\" he added in a follow-up tweet .\nSasse did not elaborate on the exact nature of the password-reset messages he said he'd seen, such as whether they were limited to a single app -- Twitter, for instance -- and how they had been sent.\nSasse was not the only federal lawmaker to make the claim about reset requests. \"Getting a lot of 'password reset' requests. Must be angering the hacker/WikiLeaks crowd by calling out Trump/Russia ties,\" tweeted Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) Sunday .\nMost attacks featuring password-reset requests rely on email. The messages purport to be from a service's support team. The links embedded in such notifications direct users to bogus sites, which harvest the credentials as they're entered.

It makes so much sense that the timing of our party really gave Tumblr an opportunity to step in,\u201d McCullough said.\nTumblr\u2019s relationship with Planned Parenthood is close; not only does the nonprofit organization use the social platform to communicate with followers and supporters, but Karp is also on the Planned Parenthood board of directors.\nAbove: David Karp, center, discusses Tumblr\u2019s challenges at the Web Summit in Dublin.

It was about how to reach young people and learn and listen to them on Tumblr as Planned Parenthood was building out its own apps and community,\u201d Laguens explained.\nTumblr\u2019s support as a corporate citizen, Laguens\u00a0believes, could spur similar action from other companies. \u201cI think they are going to unleash a flood of other organizations and corporations that say that this is what the new moment demands of us,\u201d she said.\nBut regardless of whether companies stand up and be counted, Laguens was staunch in her belief that Planned Parenthood will still be around in the long term. \u201cWe plan to be here as long as people need us,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what hurdles go up, we\u2019re finding new, better, and personalized ways to deliver health care information.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-11T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Pandora launches premium music service", "content": "Pandora launches premium music service\nBy Benny Evangelista\nUpdated\n6:38\u00a0pm CDT, Monday, March 13, 2017\nPandora has finally announced a new on-demand music service called Pandora Premium. The new on-demand service, which costs $9.99 monthly, offers a combination of radio-like listening as well as the option to search and play any track and create your own playlists. Currently, Pandora's Internet radio can be listened to free with advertisements, but you cannot choose a specific song, only artists or a type of music. Pandora Premium is rolling out starting this week via invitation.\nMedia: Wibbitz\nOnline music pioneer Pandora Media will launch its long-awaited, on-demand premium service this week, providing a late but potentially formidable competitor to Spotify, Apple, Google and Amazon.\nThe Oakland company said Monday on its company blog that it will roll out Pandora Premium Wednesday to select members as a free trial. The $10 per month service will become an optional upgrade for its existing base of 81 million active listeners over the coming weeks.\nSince its founding in 2000, Pandora has relied on serving up music playlists like a radio station, except that listeners could only choose types of songs or artists and not play specific songs. The company was built on a vast database cataloging the attributes of recorded songs and audio called the Music Genome Project, and it created a complex system of algorithms to personalize those playlists.\nThe new service is also built upon technology Pandora acquired when it bought the assets of bankrupt streaming music service Rdio in 2015 for $75 million. Some listeners still miss the old Rdio.\nTim Westergren, Pandora founder, sits for a portrait in a recent expansion of the Pandora office on Monday, October 20, 2015 in Oakland, Calif.\nTim Westergren, Pandora founder, sits for a portrait in a recent expansion of the Pandora office on Monday, October 20, 2015 in Oakland, Calif.\nPhoto: Lea Suzuki / The Chronicle\nPhoto: Lea Suzuki / The Chronicle\nImage 1 of / 1\nClose\nImage 1 of 1\nTim Westergren, Pandora founder, sits for a portrait in a recent expansion of the Pandora office on Monday, October 20, 2015 in Oakland, Calif.\nTim Westergren, Pandora founder, sits for a portrait in a recent expansion of the Pandora office on Monday, October 20, 2015 in Oakland, Calif.\nPhoto: Lea Suzuki / The Chronicle\nPandora launches premium music service\n1 \u00a0/\u00a0 1\nBack to Gallery\n\u201cPlease please PLEASE let pandora premium be the old @Rdio with a new name!\u201d Paul Gilzow tweeted after Pandora announced the service.\nAlthough Pandora is relatively late to the on-demand music service game, CEO and founder Tim Westergren believes its big existing user base gives it a leg up on the competition.\n\u201cWith premium, we\u2019re leveraging our immense trove of data and everything we\u2019ve learned about personalization to offer a listening experience that sets a new standard for what a music service should be,\u201d Westergren said in a press release.\nDan Cryan, senior director of broadband media for the research firm IHS Markit, said Pandora is jumping into a \u201ctwo-horse race\u201d for on-demand music services, with \u201cSpotify as the global market leader followed by Apple Music.\u201d\nHowever, Pandora\u2019s existing base of Internet radio listeners gives it a solid launch pad, he said.\n\u201cWhile Pandora is late, it is by no means too late, if they can execute properly,\u201d Cryan said. \u201cIt would be a mistake to believe it will be a two-horse race forever.\u201d\nPandora has been under financial pressure because of the competition from Spotify and Apple Music. In January, Pandora announced it was cutting 7 percent of its workforce. The company has been the subject of persistent takeover rumors since last year, when activist hedge fund Corvex Management began pressuring Pandora\u2019s board to explore a sale.\nPandora generates most of its revenue from advertising. Only about 4.4 million people, or 12 percent of all Pandora users, subscribe to a $5 per month ad-free plan called Pandora Plus.\nPlus subscribers will receive six months of premium for no extra charge. With premium, listeners can start a playlist with one or two songs, then ask the Music Genome Project to fill out the rest, the company said.\nIt will also include playlists created by every song Pandora listeners have ever marked as \u201cthumbs up,\u201d or favorites.\nBenny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

There is in fact no evidence that this is the case.\nNordVPN\nAny suggestion that Signal had been compromised would be particularly worrying as it is a favorite tool of journalists when communicating with sources whose safety could be endangered if it was known they were talking to the press.\nThe misunderstanding arises because the CIA\u2019s tools would allow it to take control of\u00a0specific devices, and once a device is compromised, then\u00a0end-to-end encryption no longer offers any protection. But that\u2019s very different from suggesting that the apps themselves have been compromised.\nIndeed, as Edward Snowden and others have observed, the very fact that the CIA needs to attack devices is evidence that it has been unable to intercept\u00a0communications\u00a0which employ strong encryption. As the\u00a0 NYT puts it:\nIf anything in the WikiLeaks revelations is a bombshell, it is just how strong these encrypted apps appear to be. Since it doesn\u2019t have a means of easy mass surveillance of such apps, the C.I.A. seems to have had to turn its attention to the harder and often high-risk task of breaking into individual devices one by one.\nSo sure, if your device has been compromised, all bets are off. But there is nothing at all to suggest that the CIA has any ability to decode communications from\u00a0IM apps\u00a0which use strong encryption. The\u00a0NYT again:\nNeither Signal nor WhatsApp, for example, appears by name in any of the alleged C.I.A. files in the cache. (Using automated tools to search the whole database, as security researchers subsequently did, turned up no hits.) More important, the hacking methods described in the documents do not, in fact, include the ability to bypass such encrypted apps.\nBoth Apple and Google have stated that \u2018many\u2019 of the exploits revealed have already been patched , and that they are working swiftly to fix others \u2013 a task made easier by the announcement that Wikileaks will share with tech companies the full details of the hacks.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Pandora Premium opens the service\u2019s catalog of music up to on-demand access for a monthly fee.\nLike Apple Music, Pandora Premium will cost $9.99/month for on-demand music access, offline playback, and personalized stations and playlists. At first glance, the new subscription\u00a0doesn\u2019t appear to have anything super compelling that would make an Apple Music or Spotify subscriber jump services.\nHere\u2019s how Pandora details the new service features:\nPlaylists, not worklists: Start a playlist with one or two songs of your choice, tap \u201cAdd Similar Songs\u201d and put the power of Pandora\u2019s Music Genome Project to work to create the perfect playlist for any activity, mood or party.\nAll your thumbs up: Every song you\u2019ve thumbed up on Pandora is immediately available in your \u201cMy Thumbs Up\u201d playlist.

The tech companies argue that this would set a \u2018troubling\u2019 precedent.\nBusiness Insider reports that the\u00a0 FBI \u00a0served search warrants ordering Google to hand over emails belonging to\u00a0suspects in a criminal investigation. The emails in question were stored on a server stored outside the USA, and Google refused, arguing\u00a0that a domestic search warrant\u00a0could not apply\u00a0to data stored in a foreign country \u2026\nNordVPN\nA\u00a0Pennsylvania court disagreed, instructing Google to comply with the warrant. Google appealed the ruling, and Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have now filed a joint amicus brief in support of the search giant. (An amicus brief is a submission by parties not directly involved in a case but which to express a view for the court to consider.)\nThe filing does not suggest that the government is necessarily wrong to seek to extend the law to data stored overseas, but rather argues that the current law does not permit this, and it is for Congress \u2013 and not the courts \u2013 to make this call.\nThis case addresses the reach of the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\u00a0et\u00a0seq., which Congress enacted as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986.\u00a0Technology has changed dramatically since the SCA became law. The Congress that drafted the\u00a0SCA could barely have imagined the notion of storing emails halfway across the globe. That is\u00a0why companies, commentators, and privacy advocates alike have long called for the SCA to be\u00a0updated in light of the realities of 21st century technology.\u00a0The question here, however, is the scope of the SCA as it now stands, not as Congress\u00a0might eventually revise it.\nThe tech companies do, however,\u00a0argue that Congress should consider carefully the implications of applying U.S. search warrants to data held in other countries.\nEqually troubling, it invites foreign nations to reciprocate by likewise\u00a0demanding that local offices of U.S. technology companies turn over U.S. citizens\u2019 private\u00a0communications stored on U.S. soil. It also places technology companies that store customer\u00a0data abroad in the untenable position of being compelled to risk violating foreign data privacy\u00a0laws to comply with warrants issued by U.S. courts.\nIn other words,\u00a0it would be a dangerous precedent to signal that any country can behave in the way the U.S. is attempting to behave here.\nApple of course resisted the FBI itself in the San Bernardino shooting case, refusing to create a weakened version of iOS that would allow access to an iPhone \u2013 and Google filed an amicus brief supporting Apple in that case.\nGuides\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-14T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "More iPad screen sizes unlikely to stop slump", "content": "Computerworld\nMore iPad screen sizes unlikely to stop slump\nAnalysts ponder rumors of additional tablet choices\nGregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 15 March, 2017 01:44\n-\nComments\nApple would be smart to make good on speculation about new iPad screen sizes, a pair of analysts said today.\n\"The tablet has evolved from a general-purpose device to more of a specialized device,\" argued Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, when asked about long-circulating rumors of a coming expansion to the iPad line. \"Certain sizes are better optimized for more specialized applications.\"\nTalk of additional iPads -- notably one with a 10.5-in. screen -- has circulated for months, kick started by Ming-Chi Kuo, a financial analyst with KGI Securities. More recently, however, rumors focused on a spring launch, perhaps this month, perhaps in May or June.\nApple last changed the portfolio's pricing in September 2016, but except for the 9.7-in. iPad Pro introduced a year ago, the hardware has remained static since the fall of 2015.\nAnd during that stretch iPad unit sales continued to contract -- the slump has now lasted three years -- and tablet revenue continued to shrink in raw numbers and percentage of Apple's total. Apple sold 13.1 million iPads in the December 2016 quarter, down 19% from the same period the year prior. Meanwhile, iPad revenue of $5.5 billion was 22% lower than in the December quarter of 2015.\nCEO Tim Cook has not changed how he has described the iPad to Wall Street -- in January, Cook again said he was \"very bullish\" on the tablet -- nor laid out a strategy to return the line to growth.\nO'Donnell saw portfolio expansion as a simultaneous recognition of market reality and a way to increase sales. \"To support more of these specialized usages means a wider variety of screen sizes,\" O'Donnell said. \"That, for me, would be logical. And it would let Apple expand the number of price points as well.\"\nThe original iPad Pro -- the 12.9-in. device unveiled in September 2015 -- was a good example of specialization, O'Donnell contended. \"It did well by bringing up the ASP [average selling price], but it's not a mainstream product,\" he said.\nEzra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, echoed O'Donnell on the usefulness of more screen sizes. \"It makes sense to give customers a wider range of choices,\" he said.\nExpanded options would be in keeping with the tablet market's maturation, Gottheil added. \"That's part of the landscape for products we buy for practical and entertainment purposes both,\" he said.\nEven so, it's unlikely that Apple can reverse the iPad's course simply by multiplying screen sizes. \"There's nothing in the universe that will make a zillion people buy [a tablet],\" Gottheil said.\nLong replacement cycles -- getting longer by the year -- and for many original purchasers, no intention of ever buying another tablet, doom tablets to, at best, growth rates miniscule in comparison to those of five or six years ago.\nLast month, researcher IDC portrayed the overall tablet market as in a \"spiraling decline,\" and said Apple's flagship was starting to \"show signs of age.\" IDC forecast that tablet sales declines would continue through 2021.\nHow will Apple tackle its iPad problem? Gottheil assumed it will hold to its core strategy of producing integrated hardware and software at a premium price. \"That's a good, solid business,\" he pointed out with a nod to the $19 billion in revenue during 2016. \"But is it ever going to explode again? No.\"\nIn January, Cook used a company-standard line when answering a question about the iPad. \"If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad,\" Cook pledged. To Apple's executives, there's always something around the corner, even if that corner is shrouded in mystery or further away than expected.\nO'Donnell was more matter-of-fact. \"People have not felt the need to upgrade their iPads. But [more screen sizes] may stem the bleeding,\" he suggested.\nComputerworld/Data: Apple\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-15T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

The two died in a shootout with police later that day. Authorities quickly labeled them terrorists.\nIn March 2016, after weeks of wrangling with Apple, which balked at a court order compelling it to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone, the agency announced it had found a way to access the device without Apple's help . Although the FBI acknowledged it had paid an outside group to crack the iPhone, it refused to identify the firm or how much it paid.\nThree news organizations -- the Associated Press wire service, the USA Today newspaper, and Vice Media -- later filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for that information, and more. When the FBI redacted the tool's maker and what the agency paid, the news trio objected. In Monday's filing, government attorneys asked a federal judge to uphold the redactions.\nRELATED: Apple's Mobility Partner Program comes out of hiding\nThey contended that both the vendor's identity and the price the FBI paid might be used by criminals or foreign intelligence services to help assemble a more complete picture of the tool's efficacy and divine the government's security priorities.\nInformation, including the exact workings of the technique used to hack Farook's iPhone, might be stolen if the hack's maker was made public, the DOJ continued.\n\"Revealing the vendor's identity immediately exposes the vendor to attacks and infiltration by hostile entities willing to exploit the technology they provided to the FBI,\" wrote David Hardy, a FBI section chief responsible for record dissemination, in a supporting declaration. \"Since the same proprietary technology now owned by the FBI is also stored within the vendor's facilities and computer systems, the security of this technology would only be as good as the vendor's own security measures.\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-14T17:10:00Z", "images": []}

We\u2019re talking carrier-based cellular service extensions, cable companies looking to get into wireless as well as private LTE networks within enterprises, sports stadiums and conference centers.

Even now, more trials and government approvals will be required before CBRS spectrum, long reserved for specialized users such as the U.S. Navy and satellite service providers, can be employed commercially. But early rollouts are expected by year-end, so it's essentially full speed ahead for CBRS.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\n* The CBRS Alliance announced that all of the Big 4 U.S. carriers have now joined its ranks, as has Samsung, bringing the total number of members near 40. The Alliance was formally introduced in February of 2016 with six founding members who had come together the previous summer, and has since added the likes of Cisco, Huawei and Comcast.\n* Qualcomm and Nokia, two of those founding CBRS Alliance members, along with GE Digital, announced a private LTE-based trial network for industrial IoT. Qualcomm and Nokia also joined forces with Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s Access Group to demo a private LTE network over CBRS spectrum at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where fans were taken inside race cars via 360-degree virtual reality.\n* Alphabet\u2019s Access team \u00a0demonstrated a handful of consumer gear such as smartphones and Mi-Fi devices working with CBRS base stations and launched a program for testing whether CBRS base stations work with its Spectrum Access System (SAS).\n*Federated Wireless, another of the founding CBRS Alliance members, disclosed that it has received conditional certification from the FCC for its cloud-based spectrum controller for enabling CBRS deployments. \u00a0Federated also revealed it is partnering with Nokia to provide a CBRS-based LTE offering, and has tested its SAS with radio gear from Ericsson.\u00a0(See also: \" The wireless spectrum sharing mover and shaker you might not know \")\n* The Small Cell Forum and CBRS Alliance, whose members and focus overlap to some degree, are working on a liaison agreement, according to the former.\n*A slew of vendors, including Accelleran, Ruckus Wireless and SpiderCloud Wireless, all had CBRS-related demos at Mobile World Congress .\nCBRS ALLIES\nNeville Meijers, VP of Business Development at Qualcomm Technologies and chairman of the board for the CBRS Alliance, says \u201coperators are looking at [CBRS] for additional allocation of spectrum they can utilize for broadband -- some fixed, some mobile -- and there are a number of ideas around private LTE networks with respect to campuses, enterprises and industrial IoT\u2026 This is a near-term opportunity\u201d (See our interview with CBRS Alliance Chair Meijers here ). A Verizon VP last week told Fierce Wireless that the carrier plans to use 3.5 GHz spectrum \u201cas soon as practically possible,\u201d for example.\nCBRS Alliance/Qualcomm\nCBRS Alliance Chairman Neville Meijers: \"A lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band.\"\nCBRS will attract providers who already own spectrum, including those dabbling in LTE-U services that share spectrum used by Wi-Fi networks , as well as those who don\u2019t own spectrum, Meijers says. Coverage will easily handle the inside of a home and require just a couple of small cells in an enterprise; outdoors, line-of-sight distances supported could extend beyond a mile.\nThe 3.5 GHz (3550-3700 MHz) band at the heart of CBRS has been identified by the FCC as an underused resource, but one that still needs to be handled smartly to avoid any possible interference with applications by incumbents. So the FCC has put rules in place requiring SAS and environmental sensory networks to manage the fair and safe use of the spectrum both by Priority Access License holders to be determined via an auction likely to be held in 2018 or 2019 and by everyone else, lumped into the General Authorized Access bucket. Google and Federated Wireless are the first two outfits to jump into the spectrum management pool, and have begun testing their offerings with one another as well as with other assorted vendors in the wireless market.\u00a0\nMORE: Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown\nThe FCC has already been doling out licenses for vendors to perform trials, and is working with the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) to come up with an equipment certification process for later this year. As William Graff,\u00a0\u200eGlobal TCB Program Manager at testing laboratory TUV Rheinland , says: It's a challenge building \u201cradios smart enough to wake up, listen before they talk and figure out how not to stomp on each other.\u201d\nThe CBRS Alliance will add an extra layer of certification to ensure that LTE providers in this spectrum band won\u2019t mess up each other\u2019s services.\nWhile chipmakers, service providers and other equipment makers have been among the earliest supporters of CBRS, end user device makers have been slower to embrace the opportunity, at least publicly. Apple, HP and Lenovo are among those that have not signed on as alliance members.\nOne reason for that could be that the FCC hasn\u2019t provided a lot of information on exactly what equipment makers will need to do to make their products work in 3.5 GHz environments. \u201cI just had a question from one of my clients \u2013 and I went and sent something right to the FCC -- about the implementation of Part 96 [of the FCC rules] and whether people who have Part 90 stations are going to have to flip them into Part 96 and in what time period,\u201d says TUV\u2019s Graff. In theory, manufacturers with Part 90 radios might be able to just change out some of the logic to comply, he says.\nCBRS Alliance\u2019s Meijers says: \u00a0\u201cIf the big handset vendors support the band then there will be a rich and robust handset ecosystem, and that is largely driven by the large mobile network operators in terms of specifying their own device requirements. But outside of that there are a lot of device manufacturers who are interested in providing modules for IoT purposes or tablets or laptops that would also be connected into the network.\u201d\nENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY\nFederated Wireless has been a mover and shaker in CBRS from the start, having written the charter for the CBRS Alliance and recruited Intel and Qualcomm as founding members. The Arlington, Va., company plans to deliver its spectrum controller to existing service providers, cable companies and new managed service providers such as building management companies as well as integrate it with OEM gear such as access points and small cells. Applications such as point-to-multipoint, small cell backhaul and last-mile fiber replacement will emerge first, CEO Tarazi says.\nBut the former Sprint and Nextel VP is particularly bullish on the opportunity for private LTE networks in the 3.5 GHz band and the path such 4G networks could provide to 5G. Private LTE networks supporting IoT applications in factories and refineries could very well start emerging late this year or early next year, Tarazi says.\nFederated Wireless\nFederated Wireless CEO Iyad Tarazi: \"If anyone would tell you today there is too much spectrum available... we'd all laugh.\"\nIt was important to get Intel involved in CBRS from the start, Tarazi says, to ensure 3.5 GHz technology would get built for general purpose computing devices such as laptops in much the same way Wi-Fi support did. \u201cThis is not some kind of closed carrier system,\u201d he says.\nThat\u2019s crucial in that the 3.5 GHz band is actually shaping up as a 5G wireless band in other countries that didn\u2019t have the spectrum allocated for specific applications as the United States did. \u201cThis sharing system allows the United States to participate in 5G over time\u2026 and have global coordination and harmonization,\u201d Tarazi says. \u201cBoth Intel and Qualcomm have announced chipsets that are compatible with 5G that are in the 3.5 GHz band.\u201d\nTarazi foresees 4G services up to 1Gbps and 5G services 5 to 10 times that, especially for outdoor point-to-point and last-mile replacement purposes. Private LTE services will blow away Wi-Fi for applications such as streaming 4K video, he claims.\nThe hope is that if resource sharing in the 3.5 GHz band pans out that lots more spectrum will be freed up for sharing.\nAnd that goes beyond the United States. Meijers of the CBRS Alliance says the world is watching how the U.S. 3.5 GHz experience goes.\n\"There is really very little spectrum under 6 GHz and even in millimeter wave that can be cleared very quickly and licensed out,\" he says. \"So the shared model is one that a lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band to actually prove out. And if we are able to prove out that people can utilize the spectrum efficiently and fairly, then I think a lot of regulators would be extremely interested to deploy the same kind of model to free up shared spectrum in their own markets, whether it be in LTE or 5G in the future.\"\nThis story, \"CBRS: Your ticket for building a private enterprise LTE wireless network\" was originally published by Network World\n.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-14T13:45:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "FAQ: What in the wireless world is CBRS?", "content": "FAQ: What in the wireless world is CBRS?\nExplainer on the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) shared spectrum in the 3.5 GHz \"innovation band\"\nEmail a friend\nUse commas to separate multiple email addresses\nFrom\nYour message has been sent.\nSorry\nGet 90% Off Your First Year of RemotePC, Up To 50 Computers for $6.95\nFirst off, CBRS is an acronym for Citizens Broadband Radio Service, and the upshot for enterprise IT pros is that it could result in improved LTE services from service providers as well as enable enterprises to build their own private LTE networks (See also: \"The big CBRS promise: Private LTE networks\" ). Here\u2019s a primer on CBRS \u2014 because you are going to want to know about this.\nCitizens Band/CB, as in CB radio?\nNo, good buddy, this has nothing to do with the Citizens\u2019 Band radio service used by truckers for two-way voice communications and that lives in the 27 MHz spectrum band in the U.S. \u00a0CBRS lives in the 3.5 GHz band.\nHow did the 3.5 GHz band suddenly become available for new commercial services? Isn\u2019t spectrum a super scarce resource?\nThe freeing up of the 3550-3700 MHz band stems from the 2010 National Broadband Plan issued by the FCC, which set out to make 500 MHz of additional spectrum available for new mobile uses. The FCC zeroed in on the 3.5 GHz band (which has dubbed the \"innovation band\") in rules issued in April of 2015 , then reaffirmed those rules about a year later .\nAren\u2019t the previous users of this spectrum band bummed out now?\u00a0\nThey\u2019ll deal with it. A portion of the 150 MHz of spectrum in question has been used by the U.S. Navy, satellite service providers and utilities, but protections have been built into the CBRS rules to safeguard this Incumbent class of spectrum users. Spectrum Access System (known as SAS) and Environmental Sensing Capability services must be implemented to avoid any possible interference between users. Other classes of users are being designated Priority Access and General Authorized Access, the former of which will gain this privilege via a spectrum license auction for Priority Access Licenses (PALs) expected to take place either in 2018 or 2019.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\nSo who\u2019s going to use this spectrum?\nCarriers look forward to extending coverage and capacity of their LTE services via the 3.5 GHz band. As we know from their efforts to horn in on the 5 GHz band used for Wi-Fi via a technology called LTE-U , carriers seek access to more spectrum. But cable operators looking to get into wireless also want in on this action, as will assorted managed service providers, which could include building management companies. What\u2019s more, enterprises could use the spectrum to set up their own LTE networks, including to support internet of things devices. LTE services in the 3.5 GHz band will work indoors and outdoors.\nWhat sort of applications will CBRS be used for?\nService providers are expected to use CBRS to replace last-mile fiber access, deliver fixed wireless services and even point-to-multipoint offerings. Enterprises and managed service providers could exploit the 3.5 GHz band for IoT connectivity and even for Wi-Fi replacement or supplementary services. LTE services could hit 1Gbps indoors and maybe 5 or 10 times that for outdoor uses with line-of-sight access. CBRS backers say the economics of this technology are much better than those of distributed antenna systems and they contend the speed and consistency of service will be much better than Wi-Fi. CBRS supporters also say imaginative new services will be enabled by availability of more cheap spectrum: Nokia, Qualcomm and Google parent Alphabet\u2019s Access group recently demoed a private LTE network over CBRS at Las Vegas Motor Speedway designed to give fans a 360-degree virtual reality view into speeding race cars in real time.\u00a0\nWhere will software, equipment and services come from to support all this?\nHere\u2019s one clue: Almost 40 vendors, from the Big 4 carriers to service provider equipment vendors Ericsson and Nokia to enterprise equipment companies like Cisco and Ruckus to chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm have banded together in the CBRS Alliance \u00a0(See also: CBRS Alliance Chair calls 3.5 GHz shared spectrum \"a near-term opportunity\" ). Look for smartphone and computer makers to join too, once carriers make their requirements clear. Samsung already belongs to the CBRS Alliance. Apple? \u201cApple will follow the market. Apple will get here,\u201d says Iyad Tarazi, CEO of CBRS Alliance founding member Federated Wireless (See also: \" The wireless spectrum sharing mover and shaker you might not know \"). \u201cWe\u2019ve been careful at this stage not to focus on the handset makers because that relationship is typically owned by the carriers. What we have focused on is making sure the chipsets and modems and all of the capabilities are coming this way.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the timeframe for CBRS from here?\nThe FCC has doled out licenses for vendors to conduct CBRS trials, and some of these companies showed off their wares at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier in 2017. The FCC is expected to begin certifying equipment later this year, working with the Wireless Innovation Forum , which boasts\u00a0250 active participants from 60-plus organizations including service providers, SAS administrators, equipment manufacturers, incumbents and government agencies. The\u00a0CBRS Alliance plans to provide an added layer of certification for service providers before long as well. So expect CBRS network rollouts by the second half of 2017.\u00a0\nWill changes in the FCC\u2019s leadership have any impact on CBRS?\nWhile the FCC under new Chairman Ajit Pai has embarked on a course to undo data privacy, net neutrality and other rules put into effect during the Obama administration, CBRS supporters claim they feel comfortable that the commission will not mess with CBRS to any large degree. Pai and fellow Republican FCC member Michael O\u2019Rielly both initially voiced concerns about the 3.5 GHz shared spectrum rules, though did go along with the eventual plan as part of a unanimous ruling. The fact that the FCC did recently give the go-ahead to cellular base stations from Nokia and Ericsson for use in LTE-U networks , indicates support for shared spectrum endeavors. There could be tweaks forthcoming to the Priority Access License plans though.\nWhat's all this mean for 5G wireless?\nWhile the initial talk about CBRS focuses on 4G LTE services, there are no restrictions on using the 3.5 GHz band for 5G services as they emerge. In fact, it's quite likely that the band will be used for 5G, and that might synch nicely with services offered in other countries that are actually targeting the band for 5G services. What's more, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is making moves to enable 5G radios to work in shared spectrum environments.\nWANT TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON CBRS?

{"title": "Cobalt's surge attracts string of market hopefuls", "content": "Larger text size\nVery large text size\nLike moths drawn irresistibly to light, the surge in the price of cobalt over the past few months has sponsored a couple of quick sharemarket floats and a rush of explorers hoping to latch onto the latest signs of life among some of the more exotic metals.\nJust as lithium has won a lot of speculative investor support on the back of the prospects of rising demand with increased battery usage thanks to electric cars, even though any demand from this source is a decade away, at the very least, now it is cobalt's turn.\nDiggers gather at the Tilwezembe cobalt mine outside Kolwezi. Miners make an average of $2 or $3 a day.\nCredit:Michael Robinson Chavez\nAlso giving cobalt a lift was the criticism of Apple Computer for sourcing its supplies of the material from uncontrolled mines in Congo, along with security issues in parts of that country that have raised additional questions over the security of supply.\nApple has said it will tighten control over its purchases of cobalt to avoid both child labour and harsh working conditions, although it has also said it wants to avoid causing too much disruption to the miners who need the income from supplying the high-tech giant.\nAdvertisement\nIn the process, the price of cobalt has surged around 40 per cent over the past few months to more than $50,000 a tonne, with the speed of the rally catching may in the market by surprise.\nSo, for a material that has been mostly an unwanted byproduct of nickel or copper mines, with usually very little value, the surge in its price has raised the prospect that standalone cobalt mines could be developed if the price rise proves to be sustained.\nGeoff Hill, long-time investment banker and corporate adviser, initially to John Spalvins who spun a tug boat operator in Adelaide to a sprawling conglomerate owning breweries and department stores last century, was quick out of the blocks, launching a $10 million raising for Cobalt Blue. It was issuing shares at 20\u00a2 in February that are now trading at more than 30\u00a2.\nDitto for Ardea Resources, which also issued shares last month at 20\u00a2 which are trading at more than 50\u00a2 a piece after a recent run to more than 90\u00a2. It was spun out of Heron Resources, and it is already touting a pre-feasibility study on some cobalt-nickel acreage near Kalgoorlie, which it is calling the \"largest resource in the developed world\".\nA host of others have figured out that pegging cobalt acreage might just give their share price sufficient lift to justify a quick fund-raising so they can eke out another few months of life. Last Tuesday, it was Latin American Resources disclosing acreage in Argentina and later in the week Cohiba\u200b Minerals was updating the market on some acreage it is looking at.\n\"There are a lot of companies looking at the potential, with what they've got,\" said Mike Millikan, analyst with Hartley, pointing to Independence Group with its Nova project. \"At the moment there is a lot of interest but it is anyone's guess how long it will last.\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-12T09:21:25Z", "images": []}

At the time, Apple\u00a0denied any involvement and said that \u201cretailers set their own prices\u201d for the products.\nNow, Russia\u2019s Federal Antimonopoly Service, however, has found Apple guilty\u00a0of price-fixing in the country\u2026\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\nAs noted by The Financial\u00a0Times , Russia\u2019s Federal Antimonopoly Service found that Apple had illegally ordered retailers to fix prices of the iPhone 5\u00a0and iPhone 6 models. Specifically, Apple apparently instructed 16 retailers in Russia to set the prices at a certain amount and if a retailer was found to be selling the iPhone at an \u201cunsuitable\u201d price, Apple would contact them and order them to change the price or risk having the sales agreement terminated.\nIn a statement , the FAS had the following to say, translated:\nThe investigation revealed that since the start of official sales in Russia of the Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, most resellers installed the same prices on them as recommended by Apple Rus and supported them for\u00a0about 3 months.\nAt the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in caseof setting \u201cunsuitable\u201d prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers.\nApple has yet to comment on the ruling, but FAS head\u00a0Andrey Tsarikovsky explained that Apple has \u201cactively cooperated\u201d with the agency to resolve wrongdoings:\n\u201cIn the course of the proceedings the Russian subsidiary of Apple actively co-operated with the FAS,\u201d said the agency\u2019s deputy head, Andrey Tsarikovsky. \u201cThe company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear at this point what sort of punishment Apple could face for its price-fixing in Russia.

{"title": "Zenefits founder Parker Conrad takes another crack at HR onboarding", "content": "Matthew Lynley @mattlynley / 2 years\nParker Conrad\u2019s last venture at Zenefits didn\u2019t end so well, what with his departure as CEO and the company having to re-orient itself . But he\u2019s once again starting a company that will figure out how to build an employee system of record and management, starting off with smoothing out the process of onboarding employees and focusing on other major life events for those employees.\nConrad\u2019s new company is called Rippling , which is launching today. The goal is to turn the process of bringing on an employee and assigning them hardware and the services they\u2019ll need to operate \u2014 like Gmail or Salesforce \u2014 right away. Rippling integrates with a bunch of major services on the back-end and automatically assigns those accounts to new employees, and also helps managers set up payroll in several states.\n[Update 10/10/18: Rippling has now launched its full-fledged employee management system combining HR, IT, and security tools to eliminate busywork.]\nZenefits\u2019 Parker Conrad returns with Rippling to kill HR & IT busywork\nBy doing that, Rippling becomes a store of information for all the details\u00a0about that employee. Rippling assigns the computer, so it\u2019s able to remotely manage and observe the health and status of that computer. It assigns which groups are available in Salesforce, so it can manage the security of those accounts and who gets to use them. And it can quickly turn off those services, looking to also smooth out the process of off-boarding an employee who\u2019s on the way out.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure as I\u2019d describe it as a wedge into something else,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cThe reason I believe it\u2019s critical is because if you are the system a company\u00a0uses for onboarding\u00a0new employees and setting them up in different systems, it makes you into the system of record for employee data by definition. That\u2019s because\u00a0of the fact you\u2019re literally ingesting all the different attributes that make up that employee record.\u201d\nRippling is designed to not only help managers deal with those life events \u2014 like a raise or sending an offer letter \u2014 but also quickly integrate new services. The hope is that instead of having to add new services that employees will use fully manually, there will be processes in place that make it easier to essentially on-board those new services into its suite through a series of categorizations. Automating all of this, at the end of the day, is the goal in order to scale up everything.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really if you scale things up manually, one of the things, the mistakes we made or I made, is, if you scale things up manually you can come back and automate them later,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cThe difficulty of automating a manual process, I\u2019m convinced it grows not just with the employees doing that manual process but as the square of that difficulty.\u00a0It\u2019s very hard to write down the spec to automate it completely. You have to start automating things when it\u2019s done at a small scale or you\u2019re screwed.\u201d\nAll of this is processed down to the point that the offer letter is algorithmically generated, ending up with a Mad Libs-style letter with different fields that sync up to the boxes a manager ticked as they went through the process. Managers select the role, the department, what the compensation is, how many shares and so on. These processes are\u00a0then detailed in the checklist, with Rippling handling sending employees and getting them to sign their documents.\nConrad seems to want to keep focusing on the problem because he\u2019s continually run into issues around it \u2014 especially at Zenefits when the company was growing at a break-neck pace. Early in Zenefits\u2019 life, Conrad was running to the Apple Store or ordering computers off Amazon and basically handing them out to employees. In the first day, one new employee (of around the first 10) who had been given a laptop had already been locked out of their computer. The password hint, \u201cMark McGuire,\u201d wasn\u2019t helpful either. And because there were no systems in place to manage that laptop, the employee ended up coming in every day with an iPad and a keyboard after that.\n\u201cEventually I was like, dude you\u2019re on your own,\u201d Conrad said of dealing as a manager with a fast-growing and small team. \u201cIf we were using Rippling you just go into hardware here and I can click right here on their\u00a0computer and reset their\u00a0user account right here. We\u2019d have a bunch of people starting Monday\u00a0and I\u2019d run to the Apple Store\u00a0to buy a bunch of laptops the night before.\u201d\nAll of this still needs to be viewed under the lens of what happened at Zenefits, though Conrad laid out a few things he\u2019s trying to do differently this time around. For one, the company has already hired a CFO and is looking for a general counsel early\u00a0as it looks to scale up \u2014 such as expanding to new states through payroll and other more legally hairy situations. That was a major failure of Zenefits, as it was slammed for compliance issues with Conrad resigning after that.\nStill, around 90 percent of Rippling\u2019s investors also invested in Zenefits\u00a0\u2014 which happened around two weeks ago. The team already has around 12 engineers, he said, and it seems this time around Conrad is looking for a more calculated approach after the mayhem of Zenefits, which very quickly hit a $4.5 billion valuation and was on track to be one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses ever.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just investing a lot more in infrastructure up front, both on the engineering side and on others,\u201d Conrad said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s understanding the sort of complexities of growing a business and what\u2019s around the corner as you grow and the challenges that emerge. I have a much bigger appreciation for getting infrastructure\u00a0in place, the scaffolding on the tech side but also the company itself, in place early. We\u2019ve been ahead of what\u2019s around the corner, so that things\u00a0are set up correctly.\u201d\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-14T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

But with the new administration in place, a few things have changed: The group will be about four times its usual size, organizers say, and members feel a heightened sense of urgency to be heard by an administration that was largely opposed by Silicon Valley last November.\n\u201cWe have never had a more robust response to participate from CEOs than this year,\u201d said Carl Guardino, who heads the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. \u201cThis moment of time is critical.\u201d\nThe delegation will meet with Democratic and Republican members of Congress and administration officials. Joining the group will be nearly 90 Bay Area leaders, ranging from startup CEOs to the mayors of San Jose, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale.\nAmong those attending is Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank. While the group\u2019s list of priorities has not changed much from previous years, Becker said, leaders are mindful of which points are likely to get support from the administration.\nThat means corporate tax reform \u2014 which President Trump championed during his campaign \u2014 will be at the top of the list, Becker said. The tech sector has long called for reform of the tax code, which it says is complex, chaotic and has hurt American competitiveness.\nLower on the list will be immigration reform. Silicon Valley companies have long complained about the limited number of H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, whom tech firms rely on to fill many engineering positions. Despite Trump\u2019s calls for a merit-based immigration system , his immigrant and refugee travel ban has left executives jittery about the the future of the H-1B visa program.\nHowever, with any significant expansion of work visas unlikely under Trump, the group\u2019s focus will be on making sure the administration doesn\u2019t \u201cmake anything worse,\u201d Becker said.\nAlso looming large on the trip is the issue of federal funding for improving Caltrain, the heavily used commuter rail system between the South Bay and San Francisco.\nThe Silicon Valley Leadership Group has long lobbied for local, state and federal funding for this project, which would replace the system\u2019s diesel equipment with electric trains.

We\u2019re talking carrier-based cellular service extensions, cable companies looking to get into wireless as well as private LTE networks within enterprises, sports stadiums and conference centers. Such services promise to complement -- and in some cases replace -- Wi-Fi, as well as pave the way for 5G wireless services. (See also: \"FAQ: What in the wireless world is CBRS?\" )\n\u201c3.5 has pretty good potential to disrupt the enterprise market,\u201d says consultant Chetan Sharma , fresh off surveying the scene at the big Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. \u201cIt has much better performance [than the alternatives].\u201d\n[ Check out our hands-on reviews: 5 top hardware-based Wi-Fi test tools and Mojo wireless intrusion prevention system . ]\nAdds Iyad Tarazi, CEO of CBRS player Federated Wireless: \"A lot of the hurdles to creating a private LTE system are going away.\"\nGiven that CBRS involves an innovative new spectrum sharing scheme, it has had to overcome early skepticism, such as from the WiMAX Forum and certain entities in the utility industry . Even now, more trials and government approvals will be required before CBRS spectrum, long reserved for specialized users such as the U.S. Navy and satellite service providers, can be employed commercially. But early rollouts are expected by year-end, so it's essentially full speed ahead for CBRS.\n[ Take this mobile device management course from PluralSight and learn how to secure devices in your company without degrading the user experience. ]\n* The CBRS Alliance announced that all of the Big 4 U.S. carriers have now joined its ranks, as has Samsung, bringing the total number of members near 40. The Alliance was formally introduced in February of 2016 with six founding members who had come together the previous summer, and has since added the likes of Cisco, Huawei and Comcast.\n* Qualcomm and Nokia, two of those founding CBRS Alliance members, along with GE Digital, announced a private LTE-based trial network for industrial IoT. Qualcomm and Nokia also joined forces with Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s Access Group to demo a private LTE network over CBRS spectrum at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where fans were taken inside race cars via 360-degree virtual reality.\n* Alphabet\u2019s Access team \u00a0demonstrated a handful of consumer gear such as smartphones and Mi-Fi devices working with CBRS base stations and launched a program for testing whether CBRS base stations work with its Spectrum Access System (SAS).\n*Federated Wireless, another of the founding CBRS Alliance members, disclosed that it has received conditional certification from the FCC for its cloud-based spectrum controller for enabling CBRS deployments. \u00a0Federated also revealed it is partnering with Nokia to provide a CBRS-based LTE offering, and has tested its SAS with radio gear from Ericsson.\u00a0(See also: \" The wireless spectrum sharing mover and shaker you might not know \")\n* The Small Cell Forum and CBRS Alliance, whose members and focus overlap to some degree, are working on a liaison agreement, according to the former.\n*A slew of vendors, including Accelleran, Ruckus Wireless and SpiderCloud Wireless, all had CBRS-related demos at Mobile World Congress .\nCBRS ALLIES\nNeville Meijers, VP of Business Development at Qualcomm Technologies and chairman of the board for the CBRS Alliance, says \u201coperators are looking at [CBRS] for additional allocation of spectrum they can utilize for broadband -- some fixed, some mobile -- and there are a number of ideas around private LTE networks with respect to campuses, enterprises and industrial IoT\u2026 This is a near-term opportunity\u201d (See our interview with CBRS Alliance Chair Meijers here ). A Verizon VP last week told Fierce Wireless that the carrier plans to use 3.5 GHz spectrum \u201cas soon as practically possible,\u201d for example.\nCBRS Alliance/Qualcomm\nCBRS Alliance Chairman Neville Meijers: \"A lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band.\"\nCBRS will attract providers who already own spectrum, including those dabbling in LTE-U services that share spectrum used by Wi-Fi networks , as well as those who don\u2019t own spectrum, Meijers says. Coverage will easily handle the inside of a home and require just a couple of small cells in an enterprise; outdoors, line-of-sight distances supported could extend beyond a mile.\nThe 3.5 GHz (3550-3700 MHz) band at the heart of CBRS has been identified by the FCC as an underused resource, but one that still needs to be handled smartly to avoid any possible interference with applications by incumbents. So the FCC has put rules in place requiring SAS and environmental sensory networks to manage the fair and safe use of the spectrum both by Priority Access License holders to be determined via an auction likely to be held in 2018 or 2019 and by everyone else, lumped into the General Authorized Access bucket. Google and Federated Wireless are the first two outfits to jump into the spectrum management pool, and have begun testing their offerings with one another as well as with other assorted vendors in the wireless market.\u00a0\nMORE: Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown\nThe FCC has already been doling out licenses for vendors to perform trials, and is working with the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) to come up with an equipment certification process for later this year. As William Graff,\u00a0\u200eGlobal TCB Program Manager at testing laboratory TUV Rheinland , says: It's a challenge building \u201cradios smart enough to wake up, listen before they talk and figure out how not to stomp on each other.\u201d\nThe CBRS Alliance will add an extra layer of certification to ensure that LTE providers in this spectrum band won\u2019t mess up each other\u2019s services.\nWhile chipmakers, service providers and other equipment makers have been among the earliest supporters of CBRS, end user device makers have been slower to embrace the opportunity, at least publicly. Apple, HP and Lenovo are among those that have not signed on as alliance members.\nOne reason for that could be that the FCC hasn\u2019t provided a lot of information on exactly what equipment makers will need to do to make their products work in 3.5 GHz environments. \u201cI just had a question from one of my clients \u2013 and I went and sent something right to the FCC -- about the implementation of Part 96 [of the FCC rules] and whether people who have Part 90 stations are going to have to flip them into Part 96 and in what time period,\u201d says TUV\u2019s Graff. In theory, manufacturers with Part 90 radios might be able to just change out some of the logic to comply, he says.\nCBRS Alliance\u2019s Meijers says: \u00a0\u201cIf the big handset vendors support the band then there will be a rich and robust handset ecosystem, and that is largely driven by the large mobile network operators in terms of specifying their own device requirements. But outside of that there are a lot of device manufacturers who are interested in providing modules for IoT purposes or tablets or laptops that would also be connected into the network.\u201d\nENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY\nFederated Wireless has been a mover and shaker in CBRS from the start, having written the charter for the CBRS Alliance and recruited Intel and Qualcomm as founding members. The Arlington, Va., company plans to deliver its spectrum controller to existing service providers, cable companies and new managed service providers such as building management companies as well as integrate it with OEM gear such as access points and small cells. Applications such as point-to-multipoint, small cell backhaul and last-mile fiber replacement will emerge first, CEO Tarazi says.\nBut the former Sprint and Nextel VP is particularly bullish on the opportunity for private LTE networks in the 3.5 GHz band and the path such 4G networks could provide to 5G. Private LTE networks supporting IoT applications in factories and refineries could very well start emerging late this year or early next year, Tarazi says.\nFederated Wireless\nFederated Wireless CEO Iyad Tarazi: \"If anyone would tell you today there is too much spectrum available... we'd all laugh.\"\nIt was important to get Intel involved in CBRS from the start, Tarazi says, to ensure 3.5 GHz technology would get built for general purpose computing devices such as laptops in much the same way Wi-Fi support did. \u201cThis is not some kind of closed carrier system,\u201d he says.\nThat\u2019s crucial in that the 3.5 GHz band is actually shaping up as a 5G wireless band in other countries that didn\u2019t have the spectrum allocated for specific applications as the United States did. \u201cThis sharing system allows the United States to participate in 5G over time\u2026 and have global coordination and harmonization,\u201d Tarazi says. \u201cBoth Intel and Qualcomm have announced chipsets that are compatible with 5G that are in the 3.5 GHz band.\u201d\nTarazi foresees 4G services up to 1Gbps and 5G services 5 to 10 times that, especially for outdoor point-to-point and last-mile replacement purposes. Private LTE services will blow away Wi-Fi for applications such as streaming 4K video, he claims.\nThe hope is that if resource sharing in the 3.5 GHz band pans out that lots more spectrum will be freed up for sharing.\nAnd that goes beyond the United States. Meijers of the CBRS Alliance says the world is watching how the U.S. 3.5 GHz experience goes.\n\"There is really very little spectrum under 6 GHz and even in millimeter wave that can be cleared very quickly and licensed out,\" he says. \"So the shared model is one that a lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band to actually prove out. And if we are able to prove out that people can utilize the spectrum efficiently and fairly, then I think a lot of regulators would be extremely interested to deploy the same kind of model to free up shared spectrum in their own markets, whether it be in LTE or 5G in the future.\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-14T13:45:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Google, Levi's smart jacket shows what's coming next for wearables", "content": "Larger text size\nVery large text size\nGoogle and Levi's showed off this week a new joint project: a $350 smart jean jacket. While this jacket literally puts tech on your sleeve, it does it in a subtle way that doesn't require putting another screen on your body. In doing so, it offers a glimpse of what smart fabrics can do and of the evolution of the wearables market -- one in which consumers won't have to wear a clunky accessory that screams high tech.\nThe smart Commuter jacket, which was introduced over the weekend at SXSW in Austin, is aimed at those who bike to work. It has technology woven into its fibres, and allows users to take phone calls, get directions and check the time, by tapping and swiping their sleeves. That delivers information to them through their headphones so that they can keep their eyes on the road without having to fiddle with a screen. The jacket should hit stores this fall.\nThe smart Commuter jacket, which was introduced over the weekend at SXSW in Austin, is aimed at those who bike to work.\nIts smart fibres are washable; they're powered by a sort of smart cufflink that you'll have to remove when you wash the jacket. The cufflink has a two-day battery life.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the idea of a smart jean jacket may not appeal to everyone (especially on a hot summer day), the existence of such a jacket is telling about where the market may be going.\n\"I think that the commuter jacket from Levi's is really perfect because it's focused on a single consumer audience. It has the cyclist in mind and is targeting what their needs are,\" said Sidney Morgan-Petro, retail editor at trend forecasting firm WGSN.\nShe said that what makes the Commuter jacket different from other wearables -- and even other smart clothing -- is that it's not necessarily marketing the tech as its main feature, but rather using it to solve problems that everyday people have. Many smartwatches and even other smart clothing can feel like solutions in search of a problem to solve. The Commuter jacket, she said, stands out as a type of wearable for a more everyday consumer who may not be that interested in the tech, but likes the practical features that come with a stylish jacket.\nWearables are expected to be a $19 billion industry by 2018, according to Juniper Research. Products including Fitbit fitness trackers, Android Wear watches and the Apple Watch have helped fuel a rise in mainstream awareness of wearables for the past several years, even leading Fitbit to go public in 2015. But the market for wearables has taken a bit of a tumble in the past few quarters. Fitbit in January announced it had missed earnings expectations and starting cutting jobs because sales were lower than expected.\nIt's hard to say exactly what has caused the cool-down in wearables, but one possibility is that the market for uber-techy wearables that try to put a smartwatch on your wrist is pretty saturated. Analysts have pointed to a shift in the market away from the super-functional smartwatch toward gadgets that are a little more focused and better looking to boot.\n\"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme,\" Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for the analysis firm International Data Corp., said in a December report. \"From a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\"\nThe partnership between Google and Levi's speaks to that growing effort between the technology and fashion industries. Several designers have already partnered with the likes of Fitbit and Apple to make their wearables more chic and less geek. Companies including Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren and Under Armour have released smart activewear; seeing a brand as old and mainstream as Levi's get in on the act illustrates just how pervasive the idea has become.\n\"The retail opportunity is huge,\" Morgan-Petro said. \"We're basically seeing clothes as the future of wearables.\"\nWashington Post\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-15T22:03:05Z", "images": []}

The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated by vendors developing engines, software, and hardware for a device.\nThe report also considers the revenue generated from the various sources such as paid AR apps, advertisements within AR apps, In-app purchases, revenue generated by AR vendors that develop mobile advertisements for third parties such as PepsiCo and Volkswagen, revenue generated by vendors developing AR apps for sectors such as healthcare, retail, real estate, and industrial and sale of HMDs and smart glasses.\nAccording to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is increasing dependence on apps and proliferation of AR apps for numerous activities. A mobile app is a software developed for use in small-sized wireless computing devices such as smartphones and tablets. The large-scale adoption of smartphones globally has increased the use of AR apps. People have become dependent on apps as they make life simple.\nFurther, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is lack of AR content. There are a large number of AR apps available in the market. These apps are developed mostly by individuals and companies. However, the majority of these apps fail to meet user expectations and become a success, thereby reducing the growth potential and acceptance of AR among consumers. The majority of the apps fail to meet customers' expectations because they lack content and do not have the feature of adding new or additional content.\nKey vendors\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-16T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Galaxy S8 to use face recognition for payment, 1000fps slo-mo", "content": "Galaxy S8 to use face recognition for payment, 1000fps slo-mo\nJC Torres - Mar 17, 2017, 2:30 am CST\n0\nUsually, at this point in time, rumors and leaks about the Galaxy S8 should have, more or less, settled down and have been whittled down to a few consistent points. And yet there are now last minute details attempting to still provide some substantial new perspective into the smartphone. \u201cPerspective\u201d is probably apt, considering this is about the Galaxy S8\u2019s imaging capabilities. According to sources, Samsung intends to use a still underutilized facial recognition technology to authorize mobile payments. On the opposite side of the phone, the camera is leaked to be capable of a mind-breaking 1,000 fps slow motion video capture.\nFacial recognition isn\u2019t exactly new on smartphones. Android devices, and some Samsung Galaxy ones in particular, use the technology to unlock smartphones. However, it is generally regarded with some amount of skepticism, considered by the public to be less consistent and less reliable than, say fingerprint scanners.\nSamsung is, apparently, of a different view. According to people familiar with the matter, the OEM intends to use the technology for mobile payments in the coming months. Currently, Samsung Pay already uses fingerprint sensors, but the Galaxy S8 is expected to sport another biometric sensor: iris recognition. This technology was first introduced in the Galaxy Note 7, so it\u2019s not surprising that Samsung would want to try again. Facial recognition, however, is considered by Samsung to be faster than iris recognition, especially when there\u2019s sufficient ambient light. Iris recognition, on the other hand, performs better than face recognition in low light cases.\nAlthough facial recognition technology isn\u2019t as popular just yet, Samsung is said to be a bit desperate to differentiate its Galaxy S8 against competition from all quarters, for Apple to LG to Huawei. Another point of differentiation that Samsung is tipped to be pushing is slow motion video capture. The current standard there is video recording at 180 fps, currently held by the Apple iPhone. 1,000 fps sounds too good to be true, but it does have basis in reality.\nSony\u2019s Xperia XZ Performance, which was unveiled at MWC 2017 last month, already claims 960 fps, but that is capped at 720p resolutions only. In early February, however, Sony announced a new 21.12 megapixel image sensor that it claims can shoot Full HD 1080p videos at an astounding 1,000 fps. It accomplishes this by placing a DRAM, or dynamic RAM, in between the actual CMOS sensor and the circuit responsible for processing. This allows for data to be quickly passed or even held temporarily, making such bursts possible.\nBased on the Korean media report, the Galaxy S8 will utilize a sensor with that same DRAM feature. Chances are, Samsung might actually be using Sony\u2019s image sensor, which it has done in the past. Whether that comes to pass, however, we\u2019ll finally know in less than two weeks.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-17T07:30:37Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple plans to invest $500 million for new research centers in China", "content": "Romain Dillet @romaindillet / 2 years\nApple is trying to tap into local talent by building new research centers around the world. As spotted by MacRumors , the company just announced on its Chinese website that it is going to build two new R&D centers in Shanghai and Suzhou.\nThis is going to be a significant investment as Apple plans to spend 3.5 billion yuan, or a little bit more than $500 million. The company already announced research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen, so there will be four centers in China in total. Apple also has teams in France, Israel,\u00a0the U.K., Japan and Sweden.\nApple said that some of those engineers will work on supply chain improvements. Most of Apple\u2019s products are manufactured in China. And some of the best electronics engineers in the world who can help you ship tens of millions of devices a year also live in China.\nIt could be easier to work on proprietary Chinese protocols with a local team in China as well. Apple needs to make sure that its devices work on all Chinese networks.\nSo it seems logical that Apple would go beyond partnering with local firms in China by creating its own research centers. This way, Apple has a foot on the ground and gets the best of both worlds.\nAs a side effect, Apple shows that it is willing to invest in the Chinese economy. It\u2019s a great way to convince the Chinese government that you deserve favors.\nApple already has many different stores in China. Apple is also the fourth smartphone maker in China behind Oppo, Huawei and Vivo. China is a key market for Apple, and today\u2019s new research centers prove that once again.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-17T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple gives indie gamers a permanent home on the App Store", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nBreaking into the App Store can be difficult enough, but for small-time mobile game developers it\u2019s even more of a challenge as they go up against billion-dollar, global publishers that dominate the top charts, like Supercell, Activision Blizzard, Niantic, EA, Tencent and others that can afford to invest millions in\u00a0marketing budgets and advertising. Apple is now hoping to level the playing field a bit by giving indie games a new and highly visible home on the App Store.\nThroughout the\u00a0week, Apple has been highlighting indie gamer content in a dedicated section on the App Store\u2019s home page, where it often features new releases, favorites, staff picks and other recommendations.\nThis hub, dubbed \u201c Celebrating Indie Games ,\u201d includes a number of new releases and debuts from independent game developers, but also some of the best, all-time titles for iOS gaming. Further down the page, indie games are further broken down into category spotlights \u2014 like lists of those with \u201cincredible sound design\u201d or \u201cunforgettable stories,\u201d for example.\nThe selections were chosen by the App Store\u2019s Editorial team, and include a mix of both paid and free-to-play titles.\nInitially, this collection appeared\u00a0to be just\u00a0another promotion meant to give indie titles a push. Apple often hosts\u00a0featured collections like this on its App Store in order to showcase new releases, interesting apps and other exclusive\u00a0content.\nThe launch of the hub was preceded by other promotions of indie games, including discounts and other prominent placements for new, indie releases. Apple said it would be highlighting indie titles throughout the month, from March 9th through 20th.\nLove the games we\u2019ve debuted? Starting today, we\u2019ll have a permanent\u00a0spot on the App Store just for indie games. https://t.co/M7fhi8kU4D pic.twitter.com/d9Nt98EGvw\n\u2014 App Store Games (@AppStoreGames) March 17, 2017\nHowever, according to a tweet \u00a0posted on Thursday by the App Store Games Twitter account, the indie games hub will\u00a0be a permanent installation on the App Store after the promotional period wraps. In March, Apple suggested it\u2019s\u00a0 refreshing the content in the indie hub daily, but presumably that pace will slow when the \u201cCelebrating Indie Games\u201d push ends.\nFor indie developers \u2014 that is, those that are small, self-published and self-funded, according to Apple\u2019s definition \u00a0\u2014 the change could greatly impact their discoverability on the App Store. A dedicated section for finding these titles offers developers\u00a0a way to get in front of potential new users, without having to pay for App Store Search ads, or other ads on sites like Facebook.\nGames remain one of the most popular categories of apps and account for the majority of App Store revenue. According to data from Sensor Tower, \u00a0more than 80 percent of all money earned through Apple\u2019s App Store came from mobile games in 2016. App Annie\u2019s figures were slightly lower, at 75 percent of all App Store revenue.\nLast year, mobile gaming also was poised\u00a0to\u00a0take a larger share than PC gaming,\u00a0 with $36.9 billion in revenues , up 21.3 percent worldwide, Newzoo\u2019s report said.\nThe promotional efforts seem to be working. Currently, titles like Botnicula, Surgeon Simulator and Prune \u2014 all of which are being featured in the new hub \u2014 are sitting high on the App Store\u2019s Top Paid Apps chart at No. 7, No. 1 and No. 5, respectively.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-17T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

While Cook didn\u2019t address the topic specifically during his speech in China, his comments seem to reflect his viewpoint that China has a strong and developed manufacturing infrastructure and labor force .\nCook will continue his time in China by introducing China\u2019s \u201ctop internet regulator, Xu Lin\u201d in a closed-door meeting between executives. The discussion is said to focus on security and internet regulation, though it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll learn too much about what is said.\nGuides\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-18T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "How Spotify is finally gaining leverage over record labels", "content": "Josh Constine @JoshConstine / 2 years\nThe problem with Spotify going public has always been that the record labels own the music. They force Spotify to pay 70 percent or more of its revenue to them for royalties, and could jack up that price if Spotify got too profitable.\nThat\u2019s why over the past few years, Spotify has been pushing five different paths to putting pressure on the labels to cut it a better royalties deal. They all hinge around the idea of making the labels need Spotify as much as it\u2019s historically needed them.\nWhen Spotify launched in 2008, it had no power in the relationship since it had so few listeners. It needed to raise over $180 million in its first few years and pay the labels a huge upfront advance on royalty payments to convince them to let it launch in the US. Spotify also had to sell the labels equity so even if it succeeded, they\u2019d be financially protected.\nBut now that Spotify has grown to 50 million paid subscribers and a huge base of free ad-supported listeners, it\u2019s emerging from the streaming pack including YouTube / Google Music, Pandora, Apple Music, and Amazon so rights owners can\u2019t just favor them instead. Spotify has\u00a0begun to gain some leverage over the labels so that it can make money without them and they need it to have a hit record.\nHere are the five ways Spotify is weakening the the record companies\u2019 iron grip on music:\nDictating The Top 40\nSpotify\u2019s Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists aren\u2019t just some of its most popular and differentiated features. They give Spotify newfound power to choose what artists and songs a large swath of its listeners hear. Instead of focusing on peer-to-peer sharing or direct channels between the artists and the fans, it\u2019s prioritized music discovery methods that put it in control. Spotify wants to take the place of the thousands of radio stations that record labels typically kiss up to.\nSpotify\u2019s owned playlists like Discovery Weekly let it influence what gets popular\nIf Spotify can use its owned playlists to make or break different artists, it can use this influence to demand better deals from the labels. Record companies that offer it lower royalty rates, don\u2019t do exclusives with its competitors like Apple Music, or get their artists to release special re-recorded Spotify Sessions of their hits could see their artists placed more prominently in Spotify\u2019s playlists and their audiences grow. Labels that don\u2019t play ball with Spotify might sublty notice they\u2019re not getting the same playlist love. Spotify\u2019s already been accused of this retaliatory behavior . Even though it denied the practice , the threat could be enough to coerce the labels.\nScale\nSpotify needs all the major record labels to let it stream their content, otherwise its catalogue would be confusingly incomplete. Most listeners don\u2019t know what artists are on which of the three major labels \u2013 Sony, Warner, and Universal. So the result of any one of them refusing to work with Spotify is that it would make almost a third of its music unavailable, and drive users to its competitors.\nBut that was when Spotify had so few listeners that the labels didn\u2019t need it. Now Spotify contributes a big enough percentage of record labels\u2019 total royalties that they have a lot more to lose from cutting it off. As we said above, their artists would suffer from the loss of distribution, but they\u2019d also suffer a loss of revenue. Spotify\u2019s size has made record labels pulling out into either a bad bet or a bluff.\nDiversifying Beyond Music\nSpotify has to pay out 70 percent of its revenue from major label music, but not from other content types like video and podcasts. That\u2019s partly why Spotify is pouring investment into creating original content like 12 different video series ,\u00a0including Drawn & Recorded about music history. It\u2019s also got a big original podcasts initiative .\nSpotify\u2019s original video series Drawn & Recorded tells tales from music history\nThe more Spotify gets people watching and listening to the content it creates or gets for cheap, the smaller the share of its total earnings it has to pay out to the labels. Meanwhile, it gets to offer exclusive content that doesn\u2019t piss off fans who aren\u2019t subscribed the way Apple Music\u2019s early access to blockbuster albums does. When Spotify first announced it was getting into video, people though it was trying to challenge YouTube or Vevo or even Facebook. Really it just wants to run Netflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things\u201d playbook.\nAccess Restrictions\nThe biggest driver of Spotify\u2019s success has been its free ad-supported tier that serves as a subscriber acquisition funnel. But some labels don\u2019t want their music available to listeners that earn them less per stream than paid subscribers, at least when it first comes out. Now the Financial Times reports Spotify is in negotiations with labels to allow them to withhold top new releases from the free tier in exchange for better royalty rates.\nEssentially, Spotify has built its ad-supported audience to be so big that it can now restrict their access to content as a bargaining chip. Some artists like Taylor Swift have been arguing for this option for years, but now Spotify has the scale to demand a financial incentive in return.\nBecoming A Label\nIf Spotify owns the rights to the music it streams, it\u2019s who earns the royalty payouts. That\u2019s why two sources tell TechCrunch that Spotify has discussed traditional record label-style deals with artists. Musicians who cut these deals could get a cash advance in exchange for Spotify owning a percentage of their recording revenues.\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek\nThese deals could potentially come with exclusivity clauses around when and where the artists could distribute their music elsewhere, but that\u2019s not confirmed. Apple already offers up-front financial compensation in exchange for exclusivity, as Chance The Rapper just revealed he was paid $500,000 and given a commercial to make his album Coloring Book and Apple Music exclusive for the first two weeks. Spotify on the other hand is looking into more inclusive deals that align them with artists\u2019 long-term success.\nPower To The IPO\n\u00a0\nEmploying all these strategies, Spotify is now using its leverage with labels to negotiate lower royalty rates. TechCrunch previously reported that Spotify is considering delaying its IPO until 2018 to allow these sources of leverage to grow so it can score a better deal before going public. Spotify declined to comment on this story.\nWhile at first glance, Spotify paying less for per stream might seem worse for artists trying to make a living on music. But the success of Spotify and the path it could forge for streaming services is also in the interest of those artists. Not only could royalty rates start to climb closer to CD sale revenue if it grows big enough. Spotify is also incentivized to help artists use streaming to promote their merchandise and ticket sales where the bulk of their earnings comes from while it takes a cut. It\u2019s becoming the portal to music.\nNapster made music piracy mainstream and the record labels sued it to death without a replacement causing users to fragment across underground download apps they couldn\u2019t fight. Now 15 years later, convenience has once again depowered record labels in favor of broad access to the pantheon of music. But this time, 50 million people are paying for it.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-18T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Will it make its Apple Pencil stylus compatible with devices other than its high-end iPad Pro tablets?\nI think it should.\nIn 2015, when Apple first unveiled the Pencil , people wondered why the stylus wouldn\u2019t work with non-Pro iPads, let alone iPhones.\nThen, in 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , people wondered why Apple didn\u2019t make the phone capable of supporting the Pencil.\nNow Apple is said to be planning its third iPad Pro. It\u2019s reasonable to expect Pencil support on the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro . But will Apple make an oh-by-the-way announcement about expanded support for Pencil after revealing the new slab? Unlikely.\nIf anything, Apple could finally bring the Pencil outside iPad Pro land in September at its next iPhone event. Will it? I guess so. There will likely be new OLED displays on Apple\u2019s 10th-anniversary iPhone. At the same time as it refreshes the displays, Apple could also introduce technology that can handle the Apple Pencil\u2019s sensors for detecting pressure, angle, and location.\nApple\u2019s closest competitor in the smartphone market is Samsung, whose Galaxy Note phones have for years shipped with a stylus and a nifty, narrow on-board pocket to hold it. Earlier this year, Samsung introduced convertible Android-friendly Chromebooks with that feature, too.\nMust Apple follow Samsung in bringing stylus smarts to its flagship phone? No. Should it?\nWell, look at iPad sales. In the holiday quarter , the most important quarter in Cupertino, iPad revenue was down 22 percent year over year, and iPad unit sales were down 19 percent. Revenue growth for the iPad has been erased \u2014 the single biggest quarter for the iPad, revenue-wise, was back in 2013. The iPhone, meanwhile, is back to growth, with record revenue and unit sales.\nIn 2012, Apple did bring its Siri virtual assistant to the iPad \u2014 the company\u2019s newest device at the time \u2014 after debuting it on the iPhone in 2011.\nNow, after Apple has granted the iPad Pro more than a year of Pencil exclusivity, it would be wise for Apple to start letting consumers decide if they\u2019d like to buy a Pencil for their iPhones \u2014 while the Pencil is still interesting.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-18T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Secretive billionaire Duan Yongping reveals how he toppled Apple in China", "content": "Apple couldn't beat us in China because even they have flaws.\nIn a 2015 post, he argued Apple's profit should reach $US100 billion within five years.\nToday, Duan won't say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple's new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino.\n\"Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,\" Duan said. \"We don't have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.\"\nChina's Warren Buffett\n\u200bOppo's gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China's Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen.\nBorn in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong's Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics.\nDuan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China's Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant.\nHis first product was the \"Subor\" gaming console with dual-cartridge slots - a direct shot at Nintendo's classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan.\nDuan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished - a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally \"rising higher step-by-step\". BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment became one of the country's biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola.\nIt was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out duelling marketing campaigns in markets from India to South-East Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said.\n\"The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan,\" said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience.\n\"Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation.\"\nGreatest success\nDuan's latest endeavours were, in part, dreamed up in Apple's backyard.\nBy 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement.\nBy the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled.\n\"We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully - in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don't lose money,\" he said.\nThose intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan's greatest success.\nIn 2005, the entrepreneur and his protege Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan's disciples, Shen Wei.\n\"Making mobile phones was not my call,\" said Duan. \"But I reckoned we could do well in this market.\"\nAffordable image, high-end specs\nAt first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market.\nBut Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers' store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs.\nOn the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life.\nIt paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies's 76.6 million units, Apple's 44.9 million and Xiaomi's 41.5 million, IDC estimates.\nOppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively - Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst.\nDuan's smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo's shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence.\n\"Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there's no replacement. But we don't know,\" Duan said.\nFierce competition\nCook said on the weekend that Apple doesn't have a specific goal for market share.\n\"The competition is more fierce in China - not only in this industry, but in many industries,\" Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. \"I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.\"\nDuan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won't say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid \"disturbing them\".\nHis rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using \"imbalanced information\" to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot.\n\"Those who said this were insane,\" Duan said without naming names. \"When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.\"\nSavvy financier\nHis most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $US620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan's blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple.\nDuan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease founder William Ding, out of a hole.\nDing's internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first US-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue.\nDuan came to his friend's aid, buying about 5 per cent of Netease with just $US2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $US40.\nHis other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan.\nDuan isn't shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016.\n'I'll never make a comeback'\nBut looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm's length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders.\nAnd while BBK's Vivo and Duan's own Oppo have done well, there's no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona's Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signalling a new maturity.\nOne thing's for sure, Duan doesn't see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge.\n\"I've made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,\" he said. \"If there's a problem they can't fix, then neither can I.\"\nBloomberg\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-19T23:58:18Z", "images": []}

Those were supplied by the computer hobbyists who bought the boards direct from the embryonic Apple or from the Byte Shop, an early computer store in Mountain View, Calif.\nIn 1976, the first Apple-1 personal computers were sold for $666.66, or approximately $2,830 in today's dollars. They remain rare, with about 60 of the original 200 known to exist, several in the hands of museums such as the Smithsonian Museum of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Henry Ford Museum of Innovation in Dearborn, Mich.\nBreker's estimate was lower than recent sales prices of other Apple-1 computers. Interest in the machine has surged since 2010 as Apple itself blew through one revenue record after another, and as co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011, marking to some the passing of an era in personal computing.\nAuction prices jumped from $242,000 in 2010 to $671,000 in 2013, then topped out at the $905,000 paid by The Henry Ford Museum in October 2014.\nThe lower projection by Breker may be because the auction house believed interest has waned or perhaps because of minor modifications to the circuit board. Mike Willegal, an engineer with a major technology company whose hobbies include tracking Apple-1 computers, noted that the system had an extra capacitor and additional logic on the board.\n[ Get certified as an Apple Technical Coordinator with this seven-part online course from PluralSight. ]\nBreker's Apple-1 is in working order, the auctioneer asserted, and backed up the claim with video of the computer loading several short demonstration programs from a cassette and running them.

{"title": "Apple's next big thing: augmented reality", "content": "Larger text size\nVery large text size\nTim Cook has talked up a lot of technologies since becoming Apple's chief executive in 2011. Driverless cars. Artificial intelligence. Streaming television. But no technology has fired up Cook quite like augmented reality, which overlays images, video and games on the real world. Cook has likened AR's game-changing potential to that of the smartphone. At some point, he said last year, we will all \"have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.\"\nInvestors impatient for Apple's next breakthrough will be happy to know that Cook is very serious about AR. People with knowledge of the company's plans say Apple has embarked on an ambitious bid to bring the technology to the masses-an effort Cook and his team see as the best way for the company to dominate the next generation of gadgetry and keep people wedded to its ecosystem.\nApple CEO Tim Cook is betting on augmented reality.\nCredit:Bloomberg\nApple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software.\nAs previously reported, Apple is working on several AR products, including digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content-movies, maps and more-to the wearer. While the glasses are a ways off, AR features could show up in the iPhone sooner.\nApple declined to comment.\nAdvertisement\nWill Apple be able to avoid the issues that sunk Google Glass?\nIt's an auspicious moment for Apple to move into augmented reality. The global market for AR products will surge 80 per cent to US$165 billion by 2024, according to researcher Global Market Insights. But Apple really has no choice, says Gene Munster, a founding partner at Loup Ventures who covered the company for many years as an analyst. Over time, Munster says, AR devices will replace the iPhone. \"It's something they need to do to continue to grow,\" he says, \"and defend against the shift in how people use hardware.\"\nAugmented reality is the less known cousin of virtual reality. VR gets more attention because it completely immerses users in an artificial world and has an obvious attraction for gamers. So far, however, headsets like the Oculus and HoloLens are niche rather than mainstream products. Apple believes AR will be an easier sell because it's less intrusive. Referring to VR headsets, Cook last year said he thought few people will want to be \"enclosed in something.\"\nBuilding a successful AR product will be no easy task, even for a company known for slim, sturdy devices. The current crop of AR glasses are either under-powered and flimsy or powerful and overwhelmingly large. Apple, the king of thin and light, will have to leapfrog current products by launching something small and powerful.\nAdding AR features to the iPhone isn't a giant leap. Building glasses will be harder. Like the Watch, they'll probably be tethered to the iPhone. While the smartphone will do the heavy lifting, beaming 3D content to the glasses will consume a lot of power, so prolonging battery life will be crucial. Content is key too. If Apple's AR glasses lack useful apps, immersive games and interesting media content, why would someone wear them? The glasses will also require a new operating system and perhaps even a new chip. Finally, Apple will have to source the guts of the gadget cheaply enough to make it affordable for the mass market.\nWhen it was developing the Watch, Apple put together a multi-disciplinary team drawn from inside and outside the company. It has done much the same with the AR effort. In 2015, Apple recruited Mike Rockwell, who previously ran the hardware and new technologies groups at Dolby, the iconic company known for its audio and video technology. Rockwell also advised Meta, a small firm that makes $950 AR glasses and counts Dolby as an investor.\nRockwell now runs the main AR team at Apple, reporting to Dan Riccio, who's in charge of the iPhone and iPad hardware engineering groups, the people said. \"He's a really sharp guy,\" says Jack McCauley, who co-founded and worked at Oculus before it was sold to Facebook in 2015. \"He could certainly put a team together that could get an Apple AR project going.\"\nLast spring, in a sign that it's serious about taking products to market, Apple put some of its best hardware and software people on Rockwell's team, including Fletcher Rothkopf who helped lead the team that designed the Apple Watch, and Tomlinson Holman, who created THX, the audio standard made popular by LucasFilm.\nApple has also recruited people with expertise in everything from 3D video production to wearable hardware. Among them, the people say: Cody White, former lead engineer of Amazon's Lumberyard virtual reality platform; Duncan McRoberts, Meta's former director of software development; Yury Petrov, a former Oculus researcher; and Avi Bar-Zeev, who worked on the HoloLens and Google Earth.\nApple has rounded out the team with iPhone, camera and optical lens engineers. There are people with experience in sourcing the raw materials for the glasses. The company has also mined the movie industry's 3D animation ranks, the people said, opening a Wellington office and luring several employees from Weta Digital, the New Zealand special-effects shop that worked on King Kong, Avatar and other films.\nBesides hiring people, Apple has been busy making tactical acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Metaio, which developed AR software. Former Metaio CEO Thomas Alt now works on Apple's strategic deals team, which decides which technologies to invest in. Last year, Apple also bought FlyBy Media, which makes AR-related camera software. Cook even visited the offices of Magic Leap last summer and displayed interest in the secretive company's AR technology, the people say. Magic Leap declined to comment.\nHundreds of engineers are now devoted to the cause, including some on the iPhone camera team who are working on AR-related features for the iPhone, according to one of the people. One of the features Apple is exploring is the ability to take a picture and then change the depth of the photograph or the depth of specific objects in the picture later; another would isolate an object in the image, such as a person's head, and allow it to be tilted 180 degrees. A different feature in development would use augmented reality to place virtual effects and objects on a person, much the way Snapchat works. The iPhone camera features would probably rely on a technology known as depth sensing and use algorithms created by PrimeSense, an Israeli company acquired in 2013. Apple may choose to not roll out these features, but such additions are an up-and-coming trend in the phone business.\nThe AR-enhanced glasses are further down the road, the people say. Getting the product right will be key, of course. Wearables are hard. Apple's first stab at the category, the Watch, has failed to become a mainstream hit. And no one has forgotten Google Glass, the much-derided headset that bombed in 2014. Still, time and again, Apple has waited for others to go first and then gone on to dominate the market. \"To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments,\" Munster says. \"Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off.\"\nWith Alex Webb, Mark Bergen\nBloomberg\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-20T21:04:15Z", "images": []}

For example, many malware researchers execute malicious code or visit compromise websites inside virtual machines to observe their behavior and contain their impact.\nOne of the main goals of hypervisors like VMware Workstation is to create a barrier between the guest operating system that runs inside the virtual machine and the host OS where the hypervisor runs. That's why VM escape exploits are highly prized, more so than browser or OS exploits.\nRELATED: The paranoid user\u2019s guide to Windows 10 privacy\nThis year, the organizers of Pwn2Own, an annual hacking contest that runs during the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver, Canada, offered a prize of US$100,000 for breaking the isolation layer enforced by the VMware Workstation or Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisors.\nFriday, on the third and final day of the contest, two teams stepped up to the challenge ; both of them from China.\nTeam Sniper, made up of researchers from the Keen Lab and PC Manager divisions of internet services provider Tencent, chained together three vulnerabilities to escape from the guest OS running inside VMware Workstation to the host OS.\nThe other team, from the security arm of Qihoo 360, achieved an even more impressive attack chain that started with a compromise of Microsoft Edge, moved to the Windows kernel, and then escaped from the VMware Workstation virtual machine. They were awarded $105,000 for their feat.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-20T17:08:00Z", "images": []}

Some slowing of credit growth appears likely. We don't expect macro-prudential measures to impact REITs sentiment as much as in 2015.\nCould a \"policy error\" lead to a crack in the housing market? Possibly, but this is not our base case and housing is likely to remain solid while rates are low and the global economy recovers.

Or New Zealand, for that matter.\nAnyway, Chinese houses are pricey and the poor affordability for the country's homebuyers \"doesn't necessarily mean that housing prices will drop sharply anytime soon,\" the BAML analysts write.\n\"Japan's and Ireland's had reached far higher levels before theirs corrected while Australia's, Korea's, and indeed, China's have stayed at high levels for years without any major price correction so far.\"\n\"However, a few factors could make housing price in China over the next few years more vulnerable than most, including financial system risk posed by a rapid rise of leverage economy-wide, and a lack of exchange rate flexibility.\"\nInterestingly, the broker believes that \"high asset prices, including housing prices, is one of the main drivers of capital outflow\" from China.\n\"The local rich may prefer NY condos to Shanghai apartments for better value, for example,\" they write. (Or, we'd suggest, Sydney or Melbourne apartments.)\n\"From this perspective, for the outflow pressure to ease, either housing prices in renminbi terms have to decline or RMB devalues.\n\"If it comes down to it, we expect the government to choose RMB devaluation over asset price deflation. Arguably the biggest driver behind high asset prices in China is leverage in our opinion. As a result, any major asset price decline may quickly trigger a debt deflation spiral and financial system instability, by our assessment.\"\nWhich wouldn't be great for Australia, either.

But Bengalla has been strategically important to New Hope, which has found it difficult to win government approvals for an expansion of its Acland mine in Queensland's Darling Downs.\nAcland and the smaller Jeebropilly mines in Queensland delivered $17.9 million profit after tax to New Hope in the six months ended January 31, while Bengalla delivered $39.7 million. Bengalla's bigger contribution was achieved despite the fact more tonnes of coal were mined at Acland.\nThe miner's $54.8 million underlying profit was a big improvement on the $15 million profit reported for the comparable period of last year, and was slightly better than New Hope had told the market to expect. The company's final profit was improved further at $68.3 million, after a Queensland Competition Authority ruling saw New Hope win a $13.9 million after tax refund on rail tariffs paid since 2013.\nThe result could have been stronger had New Hope's export facility in Brisbane not been temporarily closed shortly before Christmas. Shareholders will receive a fully franked interim dividend of 4\u00a2, which is double the dividend paid for the first half of last year.\nThe miner currently has an opportunity grow the size of its stake in Bengalla, with Wesfarmers selling its 40 per cent stake in the mine.\nNew Hope is expected to bid for the mine, and said on Tuesday it would try to \"secure further cost efficiencies at the mine\".\nMacquarie said securing Queensland Government approvals for Acland would be a major catalyst for New Hope shares, but the Macquarie analysts said their $2.10 price target for the stock did not include a full approval for Acland.\nNew Hope shares are up 5.4 per cent at $1.84.\nNew Hope is still trying to expand its New Acland mine in Queensland.\nCredit:Bloomberg\nMore\n12.47pm on Mar 21, 2017\nHere are the early responses to this morning's RBA board minutes, and first cab off the rank is CBA economist Gareth Aird who says the minutes is \"yet further evidence that the RBA is firmly on hold\":\nIn our view, it would take a sustained loss of momentum in job creation or a fall in dwelling prices for Lowe to entertain the idea of taking the policy rate lower. Neither outcome is in our central scenario and as such, we see the RBA on hold over 2017 and well into 2018.\nRBC Capital's Su-Ling Ong also said the minutes \"confirmed a central bank on hold\", she detects \"a couple of noteworthy additions which erred on the hawkish side\":\nFirstly, the discussion around global growth and the outlook was positive, with the RBA noting a number of improved data points. More significant the discussion in today's minutes hints at some upside to their terms of trade forecast.\nSecondly, the language around the housing market conveyed a sense of increased concern over the medium-term risks emerging from rising prices, increasing supply, and weak rental returns.\nOur sense is that there is building pressure for additional macro prudential action. Coupled with recent measures, history would suggest that they are effective, with borrowing responding within four to five months, as was the experience in 2015. Together with a likely peak in dwelling construction in late Q3, the housing market may well look quite different by late 2017, giving the RBA greater optionality should the wage and inflation picture remain largely unchanged.\nCut to Capital Economics and Paul Dales, who reckons \"there are some signs that the RBA is starting to wonder if inflation pressures are more subdued than it thought\":\nThe RBA appears more guarded on the outlook for wage growth, and consequently, inflation. In the minutes of February's meeting, the RBA noted that \"there were some indications that wage growth has reached a trough\". But by March it said \"there was very little labour cost pressure in the economy\". And the surprise rise in the unemployment rate to 5.9% in February (which was released after March's meeting), will only have heightened the RBA's labour market worries.\nIn other words, there are some signs that the RBA is starting to wonder if inflation pressures are more subdued than it thought. This is one of the conditions that would be necessary to trigger further rate cuts. The other is an easing of its financial stability concerns. The strong housing market shows that's not happening yet, but the recent rises in mortgage rates and talk of tighter constraints on lending suggests that housing will end the year weaker than it started it.\nMore\n12.17pm on Mar 21, 2017\nDowner EDI spent more than 12 months plotting its $1.2 billion takeover bid for Spotless and believes the services group is financially \"sound,\" chief executive Grant Fenn said after launching a $1 billion equity raising.\nDowner confirmed it would offer $1.15 per Spotless share to acquire the group after securing a 19.99 per cent stake on Monday afternoon. It will pay for the proposed takeover with proceeds from the equity raising and debt.\nSpotless shares have surged 46 per cent today to $1.06, so still shy of the offer price, accounting for some risk the deal doesn't go ahead. Downer shares are in a trading halt as it raises equity.\nAnalysts have raised questions over whether Downer had any concerns over the financial strength of Spotless, given the services group delivered poor first-half results and revealed $423 million in writedowns.\nMr Fenn said Downer had \"looked carefully\" over the company's public financial statements over the past few years.\n\"We are comfortable mounting this offer with the information that we have,\" he said, adding the services group appeared to have \"made an effort\" to address its issues over the past few years and that it would be a \"good fit\" with Downer.\n\"Fundamentally, we think the [Spotless] platform is sound...we're very confident that we can run this business well.\"\nSpotless said on Tuesday that Downer's offer was \"highly conditional\" and that shareholders should take no action.\n\"The board will evaluate the offer and Downer's bidder's statement and provide shareholders with a recommendation in due course,\" Spotless said.\nDowner's takeover offer does not require the contractor to be given due diligence access, but is conditional on no further Spotless profit downgrades or \"significant events\".\nSpotless chairman Garry Hounsell said that the board believed in \"the fundamental strengths\" of the company's business, including its blue-chip customer base and a strong portfolio of long term contracts.\nThe takeover proposal forms part of Downer's long-term strategy to build a stronger services business and diversify away from mining, allowing it to bid for more government contracts, particularly defence, as well as health and education contracts.\nDowner's management team [CEO Grant Fenn and chairman Mike Harding] have been eyeing Spotless for more than a year.\nCredit:Louise Kennerley\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-21T05:46:58Z", "images": []}

As part of the internal investigation of our own products and the publicly available information, Cisco security researchers found a vulnerability in the Cluster Management Protocol code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges.\nIn terms of mitigations to consider, disabling the Telnet protocol as an allowed protocol for incoming connections would eliminate the exploit vector.

Terms of use .\nApple doesn\u2019t move iPads like it used to, but that\u2019s true of all tablets. The Cupertino company has been hard at work trying to come up with reasons for people to upgrade. Make it bigger? Offer a stylus? Now Apple is just trying a lower price. The new iPad (it\u2019s just \u201ciPad\u201d) was announced Tuesday without an event . Apple likes its events, but I can see why they\u2019d skip it this time. The new iPad is almost an admission that tablets simply can\u2019t cost $500-600.\nThis is not technically an entirely new piece of hardware. Most of what makes up the new iPad is actually an iPad Air 2. It still has a 9.7-inch display, but it\u2019s been upgraded to a newer-generation Retina Display. It\u2019s supposed to be brighter with more accurate colors. Meanwhile, the Apple A8X chip from the original Air 2 has been ditched in favor of the Apple A9. That\u2019s the processor used in the iPhone 6s. So, not the latest and greatest, but still a step up.\nIt does make sense for Apple to make some changes to the iPad lineup, and the price is the easiest thing to change. The revamped iPad is $70 less than the iPad Air 2 was, and this undercuts many of the tablets that have been competing with Apple\u2019s cheaper 9.7-inch device. The company says this is the size most favored by consumers.\nApple was very careful not to make the new iPad too good. It\u2019s still clearly the entry-level model. This tablet lacks support for the Apple Pencil and the Smart keyboard Dock. Those are both reserved for the top-of-the-line iPad Pro, which comes in 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch sizes. The regular smart covers will work, though. Buyers of the new iPad will also have to make do with the bottom-firing stereo speakers. The Pro models have quad speakers.\nOf course, you make those trade-offs for the price. Apple is only asking $329 for the base 32GB model of the new iPad. It\u2019s $459 if you want to add LTE support to that. It comes in gold, silver, and space gray colors. So, you also miss out on that rose gold option. \u00a0You\u2019ll be able to pick up the new iPad on March 24th. The iPad Pro and iPad Mini continue to exist, but the Mini is also gaining a new 128GB storage option. Still, if you want a\u00a0full-sized iPad, the newly revamped one is your cheapest option.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-21T18:17:58Z", "images": []}

In essence, these are smarter access points that are better able to handle large numbers of users at any given time, and feature more advanced ways to manage different kinds of wireless links.\nThere still aren\u2019t a lot of endpoints out there that use wave 2 \u2013 most laptops and smartphones, even near the top of the market, still ship with first-wave 802.11ac technology \u2013 but some businesses are opting to catch the second wave in the interest of future-proofing, addressing densification and more. Wave 2 endpoints aren\u2019t needed to take advantage of some of the advantages provided by MU-MIMO.\n+ ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: Study shows 802.11ac wave 2 APs gaining sales ground +\nDr. John Layke, DO, is a plastic surgeon and a partner in the Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery Group, which also sells Layke and partner Dr. Payman Danielpour\u2019s line of Beverly Hills MD cosmetics. In their small southern California office, their group uses four 802.11ac wave 2 access points from Linksys for both Wi-Fi connectivity and a couple of specialized services.\nThe practice uses a 3D imaging system to scan detailed pictures of all its patients, and an advanced Wi-Fi system is important for moving those files around the office to various places at top speed \u2013 wave 2 is capable of nearly 7Gbps of theoretical throughput, though, obviously, practical speeds will be much lower.\n\u201cOnce [the 3D pictures] are uploaded, we can discuss and alter the image and even display it on the computers back in the operating room to ensure that we\u2019re giving them the result that we discussed,\u201d Layke told Network World.\nIt\u2019s a change from the group\u2019s previous wireless infrastructure, which couldn\u2019t even stream music from the front desk into a spa area, according to Layke.\n\u201cThe ability now is far superior to what we had,\u201d he said.\nLearning to wave 2\nThe St. Vrain Valley School District serves nine high schools, nine middle schools and 23 elementary schools just north of Boulder, Colo., mostly in the suburb of Longmont. That\u2019s about 32,000 students, each of whom has their own iPad issued by the school, to say nothing of the individual devices they bring in.\n\u201cWe saw our sites needing that density with the ac 2 and going to 5GHz only, just because of our client density and our iPads,\u201d said district CTO Joe McBreen. The transition to 5GHz \u2013 which does not propagate as far as 2.4GHz \u2013 means that it\u2019s easier for access points to avoid interfering with each other, opening up more channels for potential use.\nThe district landed on Cisco gear, after a competitive bidding process, replacing older Ruckus equipment in St. Vrain\u2019s 41 schools. They\u2019re up to 360 wave 2 access points currently, a number that will grow to 2,000 or so by the time the project is complete.\nAside from some early software hiccups that Cisco fixed, the transition has been going really well, according to McBreen and network engineer Greg Martien.\n\u201cWe have some challenges right now \u2013 we use Bonjour and AirPlay, just like every other user out there using those types of services with Apple, trying to departmentalize that by site, but other than that, it\u2019s working,\u201d Martien said.\nSt. Vrain is also a Google Apps for Education customer, and sees a lot of students and staff using video Hangouts, which can be a bandwidth hog. In the future, multiplayer VR simulations and further growth in video-based lessons could continue to raise throughput demands.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-15T17:24:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "What happened to tablet sales?", "content": "Brian Heater @bheater / 2 years\nIn the past month, both Apple and Samsung have refreshed their flagship tablets for the first time since 2014. A lot has changed in the space in the intervening years \u2014 mostly for the worse, as overall sales have continued to slip. In Q4 of last year, IDC reported that shipments had dropped 20 percent, year over year, while Strategic Analytics has the number at half that.\nThere\u2019s room for debate as far as precisely how down the overall market is (not to mention what precisely qualifies a device as a tablet), but there seems to at least be a consensus that early predictions of the tablet space eclipsing PCs missed the mark. The space has suffered for a variety of reasons. Among them, the fact that users simply aren\u2019t refreshing tablets at a rate many manufacturers no doubt predicted.\n\u201cThe iPad 2 is still in use today,\u201d IDC Senior Analyst Jitesh Ubrani tells TechCrunch. \u201cThe [original] iPad Minis and Air are all still in use today. They were being supported by Apple until very recently. People have been hanging onto these devices and they\u2019re finding that they work just as well as they did when they were released.\u201d\nThere are a few reasons for this. For one thing, users haven\u2019t been conditioned to upgrade slates on the same cycle as smartphone \u2014 something that\u2019s been hammered into consumers in almost Pavlovian fashion through carrier upgrade cycles.\nThere\u2019s also the simple fact that we tend not to put the devices through the same sort of day to day wear and tear of smartphones, or even laptops, with many users simply leaving their devices at home and breaking them out when it\u2019s time to watch some Netflix.\nStrategy Analytics senior analyst Eric Smith points to a disappointing upgrade cycle as a contributing factor to the lack of excitement surrounding tablets, singling out today\u2019s iPad refresh as a case in point. \u201cAbsent any big innovations like a flexible screen or 4K panels,\u201d he tells TechCrunch, \u201cyou\u2019re really not going to be able to induce replacement the way that they have been over the last few years.\u201d\nThe growing size of smartphone displays has gone a ways toward cannibalizing tablet sales, as well, limiting the need for a much larger device when so many handsets are now within the six-inch range. On the high end of the spectrum, convertible touchscreen Windows 10 devices have eaten into tablet market share, while Chromebook sales have begun to dominate the education market that tablet makers once saw as a key use case.\nMikako Kitagawa of Gartner also suggests that part of the slow down in sales can be chalked up to user disappointment in the devices\u2019 limitation following the initial excitement around the space. \u201cWhen users started using the tablets, they realized that the devices had limitations versus a PC,\u201d she tells TechCrunch. \u201cThere\u2019s also a limitation for the device on the go. They\u2019re too bulky to bring anywhere.\u201d\nSo, as some users have opted out of the regular upgrade cycle, plenty more are simply content with two devices, instead of three. And as phones get bigger and PCs become more tablet-like, the gap between them only continues to shrink.\nToday\u2019s price drop could well signal Apple\u2019s response to a contracting market, as the company tries to further incentivize refreshes, push hesitant purchasers over the edge and convince iPad owners that maybe the time is right to become a two tablet household. After all, the drop follows a significant price cut from the company\u2019s iPad Pro line back in September.\nAnd it could well prove a bellwether for premium tablets across the industry. After all, Samsung announced last week that it would be pricing the Tab S3 at $599. Don\u2019t be too surprised to see the company slash it to something more competitive in the wake of this week\u2019s iPad announcement.\nIt\u2019s all part of what could be an industry-wide race to the middle, as premium devices drop in price and many makers of cheaper slates simply decide the margins are no longer worth it. After all, Amazon marks a rare bright spot on that end of the spectrum, due to its relatively unique ability to subsidize costs as it positions Fire tablets as, essentially, content delivery devices. Though Kitagawa does suggest that the low end may get a bit of a reprieve as children\u2019s tablets get a bit of a bump.\nWhatever the case, the consensus at present seems to be that tablet sales are likely to continue to erode for the foreseeable future. The introduction of new devices from the category\u2019s two biggest sellers may stem the bleeding a bit for the quarter, but most seem to believe we\u2019re not out of the woods yet.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that companies have shifted focus back to smartphones and other categories. Samsung\u2019s Tab S3 announcement felt more like stop-gap as the company planned its big new phone launch, devoting the end of the event to the announcement of its announcement. Today\u2019s iPad launch this morning, meanwhile, took the form of new release, rather than a big, keynote-style unveiling.\nThe tablet space isn\u2019t doomed, of course. Companies are still shipping tens of millions of units a quarter. But until the next revolution comes along, it\u2019s time to temper those expectations.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-21T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

A new report citing unnamed sources close to the matter claim that Samsung will launch a payment verification feature using facial recognition.\nBloomberg \u2018s\u00a0sources shared that Samsung\u00a0\u201cwill employ facial-recognition technology for mobile payments within months of release\u2026\u201d instead of having the feature ready when the device launches in April . Although Samsung has included facial and voice recognition since the Galaxy S4 , this would be a first for\u00a0implementing these features to authenticate financial transactions.\nThe sources mentioned that this new feature will blend the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, iris and facial recognition to authenticate various mobile services including Samsung Pay. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if this alleged feature and its implementation will truly be something that can set the Galaxy S8 family apart from LG\u2019s G6 ,\u00a0Apple\u2019s upcoming 10th-anniversary release , and the rest of the competition .\nHopefully, we\u2019ll see fast and accurate enough iris and facial recognition that it could relieve the need to use the fingerprint sensor. This would come in handy especially in the case of mobile payments, as tapping a fingerprint sensor so close to the top of the phone could be an annoyance since we generally tap the top of the phone to the terminal.\nIn a recent poll , almost 80% of respondents shared they don\u2019t like Samsung\u2019s decision to place the fingerprint sensor on the rear near the camera sensor. Although Samsung devoted a lot of resources to bringing an on-screen fingerprint sensor \u00a0to this year\u2019s flagship devices, the third-party partner they were working with wasn\u2019t able to make it happen in time.\nIt isn\u2019t too surprising that Samsung is working hard to bring more innovation to the Galaxy S8, even if it launches after the smartphones are first available. The iPhone is expected to bring an on-screen fingerprint reader along and\u00a0 facial recognition \u00a0and some analysts think Samsung is in the toughest position its ever been in, as far as the smartphone market.\nWe\u2019ll find out if Samsung has any surprises left when they officially announce the Galaxy S8 and S8+ on March 29th .

That could be happening sooner than you think.\nStarting next year, ARM processors will get significantly faster thanks to big changes in the company\u2019s Cortex-A chip designs. ARM is taking a page from rivals like AMD that have focused on raising the performance threshold in chips.\nARM isn\u2019t known for superfast chips; it is instead mainly associated with power-efficient chips that give long battery life to devices. That focus has helped the company succeed in mobile devices, an area where Intel\u2019s power hungry chips failed.\n[ Further reading: The best CPUs for gaming ]\nBut applications like virtual reality and machine learning need more performance, and ARM is preparing its processors to take on those emerging applications. ARM is adding more cores, instructions, and faster pipelines in smaller spaces to boost performance.\nThe new features are packaged under the term \u201cDynamIQ\u201d and will be in upcoming Cortex chips for mobile, PC, server, and internet-of-things devices.\nPerformance metrics will come when ARM announces the first chip designs with DynamIQ features, which could happen early next year, said John Ronco, vice president of product marketing.\nDynamIQ adds more performance without compromising ARM\u2019s power efficiency focus, Ronco said. Most devices from ARM don\u2019t require cooling fans, and that will remain the case with DynamIQ features in chip designs.\nThe improvements increase the possibility of Apple switching over to ARM architecture on its Macs. That hasn\u2019t happened yet as Intel\u2019s mainstream Core chips are significantly faster than current ARM processors. Like other chipmakers, Apple licenses ARM architecture, which it already uses in iPhones, iPads, and other devices.\nIt\u2019s becoming a trend for chipmakers to pile on more performance in chips, especially with the emergence of gaming and virtual reality. Intel is committed to delivering a minimum of 15 percent more performance with every new chip generation, and AMD said its new Ryzen chips delivered 40 percent more instructions per cycle (IPC), an important performance metric.\nArchitectures get modified with market demands of the time, and the chip industry is seeing the emergence of machine learning as a primary workload, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research.\nThough ARM is a RISC design, it is getting new extensions and evolving much like x86,\u00a0making the two hard to differentiate, McCarron said.\nARM previously added vector extensions to its new ARMv8-A SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) design for high-performance computing. The company has also added extensions for virtualization and other features.\nThe new DynamIQ features will be in the existing ARMv8-A architecture. Cortex designs will be able to pack up to eight cores in a single cluster, compared to four cores in existing designs. The cores will share memory, throughput, and other core components.\nA chip could have different types of cores, for example, an eight-core chip with four fast CPUs for demanding applications and four slower CPUs for low-power, fast-moving tasks. That is already a part of ARM\u2019s\u00a0\u201cBig.Little\u201d design but is being enhanced with DynamIQ.\nMediaTek\u2019s X30 chip already has 10 CPU cores concentrated in three packages. In theory, DynamIQ will allow Cortex-based chips to pack 16 cores in two clusters, making better use of limited smartphone space.\nAlso in the DynamIQ\u00a0are new instructions for machine learning, and CPUs will deliver 50 times more artificial intelligence performance in the next three to five years, ARM claimed.\nAt the heart of these improvements are the ability for CPUs to do more low-level and power-efficient processing of machine-learning tasks. All of the calculations can be combined to provide an estimated answer to a question. The improvements include more half-precision floating point operations, which are common in machine-learning-focused chips like Intel\u2019s upcoming Knights Mill, and AI GPUs from AMD and Nvidia.\nA big performance boost will also come from faster pipelines, but there is no fundamental change in the core pipeline design or branch prediction. Radical changes there are more of a long-term project, Ronco said.\nARM has older processors like the Cortex-A8, which is more than a decade old and recently used in the BeagleBone Blue robotics developer board. It won\u2019t be possible to mix those CPU architectures into the new DynamIQ design.\nTo comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-21T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Shut up, the footy's on the internet (with apologies to TISM)", "content": "The post-AFL grand final presentations last year out-rated the game for broadcaster Seven.\nCredit:Joe Armao\nFoxtel in your lounge room\nThe only way to ensure that you can watch every match, every round, is to sign up with Foxtel or Telstra. At this point it gets complicated, depending on which screen you're watching.\nAs usual a full home Foxtel subscription lets you watch every AFL and NRL match live, but you're still forced to contend with the dreaded bundle; you need to pay for a basic Foxtel package before you can sign up for the premium Sports package. Right now Foxtel is offering a $55 p/m Sports package deal with no lock-in contract, but existing customers might not get such a good deal.\nFoxtel on your gadgets\nIf you've got a home Foxtel subscription then you can watch the channels in your bundle via the Foxtel Go streaming service , which is available on computers, smartphones and tablets. In the past you haven't been able to watch live AFL via Foxtel Go in a desktop app, but that's changed with this year's new rights deal.\nFoxtel still tries to hamper efforts to watch the live streaming footy on your television. The apps don't work with Google Chromecast or Apple's AirPlay, but you can still plug your computer into your television if you have the right video cable. Keep in mind that it's only an SD stream, so don't expect miracles on a large television.\nFoxtel Play\nRather than paying for a home Foxtel subscription, there's also the option of signing up for Foxtel Play which is available on smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, Smart TVs, games consoles and the Telstra TV set-top box. While Foxtel Play has simplified its pricing this year you still need to sign up for a $10 or $15 basic package before you can sign up for the $29 premium Sports package.\nIn the past one AFL match was missing on Foxtel Play each round, for no other reason than to frustrate you to the point where you'll cave in and pay for real Foxtel. Thankfully that's changed as of this year and you'll see every AFL match live, except for the Grand Final (just to make life difficult).\nUnder the new rights deal Foxtel is also more generous regarding playback devices. This season you'll finally be able to watch live AFL and NRL on Foxtel Go or Play via a desktop app, Smart TVs and game consoles apps. It's also available via the Telstra TV set-top box which \u2013 unlike the others \u2013 offers HD sports streaming.\nTelstra on your gadgets\nThese days online mobile rights are treated as a separate deal, with Telstra snapping up the rights for both the AFL and NRL and throwing it in for free on some phone deals with unmetered streaming. Don't get too excited about watching these services on the big screen, they insist that you squint at your smartphone or tablet.\nThe new rights deals aren't all good news for footy fans, this year tablet users signed up with the Telstra sevice can only watch live AFL matches in a 7-inch window on the screen \u2013 it's not available to watch in full-screen mode until 12 hours after the match. As you can imagine this has made a lot of people rather unhappy.\nYou can't watch live matches on the Telstra TV set-top box using a Telstra sports subscription, only match replays and highlights. Nor do the Telstra mobile apps support AirPlay or Chromecast for sending the picture to your television, and you might struggle to send the picture to your television via an HDMI adaptor cable.\nThankfully you're not forced to sign up for the entire season just to watch a few matches, NRL fans have the option to just pay for a single round while AFL fans can pay for a single round or a single month.\nAustralian ex-pats get a better deal when it comes to watching on different devices. The AFL's overseas streaming service offers every match via a desktop browser, iOS or Android (with AirPlay and Chromecast support). It's available with a weekly, monthly or season pass, but unfortunately geo-blocking ensures that it's only available to people located outside Australia.\nAre you excited that the footy's back? How will you watch your team play this season?\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-23T01:32:36Z", "images": []}

To learn how to do it, he went to the only place he knew that had books and magazines about computers: The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. He went on a Sunday and walked right in. \"The smartest people in the world don't lock doors,\" Wozniak said.\n[ Beware the 9 warning signs of bad IT architecture and see why these 10 old-school IT principles still rule . | Sign up for CIO newsletters . ]\nA similar philosophy led him to give away his design for what later became the Apple 1. After drawing up plans that would let people build their own computer for US$300, he handed them out at the Homebrew Computer Club, an early gathering place for tinkerers who helped launched the PC revolution. He didn't even include copyright notices. \"My motivation wasn't to start a company, wasn't to make money, it was actually just to show off my engineering excellence,\" he said. It was a non-engineer friend, Steve Jobs, who persuaded him to monetize both phreaking and the personal computer.\nOn resourcefulness\nWozniak always sought to build things with not only the fewest parts but also the cheapest ones. After learning about phreaking, he set out to build a machine for it in his dorm room. \"I bought a sack of diodes at Radio Shack that weren't guaranteed. And about half of them were bad, but I didn't know which half. ... When a tone didn't work on my box, I would go to this guy who had perfect pitch. He was a musician in the next room over.\"\nOn myths and movies:\nThe early days of Apple are the stuff of legend and pop culture now, but not all the stories are true, according to Wozniak. One is a scene in the Ashton Kutcher film \"Jobs\" in which Jobs pushes Bob Dylan on a Beatles-loving Wozniak. When they met, Jobs was 16 and had no music albums at home, Wozniak said. \"I\"m the one who introduced Steve Jobs to all this Bob Dylan stuff.\" The two ended up going to many concerts and collecting bootleg recordings and analyses of Dylan's lyrics.\nOn robotics:\nIf he were young today, Wozniak would go into robotics. He wants to design a robot that could go into a house it doesn't know, find the kitchen on its own, and figure out how to make coffee.\nHe's not too worried about the machines taking over.\n\"It's getting scary the direction it's heading, but it'll take a long, long time before there's something like a master race over humans. They'll need us,\" Wozniak said.\nOn education:\nWozniak, who has worked as a grade-school teacher, said motivation is more important than knowledge from books or teachers. \"If you want to learn something, you'll get there,\" he said. It's good for children to learn programming, but they should wait until age 12 for their brains to mature, he said.\nOn his dream job:\nBefore he and Jobs founded Apple, Wozniak offered his PC designs to Hewlett-Packard, where he worked on the company's legendary calculators. He didn't want to risk that position by starting a new company. The fifth time HP turned him down, he reluctantly left.\nForty years later, in a very different Silicon Valley, the job of Wozniak's dreams is a poignant vision: \"I was going to be an engineer forever at Hewlett-Packard, because you could get old and still be an engineer there. How lucky for me! I would never lose my job at HP.\"\nNext read this:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-22T21:32:00Z", "images": []}

Weak, in Bailey's mind, was not necessarily simply short, but \"one that was in the dictionary.\"\nHackers can brute-force passwords that consist of a single real-world word -- one in the dictionary -- by relying on, not surprisingly, lists of words from the dictionary.\nBailey reiterated the long-standing advice to compose passwords from numbers, letters and special characters, such as & and ^.\nChanging an iCloud account password is straight-forward; Apple spells out password reset on this page .\n\"They should also enable two-factor authentication,\" Bailey continued, referring to the security layer available to those running iOS 9 or later on an iPhone or iPad, or OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) or later.\niCloud/Apple ID two-factor authentication -- iCloud and Apple ID are synonymous for most users -- prevents a hacker from changing credentials unless they have one of the user's designated \"trusted devices,\" typically a smartphone. To access one's iCloud/Apple ID account -- say to change the password -- a person must have not only the password, but also the trusted device, which receives a verification code that also must be entered before the password reset can be processed.\nApple outlines two-factor authentication on this web page .\nThose with iPhones, iPads or Macs that don't meet the operating system requirements for two-factor authentication -- or who don't have any Apple device -- can substitute the similar, yet different two-step authentication. Instructions for enabling and using two-step authentication are available here .\nBecause two-factor authentication isn't a good fit for everyone -- there's a trade-off between security and usability -- Bailey suggested that those who hesitate to enable two-factor should instead change passwords on a frequent basis. Many companies mandate regular password resets, for example. By changing passwords, credentials stolen by criminals can be made obsolete.\n\"An alternative for two-factor is to change passwords fairly often,\" said Bailey, who recommended a password manager -- he used the label password vault that offers automated resets. Both LastPass, which Bailey hesitated to name because of a recent breach of its own, and Dashlane, include features that can reset multiple passwords at a time, although not for every website.\nBailey also urged iCloud account holders to back up their devices, not just to the cloud but to local storage as well. \"You don't want to lose your pictures,\" Bailey said.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-23T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

This would be a very bad security practice and one that serious websites have avoided for many years.\nHowever, it is possible that these passwords were stolen as part of other breaches or cracked from stolen cryptographic hashes and then matched to iCloud accounts due to password reuse practices.

{"title": "What to consider before buying Apple's cheaper iPad and red iPhone", "content": "Play video\nThe strongest selling point for the new 9.7-inch iPad is its price. The tablet now starts at $469, has a retina display and comes in three colours: gold, silver and space gray.\nThe new iPad appears to be a replacement for the iPad Air 2, so it's best to think of it as a successor to that product - an in-between, easy-to-carry tablet for watching video and Web browsing. It is about 20 per cent thicker than its predecessor but is still pretty trim at 469g.\nAdvertisement\nDeciding whether to pay $749 for the new iPhone is almost entirely a cosmetic decision.\nThe lower price tag comes with a few tradeoffs, however. It doesn't have Apple's latest processor but packs the same one from the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, meaning that it is a little slower than the latest iPhone. The new tablet also has no support for the Apple Pencil or Apple's Smart Keyboard - those appear to still be reserved for the iPad Pro line.\nThat will probably be fine for most people. If you're looking for a full laptop replacement, however, it's probably not your best option.\nApple also upped the storage space on the iPad mini to 128 GB, for $579, which could make the smaller tablet more appealing as a travel companion for watching video - if you don't mind the price. The smaller size makes it a little more plane-friendly than a full-size tablet.\nAs for the new red iPhone, deciding whether to pay $1079 for it is almost entirely a cosmetic decision. The anodised red hue is a head-turner and benefits the AIDS awareness campaign Red. Apple has already put a similar colour on its iPods, but this is the first time it has come to the iPhone.\nIf you're really digging the colour or if you are an AIDS research supporter, those are the reasons to buy.

{"title": "Apple has acquired Workflow, a powerful automation tool for iPad and iPhone", "content": "Matthew Panzarino @Panzer / 2 years\nApple has finalized a deal to acquire Workflow today \u2014 a tool that lets you hook together apps and functions within apps in strings of commands to automate tasks. We\u2019ve been tracking this one for a while but were able to confirm just now that the ink on the deal is drying as we speak.\nI haven\u2019t been\u00a0able to get financial details for the deal, but if I come up with them I\u2019ll update. As far as I know it was a solid payday for the team and small upside for investors. Workflow had raised an unannounced seed round of what we\u2019re hearing was in the range of a couple million\u00a0from Lowercase, Eniac and General Catalyst.\nThe app was made by a small team that includes Ari Weinstein, a former iPhone jailbreaker. I\u2019ve been following his efforts since the iPod Linux days and covered his very useful DeskConnect app a few years back.\nWorkflow has been around for a couple of years and we\u2019ve covered it and its updates . It shares some similarity with the service IFTTT, in that it allows people to group together a bunch of actions that can allow them to perform complicated tasks with one tap. It had built up a sizeable number\u00a0of users and downloads over the past few years.\nWorkflow the app is being acquired, along with the team of Weinstein , Conrad Kramer , Ayaka Nonaka and Nick Frey . In a somewhat uncommon move for Apple, the app will continue to be made available on the App Store and will be made free later today.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be joining Apple,\u201d said Weinstein in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can\u2019t wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world.\u201d\nThis is not a \u201cpure acqui-hire\u201d in that Workflow \u2014 not just the talent \u2014 is being purchased in this deal. This makes sense, and I\u2019m glad to see it because Workflow itself was a prime meat example of how to find a need in the iOS ecosystem, tackle it in an interesting way and execute it with cleverness and attention to honoring the platform. Simply put, it\u2019s super smart, really well designed and works very well.\u00a0\nWorkflow won an Apple Design Award in 2015; Apple Accessibility engineer Dean Hudson waxed ecstatic about the way that it handled accessibility. \u201cWhen I first saw the app, I was just like man, this accessibility is cray-cray. This is off the charts!\u201d\nApple confirmed the deal, and has said the following about Workflow:\n\u201cThe Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.\u201d\nThe accessibility features of Workflow are super impressive, especially for an app that is a tool for building complicated macros. It would have been much easier to say hey, this is for heavy users, maybe we don\u2019t need to make sure it\u2019s 100 percent accessible \u2014 but they didn\u2019t, and they won a bunch of awards (and an exit)\u00a0for their trouble.\nWorkflow\u2019s existing integrations with apps are extensive and will continue to be updated. You can see some of the pretty intense capabilities of the app in this post from Federico Viticci , a workflow maniac.\nFor you super nerds, this news could be a nice treat given the recent-ish departure of legend Sal Saghoian , Apple\u2019s automation Czar, and the elimination of his position. Some folks had taken this as a signal that Apple was no longer interested in the automation category.\nThe special sauce of Workflow is that it enables users to dip into specific \u201cdeep linked\u201d functions of individual apps and connect those actions together into a string of seamless, invisible commands. If that sounds familiar, you might be thinking of the budding Siri API \u2014 which will only be getting more beefy as time goes on.\nIf you spool out the thread here it\u2019s not hard to see Workflow being integrated heavily with Siri, allowing even more seamless activation and composition of actions now that the team has access to Apple\u2019s private APIs, which are more robust than the tiny bit of Siri that\u2019s public so far.\nThere are also great opportunities here to offer value-add \u201cpower user\u201d capabilities to the iPad ecosystem. Apple\u2019s efforts to get people to see the iPhone, iPad and even Apple Watch ecosystem as something that can be used for many light-to-medium tasks could be bolstered here.\nThe Workflow app for Apple Watch is especially clever and a nice organic fit \u2014 I\u2019ve long been a proponent of the \u201c 1.5 seconds or bust \u201d interaction model with Apple Watch. Workflow\u2019s \u201cendpoint\u201d is a single tap or automated action that can \u201chide\u201d a complex system of commands or interactions underneath it \u2014 ideal for Apple Watch.\nWorkflow\u2019s acquisition is a fairly crisp example of the kinds of app successes that have become a bit more muddied in this age of services. A small, clever team (that were one-time WWDC student scholarship recipients) built a tool so useful on iOS that Apple itself essentially copped that\u00a0they couldn\u2019t do it better and bought it. It will be interesting to see where it goes from here.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-22T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "WikiLeaks releases new CIA documents describing Mac exploits", "content": "Romain Dillet @romaindillet / 2 years\nWikiLeaks just shared a few new documents as part of the CIA Vault 7 data dump. These documents describe hacking methods allegedly used by the agency to access Apple devices and upload data. Most of today\u2019s exploits are related to the Mac platform. It\u2019s interesting to see the CIA\u2019s old hacking techniques. It\u2019s unclear if some of them still work today.\nUpdate: Apple has provided a statement saying that all these exploits have been fixed for at least a few years already. Here\u2019s the full statement .\nSonic Screwdriver v1.0\nThis 2012 hack is quite neat as it uses a peripheral device to infect your Mac. In particular, the CIA was installing the malware on Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adaptors.\nAfter the CIA had flashed the dongle, it was quite easy to execute. By powering on the Mac, the code would automatically execute on the accessory and infect the firmware with something like Der Starke (see below).\nIt\u2019s a silent attack and it would fool anyone. The accessory remains infected so you could end up attacking multiple Macs with the same device.\nDoes this sound familiar? Because when I read this, I instantly remembered Thunderstrike 2 . Xeno Kovah and Trammell Hudson described the exact same exploit at Black Hat in 2015, three years after the CIA\u2019s document.\nApple has fixed the exploit around the same time, so you should be fine.\nKey lessons:\nAlways update to the latest version of macOS to get the most recent security fixes\nDon\u2019t buy a Thunderbolt accessory on eBay\nTriton v1.3 & Der Starke v1.4\nTriton is quite a powerful malware . Once installed, the CIA can get files and folders from your computer. The CIA can install it from anywhere as long as they can mount your hard drive to their /Volumes folder. If that sounds scary, Der Starke is another beast altogether.\nDer Starke v1.4 released in 2013 was working perfectly fine on Macs released in 2013 running OS X 10.7. It\u2019s more or less the same thing as Triton, but much more sneaky .\nFirst, it\u2019s a diskless malware, meaning that you won\u2019t be able to find it on your hard drive. Der Starke infects your Mac firmware and works well with the Sonic Screwdriver exploit for instance \u2014 when you combine multiple exploits, you can do dangerous things. You can also install it from a USB thumb drive or hard drive.\nLike Triton, the CIA can get data from your computer, but it remains as silent as possible. When it uploads data, it mimics a browser process so that it looks like you\u2019re just uploading a photo to Facebook. Apps like Little Snitch can\u2019t even detect it.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Triton and Der Starke still work today. I\u2019ve reached out to Apple and will update this post when the company gets back to me.\nKey lesson:\nYou should install Little Snitch , Little Flocker and BlockBlock\nDarkSeaSkies v1.0\nThis is quite an old exploit as it was built to target the original MacBook Air and OS X 10.5. Just like Der Starke, DarkSeaSkies would infect your firmware in order to upload data from your computer. DarkSeaSkies is the generic name to describe three different malwares with funny names \u2014 \u201cDarkMatter,\u201d \u201cSeaPea\u201d and \u201cNightSkies.\u201d\nDarkMatter was the firmware malware that installed the other two tools on the hard drive.\nSeaPea was responsible of hiding all files, processes and network events from the user.\nNightSkies let the CIA remotely run commands on your Mac and get data from your computer.\nIt sounds like Der Starke, but less elaborate. I think the CIA probably abandoned those tools in favor of Der Starke and Triton.\nNightSkies v1.2\nThere\u2019s one exploit in particular that is about the iPhone. The CIA released an iPhone version of NightSkies v1.2 in December 2008 to get as much data as possible from your phone. Let\u2019s just say that this hack is quite ancient. It\u2019s quite funny to parse the CIA\u2019s document about it. It says that the hack works with iOS 2.1 and the iPhone 3G.\nIt was quite powerful as NightSkies could access your address book, SMS conversations and call logs in order to upload it to the CIA\u2019s servers. The agency could also execute commands on the iPhone remotely to install new tools and more.\nThe installation method also looks ancient as you had to use iTunes and plug the iPhone to a computer. The CIA created infected IPSW firmware files to flash the iPhone with this custom version of iOS.\nSo if you downloaded new versions of iOS on The Pirate Bay back in 2008 and were all about jailbreaking your phone, maybe you installed this malware on your good old iPhone 3G.\nApple has considerably increased the security of iOS. IPSW firmware files are now signed by Apple through their servers, so it\u2019s technically impossible to install old vulnerable versions of iOS using iTunes. Moreover, you need to type your passcode to update the operating system. If you don\u2019t know the passcode, there\u2019s no way to flash the firmware.\nKey lessons:\nAlways update to the latest version of iOS to get the most recent security fixes\nUse a strong passcode (at least six numbers or, even better, an alphanumeric password)\nUpdate your iPhone over the air by going to the Settings app on your phone so you don\u2019t have to use iTunes\nKeep your phone with you so you\u2019re sure nobody is installing a custom firmware behind your back\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-23T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "WikiLeaks' Dark Matter documents reveal CIA hacks for Macs and iPhones", "content": "WikiLeaks' Dark Matter documents reveal CIA hacks for Macs and iPhones\nTweet\nIt's only a couple of weeks since WikiLeaks unleashed the first batch of its Vault 7 CIA documents , revealing the agency's spying and hacking capabilities. Now the organization has released a second cache of files dubbed Dark Matter, and they show that the CIA has developed tools for hacking Apple products.\nBold and exciting names like Sonic Screwdriver, DerStarke, Triton and DarkSeaSkies are the monikers given to attack the firmware of MacBooks and iPhones. What's particularly interesting about the documents is that they appear to show that the CIA had the ability to exploit Apple hardware and software a full decade ago.\nNot all of the hacks revealed in Dark Matter are quite so old, however. The user guide for Sonic Screwdriver , for instance, was updated as recently as November 2012. It shows how a Thunderbolt or USB port can be used to infect and access a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, right up to mid-2012 models. While this is an attack that would require physical access to a machine, it would also be very easy to fool a user into infecting their own computer -- or even several computers.\nIntroducing the latest -- and smaller -- batch of documents, WikiLeaks says :\n\"DarkSeaSkies\" is \"an implant that persists in the EFI firmware of an Apple MacBook Air computer\" and consists of \"DarkMatter\", \"SeaPea\" and \"NightSkies\", respectively EFI, kernel-space and user-space implants.\nDocuments on the \"Triton\" MacOSX malware, its infector \"Dark Mallet\" and its EFI-persistent version \"DerStarke\" are also included in this release. While the DerStarke1.4 manual released today dates to 2013, other Vault 7 documents show that as of 2016 the CIA continues to rely on and update these systems and is working on the production of DerStarke2.0.\nAlso included in this release is the manual for the CIA's \"NightSkies 1.2\" a \"beacon/loader/implant tool\" for the Apple iPhone. Noteworthy is that NightSkies had reached 1.2 by 2008, and is expressly designed to be physically installed onto factory fresh iPhones. i.e the CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008.\nThis last allegation is interesting. Having seemingly developed the ability to infect iPhones at factory level, did the CIA ever implement such a project?\nApple has said that it fixed \"many of the issues\" exposed in the first data dump from WikiLeaks, but it's not clear how many of these latest revelations have also been addressed.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-23T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

It is described as \u201ca mechanism for executing code on peripheral devices while a Mac laptop or desktop is booting.\u201d\nSonic Screwdriver allows the CIA to modify the firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-ethernet adapter so that it forces a MacBook to boot from an USB stick or DVD disc even when its boot options are password protected.\n[ Further reading: Everything you need to know about iOS 12 ]\nFor example, Sonic Screwdriver can be used to boot into a Linux live CD so that the MacBook\u2019s partitions and data can be accessed from outside macOS, the manual says.\nMore importantly, an adapter modified by Sonic Screwdriver can be used to execute Der Starke, a fileless macOS malware program that has a persistence component installed in the computer\u2019s EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface).\nThe EFI or UEFI is the low-level firmware that initiates and configures the computer\u2019s hardware components before starting the actual operating system. It is the modern equivalent of the BIOS.\nAn EFI implant, or rootkit, can inject malicious code inside the operating system\u2019s kernel during the boot process and will survive even if the OS is fully reinstalled or the hard disk drive is changed.\nDer Starke is described in another CIA document that was leaked Thursday as \u201ca diskless, EFI-persistent version of Triton,\u201d which is \u201can automated implant for Mac OS X\u201d\u2014spying malware that can steal data and send it to a remote server.\nAn older implant, and possibly Der Starke\u2019s precursor, is described in a document from 2009 for MacBook Air computers under the codename DarkSeaSkies. It too has an EFI persistence module and includes a user-space module codenamed Nightskies.\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Nightskies is that it was ported to the MacBook Air from a version for iPhones. According to WikiLeaks, the iPhone version of Nightskies is designed to be physically installed onto factory-fresh phones.\nThis suggests that the CIA is compromising the supply chain and is potentially intercepting and infecting electronic device shipments before they reach the final buyer. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013 suggested that the U.S. National Security Intelligence Agency engages in similar practices.\nThe ability to install rootkits inside the EFI of Mac computers is not new. Australian security researcher Loukas K, better known in the security community as Snare, presented a proof-of-concept EFI rootkit for Macs at the Black Hat security conference in 2012. Snare has since been hired by Apple.\nIn 2014, another security researcher named Trammell Hudson developed a way to infect the EFI of Mac computers through malicious Thunderbolt devices. Apple fixed some of the vulnerabilities that made that attack possible, but the following year Hudson created another version of the exploit, dubbed Thunderstrike 2, together with researchers Xeno Kovah and Corey Kallenberg.\nApple again fixed some of the vulnerabilities that made Thunderstrike 2 possible, and a few months later the company hired Kovah and Kallenberg.\nGiving that Apple now has at least three security researchers who specialize in EFI attacks and that the company has hardened its firmware against such exploits significantly since 2012, it\u2019s possible that the CIA\u2019s Der Starke\u2019s implant doesn\u2019t work on the company\u2019s latest devices.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe ability to bypass EFI password protection and boot from a peripheral device\u2019s Option ROM has also been known since 2012 and was actually mentioned in Snare\u2019s Black Hat presentation. This method, which is used by the CIA\u2019s Sonic Screwdriver Thunderbolt adapter was finally blocked by Apple in macOS Sierra 10.12.2, released in December.\nAfter WikiLeaks released the first batch of CIA documents earlier this month, Intel Security released a tool that can help computer administrators verify if the EFI/UEFI has any malicious code.\nDuring a press conference Thursday, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said that newly released documents are just a small part of the cache of CIA documents that his organization has but has not yet published.\nWikiLeaks previously promised to share unpublished information about CIA exploits and vulnerabilities with technology companies with affected products. The organization then asked vendors to agree to certain terms before it discloses the information.\nAssange clarified Thursday that those terms don\u2019t involve money or anything like that, but rather a commitment from vendors that they will patch any flaws disclosed to them within an industry standard time period of 90 days\u2014with a possible extension for hard-to-fix vulnerabilities.\nTo comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-23T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

For Real This Time\nGetty Images\nPhone Companies Will Soon Banish Robocalls. For Real This Time\nGetty Images\nIf Democrats, Republicans, and the telecommunications industry can agree on anything, it's that robocalls are the worst. That's why the Federal Communications Commission passed rules today that expand the authority of phone companies to block unwanted phone calls. Short version: If a phone number seems at all likely to be bogus, companies can block it.\nThe law forbids marketers from calling people who are on the Do Not Call list. Yet according to the FCC, consumers last year received about 2.4 billion robocalls per month. And these calls are more than just an annoyance: Last year the IRS estimated that scammers posing as tax collectors used robocalls to make off with about $26.5 million from the public.\nMore FCC\nSo the FCC Head Says the Media Isn\u2019t the Enemy. In 2017, That\u2019s News\nThe FCC receives more complaints every month about robocalls than any other issue. But the agency struggles to track down culprits because most hide their real numbers using the same sorts of technology that make it possible to use a standard phone number with your Skype or Google Voice account. In most cases, the FCC says, robocallers don't even use real phone numbers. They rely on mimicking inactive or unassigned phone numbers\u2014spoofing, in industry lingo.\nWith tracking down the culprits out of the question, phone companies have turned to automated blocking tools like Nomorobo , which blocks known robocallers while whitelisting emergency numbers. This practice is perfectly legal under FCC rules\u2014in fact, the agency actively encourages carriers to provide customers with these types of tools. But some companies, including AT&T, complained that FCC rules against blocking calls prohibited them from aggressively targeting telemarketers for fear of accidentally blocking legitimate callers.\nToday the FCC approved a proposal created in collaboration with a \" strike force \" that included AT&T, Apple, Google, and Comcast. Once the proposal's rules go into effect, carriers will have permission to block all calls from numbers that can't possibly be valid, such as those that aren't assigned to anyone or phone numbers that simply don't exist (like \"000-000-0000\").\n\"There is no reason why any legitimate caller should be spoofing an unassigned or invalid phone number,\" FCC chair Ajit Pai wrote in a blog post announcing the proposal. \"It\u2019s just a way for scammers to evade the law.\"\nIt's possible scammers will move on to another technique once the proposal goes into effect, but for the time being at least your carrier can no longer blame the government for not blocking most robocalls.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-23T11:00:55Z", "images": []}

Customers might prefer non-U.S. products that don't have law enforcement access.\nOn Thursday, Comey said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be any part of chasing the innovation from this great country to other places.\u201d\n[ Prepare to become a Certified Information Security Systems Professional with this comprehensive online course from PluralSight.

That might result in \u201cinconsistent standards\u201d that hurt the U.S. companies, when it comes to their international business.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a danger that we, the mother and father of all this innovation, will be the last to solve it (the encryption problem),\u201d he said.\nComey didn\u2019t elaborate further on his idea, but privacy experts are calling it unrealistic.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes sense,\u201d said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California Berkeley.\nComey\u2019s idea means that all countries will essentially agree to weaken the security in their vendors\u2019 tech products, Weaver said. However, other countries will balk, fearing that the U.S. might exploit the cooperation for spying purposes.\n\u201cWould you still use a U.S. product, even if you know the NSA (National Security Agency) could have the rights to it?\u201d he said.\nOthers think any mandated government access to tech devices risks cyberespionage from U.S. rivals. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOnce you build that backdoor good luck trying to keep the Russians and Chinese out,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, an attorney with the privacy advocate the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nNevertheless, the FBI director has been more vocal in recent weeks about reigniting the encryption debate.\nOn Thursday, he said the FBI had been trying to unlock 2,800 electronic devices, collected from federal agents and local police in criminal investigations. However, the FBI has failed to open 43 percent of them, even with classified techniques.\nAlthough private companies are generating today\u2019s technology, Comey said: \u201ctheir job is not to decide how the American people should live. The American people should decide how they live.\u201d\nLast year, the FBI publicly feuded with Apple over gaining access to a locked iPhone from the San Bernardino shooter.

{"title": "Apple says recent WikiLeaks CIA docs detail old, fixed iPhone and Mac exploits", "content": "Matthew Panzarino @Panzer / 2 years\nApple says that its preliminary assessments of the WikiLeaks documents released today indicate that the vulnerabilities it details for iPhone and Mac were fixed years ago. The documents, which originated with the CIA, detailed a variety of methods for compromising \u2014 breaking into \u2014 Apple devices if an agent was able to gain physical access to the device.\nThe leaks were a part of the \u201c Vault7\u2033 documents , which WikiLeaks has been dribbling out. Some of the exploits, like NightSkies, could access personal info like call logs and SMS conversations \u2014 but only with physical access.\nApple\u2019s full statement is as follows\nWe have preliminarily assessed the Wikileaks disclosures from this morning. Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released. Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013.\nWe have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information.

{"title": "Pay to play: how sports bodies keeping winning the TV great rights battles", "content": "Live sport is one of the most valuable assets there is, says Harold Mitchell.\nCredit:Simon Bosch\nAustralia's sporting bodies have never looked back. The major commercial networks were by now competing with the ABC and each other for the broadcast rights to cricket, tennis and the major football codes.\nLegendary Australian ad man Harold Mitchell, who has tracked Australia's sporting market for more than four decades, says there is no end in sight for the rise of rights deals, despite the difficult times the free-to-air networks are enduring.\n\"Live sport is one of the most valuable assets there is, and it has been for decades,\" says Mitchell. \"Look at the top-rating television shows in any given year and you will see the list is completely dominated by live sport.\"\nMitchell is right. Last year, the top five rating televisions shows in Australia were, in order, the AFL grand final, game one of State of Origin, the NRL grand final, game two of State of Origin and then episode one of Molly, the mini-series documenting the life of Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum.\nAd man Harold Mitchell was also chairman of the Melbourne Rebels.\nCredit:Luis Enrique Ascui\nAccording to the ratings figures, live sporting events were six of the top 10 television programs, and 32 of the top 50 television events for the year.\nRalph Rivera, managing director of Eurosport Digital, summed it up at a conference in London this week. \"Sport, unlike any other content type, still drives scale and passion in terms of live viewership,\" he said. \"If you were to create the pyramid of content types that are really driving that level of engagement and scale, sport would have to be at the top of that.\"\nSet and forget\nThe audience numbers have resulted in a golden era for Australia's major sporting codes.\nIn August 2015 the AFL finalised a colossal six-year, $2.5 billion broadcast rights agreement with Seven, Foxtel and Telstra, running from 2017 to 2022. The new deal lifted the AFL's broadcast rights from $250 million a year to $418 million a year.\nJust two months later, after a drawn-out and sometimes hostile negotiation, the National Rugby League signed a $1.8 billion five-year television rights deal covering the 2018-2022 seasons. Under that deal, Nine and Fox Sports share live matches on big-screen formats, and Telstra has the digital and mobile device rights.\nFootball Federation Australia and Fox Sports have struck a six-year deal, worth a reported $346 million in total, for the A-League.\nNetball Australia has a deal with Nine and Telstra for big-screen broadcast rights on commercial television and Telstra TV.\nOf the major sporting codes, only domestic cricket remains in play. It has been reported that Fox Sports is set to bid for cricket broadcast rights for the Big Bash League, potentially partnering with incumbent international rights holder Nine, to take on Ten, which has enjoyed a huge success over the summer with the domestic T20 game. Some suggest Cricket Australia could be staring at a $300 million payday for a sporting competition that didn't even exist only a few years ago.\nWith the majority of contracts locked in, 2017 should be a season of \"set and forget\" for the major sporting codes. But one of Melbourne's most experienced sports negotiators, who has been in the room with major networks and sporting codes for more than a decade, says that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\"I can tell you that, right now, the AFL and NRL have dedicated teams looking at the future of sport rights, what is happening all over the world, and have an eye to what the playing field will be like in 2022,\" says the industry veteran, who cannot be named due to contract obligations.\n\"You only have to look overseas, where telecommunications companies and internet companies are becoming major players in sports rights. Who's to say that Nine and Seven won't be competing with Telstra, Apple and Facebook in five years?\"\nNRL chief executive Todd Greenberg admits the sporting codes are already looking at what the future landscape of sport rights may be like.\n\"We think we are just at the forefront of this technological revolution, but there is so much room to grow,\" says Greenberg. \"We also have a lot to learn as well, about the behaviours and habits of our fans. There is a lot of learning to be had. It's not just learning to be had by rugby league. We talk regularly with Gill McLachlan and his team at the AFL. We are all in close collaboration with them to understand consumer behaviour, because we are all trying to answer the same question. How will consumers want to watch sport in the future?\"\nFor McLachlan and his team at the AFL, a valuable lesson was delivered in round one of the newly launched AFL Womens competition. \"We had 2.6 million minutes of womens AFL football streamed by Telstra in round one,\" McLachlan says. \"That's 2.6 million minutes of a brand new product, going to a new audience.\"\nThe rise of the telcos\n(From left) NRL CEO Todd Greenberg, Acting Chief Executive of Netball Australia, Marne Fechner, NRL player James Tedesco, netball player Kristina Manu'a, AFL player Isaac Heeney and AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan.\nCredit:Peter Braig\nRupert Murdoch's British pay-TV empire is already feeling the heat from new players. BT Group, the privatised corporation formed from the old British Telecom, had not broadcast a single sporting match as recently as 2013.\nThat year, BT Sport acquired the rights to Serie A, Ligue 1, Brasileir\u00e3o and Major League Soccer, all of which were previously held by ESPN. BT then stunned the sporting world by securing the rights to 42 Premier League matches per season, as well as paying \u00a3897 million ($1.467 billion) for exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.\nIn 2015 a bidding war between BT and Sky drove the value of the live TV Premier League rights to more than \u00a35.14 billion over the three seasons, the equivalent of \u00a310 million per game.\nThen, earlier this month, the bidding war reached a new level. BT Sport paid \u00a31.18 billion to beat out Sky for Champions League football rights in the UK, nearly \u00a3300 million more than it paid in 2013. The deal has, for the time being, effectively taken Champions League football off free-to-air TV in the UK.\nIn an ironic twist, just days after announcing that deal, BT boss Gavin Patterson spoke at the annual Enders Analysis conference in London and told the audience that \"rampant inflation in sports rights\" has to end because the increases in prices could not persist. \"Naturally when we came in [to the market] there would [always be] be some inflation,\" he said. \"The sport market is pretty saturated in terms of viewers and consumption today. I do hope at some point in the future we can find a stable equilibrium.\"\nTelstra makes its move\nIn February, at its season launch, Telstra put AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan and NRL CEO Todd Greenberg on the same stage, along with Netball Australia's acting CEO Marne Fechner. The thought of the bosses of the NRL and AFL sharing a stage to launch their seasons would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. \"It probably says something about the power and attraction of Telstra,\" says Mitchell, who is chairman of Free TV Australia.\nFor Mitchell, it is no surprise that the two major winter codes, the AFL and NRL, have formed long-term alliances with Telstra.\n\"You look overseas, at what the telcos and technology companies are doing, BT in England, at the new players in the market, and you know it is coming here,\" Mitchell says. \"The digital age is bringing the greatest change to sporting rights deals we have seen in decades, and it is wonderful news for the sporting codes. All you need in a market is competitive tension. It is pretty easy to see where the competition is coming in the next five years. Live sports is the most valuable viewing asset out there, and the technology companies will want to be part of it.\"\nAccording to Michele Garra, executive director Telstra Media, the growth in the digital audience is already happening in Australia.\nViewers on Telstra's NRL app increased 26 per cent from the 2014 season, and then a further 127 per cent last season.\nThe AFL app saw a modest 19 per cent increase from the 2014 to 2015 seasons, and then a massive 140 per cent rise last season.\nThe numbers this year have grown again. According to Garra, Telstra will reach the 3 million viewer mark per round for the first time in 2017. \"Just in round one of the NRL, the Queensland Cowboys and Canberra Raiders saw us achieve a record number [64,000] unique viewers for a match,\" Garra says. \"Our customers want to use our product to complement the live game, and also as a primary way to watch the game live when out and about.\"\nFor Rivera, the growth of digital channels \u2013 such as Telstra's apps \u2013 is the future of sports viewing around the globe.\n\"Digital is not a business strategy, but simply a reaction to how the consumers are choosing to access the content,\" he told a London conference. \"They're looking at digital-first experiences because they can get a richer experience that goes beyond just the video \u2026 If you get the video, you get the data, you get the social layer around it, and you get the right sort of calibre of stream on a tablet. I'm choosing that before I choose plain old television.\"\nGreenberg can watch the seeds of change in his own lounge room, where his own teenage children consume their sport and entertainment almost exclusively on handheld devices, even if the same match is on the big screen.\n\"There is no doubt by the time we get to the end of this next deal, in 2022, that the behaviours of fans and how they consume the game will be massively different to what they do today,\" Greenberg says. \"What the answer is to that I don't think anyone truly knows. If they tell you they know, they are guessing. What we will do is listen and evolve really carefully, and partner with companies such as Telstra to find those solutions.\"\nThe view at home\nThe questions hanging over the major sporting codes in Australia are whether or not they will be able to land the same kind of growth in 2022 as they did for the last rights deals. And whether Foxtel, like British cousin Sky, will be priced out by new players.\nAustralia has one unique factor that limits the kind of competition between BT and Sky that Britain has witnessed. It is the legally enshrined anti-siphoning list, which prevents culturally important sporting events from being snapped up by pay-TV. The AFL and NRL competitions are both listed, along with events such as the Melbourne Cup. It is the reason why free-to-air networks remain central to the deals for the rights to the major football codes.\nGreenberg admits the three-way deal the NRL has in place is a hedge, with a free-to-air partner, a pay-TV partner and a telco partner. \"I think a hedge is fair way to typify it, the future is a long way off,\" Greenberg says. \"Telstra is the lowest base and the fastest growth of the audiences, but it is definitely the biggest opportunity of the three.\"\nMitchell, in his role as chairman of Free TV, is obviously defensive of those anti-siphoning restrictions. \"The anti-siphoning laws do protect the interests of the average Australian,\" he says. But Mitchell doesn't think the list and their restrictions will prevent competition from giving both the AFL and NRL another remarkable payday in 2022.\n\"The digital and technology companies will want a piece of the action for the exact same reasons as everyone has wanted a piece of the action,\" Mitchell says. \"All you need is a competitive market, and the clever football codes know this. They are working away in the background making sure they have a competitive market when they next go out to the market. Once upon a time that competitive market was the television networks. Next time the online and digital platforms will compete head to head.\"\nMitchell's view is supported by a man who has been at the heart of sports rights negotiations in Victoria for more than a decade, but who cannot be identified due to contract limitations. \"Today is not what tomorrow will look like, but you can get a glimpse at some of things that will happen in Australia in terms of sports rights by looking overseas,\" he says.\n\"Yahoo!, BT, Twitter, Facebook. The companies looking at sports content overseas is growing. It will come down to how the codes can slice and dice their content. The AFL made a very clever move in owning its production. That gives it options. In the end, the basics of market economics will dominate. When you sell your house, you want to get as many people as possible through the house to increase the number of bidders. By the time 2022 rolls around, and you can see the number of bidders being greater than now ... that's where telcos and tech companies will change the landscape.\"\nAnd that could well leave Foxtel exposed. Optus has already struck a blow, stunning the market by spending $100 million to steal the rights to the Australian Premier League rights from Foxtel.\nOne AFL insider points out that Foxtel's best audience for a sporting event was the All Blacks and Wallabies Rugby World Cup semi-final in 2011. \"That was a long time ago,\" he says. \"It was just over 700,000 viewers, and they haven't come close to that kind of audience since. You have to wonder, if Telstra sells its stake in Foxtel, what the future holds for pay-TV.\"\nMark Hawthorne is Senior Editor of The Age\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-24T22:57:01Z", "images": []}
{"title": "U.S.-Backed Efforts To Promote Openness And Democracy Are At Risk In The Age Of Trump", "content": "By Steven Melendez\n7 minute Read\nSecure, online communication has gone mainstream since the election. Downloads of Signal , the encrypted messaging tool, have jumped dramatically , as have those of browsers for accessing the web through the anonymizing Tor network. News outlets including the Washington Post and the New York Times have advertised secure digital channels for sources to send anonymous tips. Even Trump administration insiders have reportedly taken to communicating through Confide , a previously obscure app for sending disappearing text messages.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nBut years before Trump took over the government, secure digital communication tools including Signal and Tor have been receiving substantial funding from a perhaps surprising source: the U.S. taxpayer. Since 2012, an organization called the Open Technology Fund (OTF) has operated within an often overlooked offshoot of the U.S. government that traces its origins back to the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe broadcasts that took otherwise censored information\u2014and highlighted American culture and prosperity\u2014behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War.\nIt\u2019s a natural extension of a decades-long policy of challenging oppressive regimes by promoting the free flow of information, writes Emily Metzgar, an associate professor at The Media School at Indiana University who has written about U.S. international broadcasting, in an email to Fast Company. \u201cThe Open Tech Fund\u2019s efforts today are a natural extension of this longtime U.S foreign policy priority,\u201d she says. \u201cThe tools the Fund has helped develop are, as the group\u2019s annual report indicates, available in more than 200 languages for users in almost as many countries.\u201d\nTechnically, the OTF is a program of Radio Free Asia, one of several overseas-focused journalistic services funded by Congress through an agency called the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The OTF has become a kind of Y Combinator for the nonprofit, open internet, delivering funding to projects like Tor and Signal, the secure operating system distributions Tails and Qubes , and locally focused efforts like the Vietnam Open Internet Project , often at earlier stages and with fewer hoops to jump through than large private foundations. Advisers to the organization include activist Cory Doctorow; cryptographer Bruce Schneier; Mozilla head of public policy Chris Riley; Apache cofounder and Google engineer Ben Laurie; Slack senior staff security engineer Leigh Honeywell; and Kevin Bankston, director of the New America Foundation\u2019s Open Technology Institute.\n\u201cOn their website, they say, \u2018Here\u2019s what you do, here\u2019s what you need to say, here\u2019s how you do it,\u2019\u201d says Nathan Freitas, founder of The Guardian Project , an OTF-funded initiative that creates secure smartphone apps. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be even established if you come in with a solid idea.\u201d\nThe OTF\u2019s budget is inexpensive by the standards of government programs, and laughably small for a tech incubator\u2014its reported budget last year was $7.5 million, compared to $27 million that Y Combinator invested in early-stage startups. Yet it faces an uncertain future under President Donald Trump.\nTrump hasn\u2019t spoken specifically about any plans for overseas news agencies, but it\u2019s been repeatedly rumored that he may call on Congress to cut funding to domestic public broadcasters like PBS and NPR, and he\u2019s publicly shown more interest in censoring hostile regimes on the internet than promoting free speech .\nadvertisement\nThat, in turn, has prompted populist leaders in Central and Eastern Europe to push back against nongovernmental organizations, according to a recent report from the New York Times . NGOs that support democracy and openness are especially at risk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication from this administration in terms of their rhetoric that this is the kind of thing that would be a high priority for them to support,\u201d says Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow who studies technology issues at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.\nThe Fund in particular has been a prominent backer of open source encryption tools, while Trump last year called on supporters to boycott Apple over their hard-to-break encryption . The OTF has funded GlobaLeaks , a platform letting whistleblowers securely leak data to the press; Trump has repeatedly taken to Twitter, vowing to crack down on leaks in his administration, and accused the media of fabricating anonymous sources .\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to predict how the Trump administration might address this ideologically fraught potential disconnect between the president\u2019s views on leaks and a broader institutional tradition for freedom of information,\u201d writes Metzgar.\nOther prominent conservative politicians haven\u2019t always been opposed to funding digital anti-censorship tools. The OTF got its start after members of Congress, including many prominent Republicans, felt frustrated in 2011 with the State Department\u2019s pace in implementing its own programs to combat internet censorship in countries like China and Iran.\n\u201cChina is also beginning to export its internet censorship technologies to other countries bent on controlling information,\u201d warned former Senator Richard Lugar (R-Indiana), in a report at the time. \u201cIn part because of this, and because U.S. international broadcasting must already use internet circumvention technology on a daily basis to reach its audience in countries such as China, Iran, Cuba, Belarus, and other closed societies, I have come to the conclusion that the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees these operations\u2014and not the State Department, which has been somewhat dilatory in disbursing the $50 million in internet Freedom funds granted by Congress\u2014should be the primary driver in the U.S. government on this issue.\u201d\nadvertisement\nU.S. international broadcasting agencies have a long history of promoting anti-censorship tools: During the Cold War, they sometimes broadcast instructions for building antennas to circumvent Communist governments\u2019 attempts to jam their signals. The organizations also are quite aware of the importance of protecting journalists and their sources, says Kevin Klose, a former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, pointing to the 2014 jailing in Azerbaijan of a reporter for that network who had covered human rights issues.\n\u201cThe premise is exactly the right premise. How do you get confidential lines open in order to provide quality verifiable information back to the people in all those regions and countries?\u201d says Klose, now a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism. \u201cI think the activity that has arisen out of [Radio Free Asia] follows in that goal.\u201d\nAnd when it comes to developing those secure communication tools, the OTF has a fairly good track record of picking projects that proved successful, and of ensuring that they remain open source, says Jillian C. York, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s director for international freedom of expression.\nServal , for instance, allows for phone-to-phone messaging when existing cell networks are down or blocked.\n\u201cOverall, I would say that its biggest successes still are what it set out to do, which is funding technologies, so tools, whether those are privacy tools like Tor or circumvention tools for people in countries like China,\u201d she says.\nYork served for a time on an OTF advisory board but says she left partly out of a concern about the Fund moving further into funding country-specific programming in a way that can seem to mirror U.S. political priorities.\nadvertisement\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff funded by OTF that deals with China,\u201d she says. ( FreeWeChat , for example, tracks censorship on the popular Chinese messaging platform WeChat.) \u201cYou don\u2019t see a lot of projects getting funded to combat censorship in Saudi Arabia the way you do China.\u201d\nStill, she offered praise for the Fund\u2019s overall transparency and close integration into the worldwide open internet community, including a fellowship program that places researchers and developers from around the world with organizations working in the field, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\u201cOurs was a U.S. citizen, but in a lot of cases, the fellows are people from other parts of the world who then get that experience of working with a bigger NGO in the U.S. or in Europe, for example, and then going back,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a fellow in that scene who wasn\u2019t incredibly grateful for that.\u201d\nIn response to interview requests for this article, the OTF pointed to published reports, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors did not make anyone available for an interview prior to publication.\nIf the Trump administration were to eliminate the Fund or substantially cut its budget, it would be likely to leave a gap in support for internet freedom-focused work.\n\u201cIf you look around for tech funding if you\u2019re a nonprofit, there\u2019s very few sources, and even fewer for those focused on enhancing freedom such as anonymity and security. OTF is one of the largest supporters of such technology,\u201d says Joshua Gay, communications director of the Tor Project.\nadvertisement\nStill, there\u2019s a possibility that private funding would pick up some of the slack. In its most recent annual report, the OTF noted that private foundations and other governments are increasing their support for such work, sometimes in direct coordination with OTF.\n\u201cVenture capitalists are also increasingly interested in fundamental technologies such as decentralization that have the potential to foster innovative new tools for at-risk communities,\u201d according to the report.\nAnd, adds Cato\u2019s Sanchez, support for civil liberties initiatives has risen in recent months along with interest in digital privacy.\n\u201cAt a time when the American Civil Liberties Union can raise [millions of dollars] in a weekend because people are worried about the Trump administration and civil liberties, it may be that there is enough private support to make projects like these viable,\u201d he says.\nadvertisement\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-24T16:00:00Z", "images": []}

A spokesperson for Whatsapp said, \"we are horrified by the attack carried out in London earlier this week and are cooperating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations\".\nGovernments and security agencies are facing an uphill struggle to keep up with new technology, and while the FBI has managed to unlock iPhones in order to obtain data, messaging tools are harder to crack.\nEncryption scrambles data using a proprietary code that can only be unlocked with a special key. In April 2016 WhatsApp gave its users encryption by default as well as complete control over the keys for all its messaging services, including photos, phone calls and group chats.

{"title": "Samsung may retake momentum with the S8 smartphone", "content": "TechWorld\nTwitter\nSamsung may retake momentum with the S8 smartphone\nDetails emerge before the Wednesday unveiling; it will be phablet-sized, with features including facial recognition and a voice assistant, and will offer a dock accessory\nMatt Hamblen (Computerworld (US)) 28 March, 2017 07:09\n-\nComments\nSamsung has a lot riding on its next smartphone, the Galaxy S8, which debuts on Wednesday at an event in New York City.\nReports on new features of the S8 have been unusually abundant. Many of the reports were confirmed by Computerworld with seven industry insiders who spoke on the condition they not be named.\nAccording to these sources, both the S8 and S8 Plus:\nwill be larger than the last generation;\nwill have no physical home button;\nwill have facial recognition, in addition to a fingerprint scanner, to verify the user;\nwill have a DeX docking device, sold separately;\nand will include a new voice assistant called Bixby .\nMany of these features were already reported by a KGI Security analyst and by Forbes and other websites. There have even been photos of the new devices from a German website WinFuture .\nRecovering from Note7 fiasco\nAfter its disastrous run with the Galaxy Note7 , which was recalled after some of the devices overheated and even exploded, the pressure is on Samsung to get it right. All told, more than 4 million Note7s were recalled at a cost of $6 billion.\nIn the rearview mirror, South Korea-based Samsung is also watching Chinese phone maker Huawei, which finished 2016 in third place globally for smartphone shipments, behind Apple in second place and Samsung in the top spot, according to IDC. Huawei says it wants to be No. 1 globally in five years.\n\"Samsung needs to recapture momentum after the troubles with the Note7,\" said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates, on Monday. \"The S8 gives Samsung a major opportunity to change the conversation and show consumers who are generally favorably disposed to Samsung that it can still deliver leading edge products that people will want to go out and buy.\"\nBased on early reports of the phone's features, Gold said, \"it's very likely that the S8 will do exactly that.\"\nFacial recognition and the DeX dock\nReports of facial recognition technology in the S8 first cropped up two weeks ago. The technology will be combined with fingerprint and iris detection for mobile payments with Samsung Pay, but could well be used for other authorizations.\nThe DeX desktop docking station, described as a small, round device, will rely on Citrix software to let users connect to Windows productivity apps, according to three people who have seen it. Citrix and Samsung would not comment, however, on any of these reports.\nDeX is expected to cost about $150, in addition to a starting price for the Samsung Galaxy S8 of about $800. The dock will have full-sized ports and an active cooling fan, giving users the ability to connect an S8 to a keyboard, mouse and large display.\nMany docking stations for phones have been introduced in the market, but none have sold very well, analysts said. Citrix Receiver software was installed in the Motorola Atrix about six years ago. Other similar concepts have come from Windows Mobile with Continuum, BlackBerry and HP's Elite X3 dock.\n\"There have been many [smartphone dock] attempts from many vendors and each time the experience improved, so I am very optimistic\" for Samsung's dock, said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \"The biggest challenge is whether apps that provide a good experience on a 6-in. phone display can [look good] on a 13-in. or even a 30-in. display. HP has gotten very close with X2 and virtualized apps.\"\nGold said the DeX, based on reports, is somewhat analogous to a laptop docking station. Various laptop docks only sell to about 10% of business users. \"Phone docks have not done well in the past, and there's no reason to believe this DeX will be a huge seller either,\" he said. \"It's a specialty device and will have some traction, but probably in the same range as laptop docking sales.\"\nNonetheless, Werner Goertz, a Gartner analyst, said docking stations connected to smartphones that emulate desktop user interfaces will gain traction in coming years as more mobile workers check into an office, airport lounge or hotel room to finish work using apps that require more space on both a monitor and keyboard than on a smartphone display.\nThe phone will also include an intelligent voice assistant called Bixby that will work by pushing a button on the side of the S8. It will work with preinstalled apps but Samsung will release a software toolkit to allow third-party developers to add Bixby capabilities to their apps and services.\nKeeping alive the larger smartphone trend\nBased on reports and sources who spoke to Computerworld, the S8 will be larger, with a 5.8-in. display, than the S7 and its 5.1-in. screen.\nMeanwhile, the S8 Plus will come with a 6.2-in. display, bigger than the 5.5-in. Galaxy S7 Edge , which it succeeds.\nThe screens on both the S8 and S8 Plus fall into the so-called phablet category that IDC and others first identified in 2011 to describe smartphones that are large enough to compete with tablets. IDC says any phone from 5.5 inches to 7 inches in size fits its phablet definition.\nGenerally, larger phones have done well. Last year, IDC predicted that phablets would grow from about 20% of all smartphones in 2015 to 32% by 2020.\nGiven the larger size and other new features of the S8, Samsung seems to recognize the need to please an aging smartphone audience. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone , and Apple is waiting in the wings with a big rollout of its next-generation device in the fall. Samsung has a lot to gain, or lose, with the S8. Samsung's event on Wednesday starts at 11 a.m. Eastern.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-28T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

My father started his career as a travelling salesman for the American drug company Eli Lilly, and managed to rise through the ranks to become one of the managing directors.\u00a0\nIt had always been his intention to send me to public school, which he did, when I was 11.\u00a0I didn\u2019t want to go, but he thought it would be the making of me. I went to Taunton school, where I was surrounded by children much wealthier than me. My father tried to drill into me that rather than being grand about money, I should be careful with it.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nNeed help sorting your finances? Find a financial adviser near you\nDid you feel well off as a child?\nYes. I was quite spoilt really. Whatever I wanted, I got. My mother was a stay-at-home mum and I remember being well looked after. My elder brother died following a road accident when he was 11 and I was about seven. So it just became me, then. One of the reasons my father sent me away to school was because he was concerned that if I\u2019d stayed at home my mother would be too interested in making sure I was OK. He didn\u2019t want me being mollycoddled.\nHow much pocket money did you get as a child?\nIt was probably the equivalent of 50p or \u00a31 a week today. I\u2019d spend it on sherbet dips.\nWhat was the first paid work you ever did?\nPacking drugs in the summer holidays at my father\u2019s firm when I was 15. I was paid \u00a310 a week. It was really hard work and everyone was well aware I was one of the bosses\u2019 kids, so I felt I had to do well.\nMartin Clunes as Doc Martin\nWhat was your first full-time job?\nAssistant stage manager at the Salisbury Playhouse, in 1968, for \u00a32 a week. My first task was mucking out the coalhouse at the back of the theatre for the ponies in Cinderella. I told myself: \u2018Yes, I\u2019m shovelling s***, but I\u2019m shovelling s*** in the theatre. I can only go up from here.\u2019 My father subsidised my wages with an allowance of \u00a315 a week, which was a terrific amount of money in those days.\nHave you ever been paid silly money per hour for a job?\nI did a strange commercial for McDonald\u2019s in the 1980s, in which I played the hunchback of Notre Dame and rang bells for my loved one, while craving a McDonald\u2019s hamburger. We shot it in Paris over two days, and I was paid \u00a35,000 in cash. I remember holding this wad of money \u2013 the equivalent of at least \u00a312,000 today \u2013 and thinking it was ridiculous.\nWhat was the best year of your life, in terms of the money you made?\nIt was 2014. I paid the highest rate of income tax that year: 45 per cent, which is levied on earnings above \u00a3150,000. The last two or three years have also been good. Doc Martin is hugely popular and I get residual fees from the repeats of the show, which are a percentage of what I originally earned. It\u2019s certainly lucrative. With the residuals from Doc Martin and other shows it was a bumper year.\nWhat\u2019s the most expensive thing you\u2019ve ever bought yourself, just for fun?\nA black Mini Cooper convertible bought second-hand for \u00a314,000.\nTreat:\u00a0Ian spent \u00a314,000 on a second-hand Mini\nWhat is the biggest money mistake you have ever made?\nLetting a firm claim back my mis-sold payment protection insurance instead of doing it myself. I got a nice windfall of maybe \u00a314,000 but \u00a36,000 went in fees. I don\u2019t think my father succeeded in teaching me to be careful with money. As soon as it comes in, it goes out again. There have been years when I\u2019ve had to plead with the taxman to let me roll over some of what I owed to the following year, or ask my agent to advance me fees for my TV work.\nAt one point, I maxed out five or six credit cards. I\u2019m not good with money. In fact, I\u2019m hopeless.\n> Learn how to claim back PPI yourself for FREE using our step by step guide and letter template\nAnd your best money decision?\nInvesting in an AXA Wealth pension fund, on the advice of my financial adviser, Tim Davies of Langham Financial. I started putting in \u00a31,000 a month about seven years ago and it is now worth \u00a3150,000. That was a pleasant surprise.\nAnother good decision was to delay claiming my state pension while I\u2019m still working, which means I\u2019ll get more when I finally take it. Having these retirement pots has given me terrific peace of mind.\nDo you own any property?\nTaxi: Ian spends \u00a360 to \u00a370 a week on Uber\nYes, I have my home, a two-bedroom new-build flat by the lock in Brentford. I bought it for \u00a3300,000 six years ago and it was valued a year or two ago at \u00a3460,000. I had a farmhouse in the Cotswolds, in Broad Campden, where I brought up my children. That was sold after I split up with my wife, the actress Kate Nicholls.\nHow much cash do you typically carry?\nUsually \u00a3150 to \u00a3200.\nDo you pay off all of your credit cards in full?\nFor years, I didn\u2019t, and ran up quite a debt, but I\u2019ve got them all down to zero now.\n>Skip to this is Money's round-up of the best credit cards \u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the one little luxury that you like to treat yourself to?\nAn Uber minicab. I\u2019ve got arthritis in my knees so I\u2019ve stopped using public transport and Uber everywhere I can at a cost of \u00a360 to \u00a370 a week. I also have every conceivable device Apple has made. I buy whatever they bring out within a matter of moments.\nIf you were Chancellor of the Exchequer, what would be the first thing you would do?\nI would make it easier and more tax-efficient to save in to a pension, and try to make people more aware of how important it is to do so. I\u2019d also increase the state pension.\nDo you think it is important to give to charity?\nYes. I always ask people who want a photograph to put \u00a31 towards my favourite charity. In just the last couple of years, I\u2019ve collected almost \u00a35,000. I support Marie Curie because the work its nurses do for terminally ill people and their loved ones in their own homes and hospices is so important.\nWhat is your number one financial priority?\nTo make sure that when I die, my children will get a little nest egg.

{"title": "This Ice Cream Is Made From Food Waste (It\u2019s Delicious)", "content": "This Ice Cream Is Made From Food Waste (It\u2019s Delicious)\nThe Portland-based Salt & Straw is releasing a new series of flavors crafted exclusively from food that otherwise would have ended up in the trash to bring attention to all the good food we throw away.\nPhoto: Leela Cyd Ross\nBy Eillie Anzilotti\n3 minute Read\nThe ice cream is a rich, off-white color, streaked through with warm brown apple butter that cuts the sweetness of the spiced-rum-flavored cream. On the menu of Salt & Straw , the Portland-based, small-batch ice cream institution, the unusual flavor combination is not out of place; Kim and Tyler Malek, the cousins behind Salt & Straw, have made a name for themselves selling offbeat takes on classic staples; their chocolate ice cream is laced with marshmallow fluff, and their strawberry holds hints of honey balsamic vinegar and black pepper.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nPhoto: Courtesy Salt & Straw\nBut when Second-Steeped Rum Spices and Apple Butter hits Salt & Straw\u2019s scoop shops in June, it\u2019ll draw attention for more than just its unique taste. Every four weeks, Salt & Straw rotates in a new themed seasonal menu, built around integrating other parts of the food world into ice cream. For instance, one menu focused on fermented flavors and used sourdough, fish sauce, and fermented honey. This coming June, the series will highlight rescued food; all the flavors will be constructed from food that might have otherwise ended up in the trash . The spices that flavor the apple butter flavor will be rescued from Portland\u2019s East Side Distillery, which makes rum by steeping whole spices\u2014Moroccan peppercorns, Sri Lankan cinnamon, Mexican vanilla, California orange peel. Salt & Straw will re-steep the rum-soaked spices in cream, then ribbon in the caramelized apple butter made from bruised apples that were destined to be tossed.\nPhoto: Leela Cyd Ross\n\u201cWe were really struck by the idea that we waste 40% of our food in the United States, and that children in our cities are going hungry,\u201d Kim Malek, who founded Salt & Straw in 2011, tells Fast Company. \u201cIf we were able to use that food, we could wipe out hunger.\u201d There are people, she adds, who are doing that work: For the June series, Salt & Straw is working closely with organizations like Urban Gleaners and the Portland Fruit Tree Project , which rescue and redistribute potentially wasted food among communities in need. \u201cWe thought: What if we use our menu in June to shine a light on those agencies and tell their story, and see if we can get our customers and the community at large to be more aware of and supportive of these organizations and the work that they\u2019re doing,\u201d Kim says. \u201cWe want to show that an apple might be kind of ugly , but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not perfectly tasty and should be thrown away. We could use it.\u201d\nPhoto: Courtesy Salt & Straw\nAround one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption\u2013 about 1.3 billion tons \u2013is lost or wasted each year. An independent, small-batch ice cream chain, says Tyler Malek, is not going to make a huge dent in that total; he estimates that June series will save around 2,000 pounds of food. But volume, he adds, isn\u2019t the whole picture. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re working with a lot of companies and trying to prove that there\u2019s a viable supply chain here,\u201d Tyler says. \u201cFor instance, we\u2019ll be paying fair market value for say, strawberries that a farmer was going to throw away because they were too ripe. That\u2019s actually perfect for us\u2013we\u2019re going to freeze them anyway. We\u2019re trying to prove that this food can be used, and tell our customers that it\u2019s possible to make something incredible and fun out of something that was going to be wasted.\u201d\nIn the summer months, each of Salt & Straw\u2019s shops is staffed by around 30 people, who are trained extensively in how to explain the origins and thought process behind each flavor; detailed descriptions of the seasonal flavors are also printed on in-store menus and on the website. (The Maleks are in the ice-cream business, but they\u2019re also storytellers; Tyler\u2019s process of dreaming up new flavors begins with conversations with the organizations and people he\u2019s working with. It\u2019s a matter of turning a narrative and a message into ice cream, he says, not the other way around.) On warm days, around 100 people file through each shop every hour. \u201cOur hope is that the collective power of our customers getting to learn about rescued food and the organizations working in this space will translate into support and awareness,\u201d Kim says.\nThough the rescued food series is limited to the month of June, Tyler and Kim see the partnerships they\u2019ve formed through the process of developing these flavors reverberating throughout their work going forward. Tyler is in talks with the Portland Fruit Tree Project, which works with houses that grow fruit but don\u2019t harvest it, about an ongoing collaboration; the organization is also selling to cider makers. \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made in rescuing food; that\u2019s the proof of concept,\u201d Tyler says.\nIt also tastes delicious.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-26T10:00:00Z", "images": []}

But on Friday, Beijing\u2019s intellectual property court disagreed and ruled in favor of Apple.\nThe product designs of the two companies contain differences, the court said. For instance, Apple\u2019s iPhone 6 contains a symmetrical exterior curve on the device, while the design patent from Baili uses an asymmetrical curve.\n\"This one difference has a significant impact on the overall look,\" the court said in a statement .\nThe two designs also feature other differences that average consumers can easily identify, the court added.\nState Intellectual Property Office\nThe smartphone design patent held by Shenzhen Baili.\nAccording to the court\u2019s statement, Baili said it will look over the judgment, before deciding whether to appeal.\nThe Chinese company has been warning Apple since 2014 about possible patent infringement.\u00a0However, while smartphone competition in China has been fiercely competitive, the company\u2019s handset business appears to be nonexistent .\u00a0The site for its 100C smartphone is no longer online and social media promotion for its products has remained inactive for over two years.\nBaili filed its lawsuit against Apple last year, asking the court to halt iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales in the country.\u00a0In response, Apple appealed the court order, which put the sales ban on hold.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"title": "Wells Fargo rolls out card-free access at all of its ATMs", "content": "Wells Fargo rolls out card-free access at all of its ATMs\nPatrick Sison / AP\nOn Tuesday, March 21, 2017, Wells Fargo announced plans to upgrade all 13,000 of its ATMs to allow customers to access their funds using their cellphones instead of traditional bank cards.\nOn Tuesday, March 21, 2017, Wells Fargo announced plans to upgrade all 13,000 of its ATMs to allow customers to access their funds using their cellphones instead of traditional bank cards.\n(Patrick Sison / AP)\nJonnelle MarteWashington Post\nLeft your wallet at home? You may still be able to grab some cash.\nStarting on Monday, Wells Fargo will be the first major U.S. bank to offer a card-free option at all of its ATMs. The bank's customers will be able to use their smartphones to access any of the bank's 13,000 ATMs. Other major U.S. banks have rolled out card-free ATMs in limited locations.\nHere's how it works: Customers must download and log into the Wells Fargo app on their smartphones and request an eight-digit code, which they can type into an ATM instead of inserting a debit card. Next, they enter their PIN, just as they would if they were using their cards.\nWells Fargo is offering the cardless option at a time when consumers are increasingly comfortable with using their phones to check their balances, deposit checks and transfer cash, says Jonathan Velline, head of branch and ATM banking for Wells Fargo. Using the phone to tap into an ATM is a logical next step, he says.\nThe card-free option can be more secure than using a debit card, Velline says, because it reduces the chance that fraudsters can steal and copy the numbers on your debit card. The smartphone app generates a unique code that expires within 30 minutes.\nPlus, consumers using the app have to prove their identity on their smartphones - either by providing their thumb print or by typing in their online banking password - in addition to entering their PIN numbers. (With your physical debit card, you only need to provide the PIN code.)\nConsumers can expect to see more cardless ATMs over the next couple of years. JPMorgan Chase is testing the technology at some locations, while Bank of America has introduced a card-free option at about half of its ATMs. For Bank of America, some machines currently accept mobile wallet programs, such as Apple Pay and Android Pay. Consumers need to only tap their smartphones on or near the ATM, provide their passcode or thumbprint on the phone, and then enter their PINs into the ATM. Wells Fargo says it is upgrading its ATMs to incorporate the digital phone readers and hopes to make the mobile wallet technology more widely available throughout this year and next year.\nBanks are also working on programs that can help people cue up transactions even before they reach the ATM. For example, Bank of America said it is rolling out a service this summer that lets customers use their smartphone apps to say how much money they want to withdraw and what kinds of bills they need. Then they show up at an ATM, sign in and collect the cash. (Requests expire within 24 hours.)\nUse of the card-free options is still in the early stages, says Sarah Grotta, who heads the debit card research for Mercator Advisory Group, a payments research firm. Consumers have been slow to use mobile wallet options such as Apple Pay, so it may be awhile before most people leave their debit cards at home, she says.\nStill, she expects the technology will catch on.\n\"People are interested in doing more with their phones,\" Grotta says. \"So eventually we will get there.\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-27T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Developers can finally respond to App Store reviews \u2013 here\u2019s how it works", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nWith yesterday\u2019s release of iOS 10.3\u00a0and macOS 10.12.4, Apple has made a significant change to how its App Stores operate. At long last, developers now have the\u00a0ability to respond to user reviews in order to offer support, ask follow-up questions, say thanks, or otherwise interact with their app\u2019s customers. The change has been a long time coming \u2013 the feature has been standard in Google Play since 2013 , and a huge headache for Apple\u2019s developer community over the years.\nNot only was the prior system a sore spot for developers, it was bad for consumers, too.\nIf an\u00a0app crashed on you or had some sort of weird bug, you might head over the App Store to leave a\u00a0complaint. This was often easier than trying to track down the developer\u2019s contact information, especially because many publishers\u00a0don\u2019t include an email address or support information in their App Store description.\nThose complaints could help developers identify new bugs or other previously unknown glitches, yet there was no way to reach out to the user to ask follow-up questions that could help them address the situation and create a fix.\nSome developers would even try various tactics to try to identify the user in question, simply to be able to ask more for information \u2013 like reverse engineering a\u00a0UserID to figure out which email was associated with the user\u2019s\u00a0account, for example.\nFinally! I use to have to reverse engineer their UserID to determine email for comments a crash in our app that we were desperate to debug\n\u2014 Tim Schallberger \ud83d\udeb4 (@tschallb) March 28, 2017\nIn addition, the lack of a review response system also prevented developers from fostering a sense of community around their apps. They couldn\u2019t respond to feedback about feature requests to explain their thinking, talk about where that feature was on the roadmap, nor could they thank users who shared kind words.\nBeing proactive by responding to issues that need addressing\u00a0isn\u2019t just about developing better software \u2013 it can also impact the developer\u2019s bottom line.\nWhen users feel the developer is paying attention and being helpful, they\u2019ll likely rate the app higher. Better rated apps will see more downloads, and then move up the charts on the App Store.\nWhat\u2019s New For Developers\nWith the launch of the new feature, Apple offers a series of suggestions about how developers should respond to reviews . It explains\u00a0that timely, clear and concise answers are best, and they should reflect the tone of the brand \u2013 even if multiple people write the responses. The company also suggests that developers should prioritize those reviews with lower star ratings, for obvious reasons.\nThe\u00a0users\u2019 reviews appear\u00a0iTunes Connect, the\u00a0dashboard where developers\u00a0manage the apps they offer for download on the App Store. A page will display the incoming reviews, allowing developers to now respond or report them. (Under App \u2013> Activity \u2013> Ratings and Reviews).\nThere are also filters for finding reviews from users in different countries, which can be helpful for triangulating reviews for\u00a0versions just rolled out to new markets.\nDeveloper responses\u00a0appear to go through a process of their own, MacStories discovered. (See below tweet). Some developers are\u00a0seeing responses marked as \u2018Pending,\u2019 for instance.\n\ud83e\udd17 Confirmed: you can use emoji in your iTunes Review developer responses! What a time to be alive!!! pic.twitter.com/oXSD7HZAL1\n\u2014 Panic Inc (@panic) March 27, 2017\nWhat\u2019s New for Users\u00a0\nFor consumers, the process of leaving a review hasn\u2019t changed, if in the App Store itself.\nHowever, developers have gained a new option for soliciting reviews in the app itself. By using the\u00a0 SKStoreReviewController API, developers can ask you\u00a0to rate or review an\u00a0app while you\u2019re actively\u00a0using it, without being redirected\u00a0to the App Store.\nThis will have a bigger impact in terms of collecting ratings and reviews from a larger audience, as many people dismiss the nagging review prompts today.\nEven better, the API restricts developers from asking for reviews more than three times per year , which will have a huge impact on user experience. Some apps (Tinder\u00a0comes to mind), literally ask\u00a0their\u00a0users for a rating\u00a0at some point during every single use. And once reviewed, the prompts can\u2019t reappear.\nUnfortunately, the option to completely disable review prompts for all installed apps, as promised is not appearing in the updated version of iOS, as it had in the beta.\nWe understand that this feature was actually pulled out early on in the developer betas, however, and will likely return in time.\nThe idea here is that Apple wants to give developers a grace period to implement the new API, so until that period wraps,\u00a0the user-facing \u201cdisable\u201d setting will not be available.\nAnother new feature for\u00a0users are email alerts that arrive if\u00a0a developer responds to your review.\u00a0Following the answer from the developer, the\u00a0email includes further prompts with links: \u201cDo you want to update your review?\u201d and\u00a0\u201cYou can also contact the developer.\u201d\nUsers get email if developer responds to review. And an option to update the review! pic.twitter.com/aOVnDFz8i6\n\u2014 Cocoanetics \uf8ff (@Cocoanetics) March 28, 2017\nIn the App Store itself, the responses are clearly labeled with arrows and the heading \u201cDeveloper Response,\u201d eliminating any confusion.\nThe reviews and responses are also timestamped, which is another means of seeing how quick the developer is handling incoming complaints. Only one response can be associated with any review, but developers are able to edit their answers, Apple notes .\nPlus, users can now use 3DTouch on a review to mark it as Helpful or Not Helpful.\nOne minor complaint is that the links a developer might provide \u2013 like to a support page or FAQ, for example \u2013 are\u00a0not functioning URLs. (See screenshot below).\nThis could make replies more time-consuming for developers who now have to type out instructions that are already on their site, and users won\u2019t be able to click the links directly.\nSeeing my review replies from ~8hrs ago hit public. I kinda like how this looks. pic.twitter.com/DbtsoXTuyF\n\u2014 Curtis Herbert (@parrots) March 28, 2017\nDevelopers are thankfully forbidden from manipulating reviews or incentivizing feedback, per Apple\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines . The\u00a0company clearly tells developers not to \u201coffer users an incentive to change their review ratings in your responses,\u201d as a means of keeping the review system honest.\nCertainly some developers will try to skirt this system, so it should be interesting to track how Apple handles those in violation.\nYesterday, Apple released new versions of its operating systems and an updated version of iTunes.\u00a0You\u2019ll only see these changes if you\u2019ve upgraded your Apple software to the latest version.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-28T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Warren / AP)\nJon GambrellAssociated Press\nAmazon purchased the Middle East's biggest online retailer Souq.com on Tuesday for an undisclosed amount, a day after a state-backed firm disclosed an $800 million counteroffer.\nA joint statement described the purchase as expanding Amazon's influence into the Mideast as the chairman of the state-supported firm Emaar prepares to launch his own retail website in a country known more for its luxury malls than online shopping.\nThat could put Seattle-based Amazon in a head-to-head competition with a firm helmed by one of the sheikhdom's favored business magnates.\n\"This is a milestone for the online shopping space in the region,\" Souq.com co-founder and CEO Ronaldo Mouchawar said in a statement.\nThe announcement said the two companies expect the sale to close this year.\n\"Together, we'll work hard to provide the best possible service for millions of customers in the Middle East,\" Russ Grandinetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, said in a statement.\nIn buying Souq.com, Amazon will leapfrog into the crucial Mideast markets of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where the Dubai-based retailer already has local operations.\nAs a private company, Souq.com hasn't had to file public earning reports, though the website last year raised more than $275 million in a round of financing that the company said would help fuel its future growth.\nSouq.com's status as a free-zone firm also means Amazon will be able to run a 100 percent foreign-owned operation. Amazon's entry into the UAE comes after Apple opened its first stores in the Arab world in Dubai and the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi in October 2015.\nThe website's major investors have included Tiger Global Management and South Africa-based Naspers.\nRumors about Amazon's interest in Souq.com have circulated for months. In November, Emaar chairman Mohamed Alabbar reportedly met Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at the state-backed firm's cavernous Dubai Mall, home to a massive aquarium and in the shadow of the Burj Khalifa , the world's tallest building it built.\nOn Monday, Emaar Malls made public its $800 million bid for Souq.com in a filing on the Dubai Financial Market. The short filing, signed by Emaar Malls vice chairman Ahmad Thani al-Matrooshi, said the bid was made \"in line with the strategy to align e-commerce with physical shopping.\"\nLast year, Alabbar received a $1 billion investment in a forthcoming e-commerce venture from the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund, the same sovereign wealth fund that invested $3.5 billion in the ride-hailing app Uber. That project, called noon.com, has yet to begin operations.\nAlabbar also holds stakes in the delivery company Aramex, which could prove useful for his online retailer.\nDubai, the commercial capital of the United Arab Emirates, home to the long-haul carrier Emirates and the world's busiest international airport, also has luxury malls that even include an indoor ski slope. Its summer heat of over 122 degrees Fahrenheit makes malls a major attraction for both shopping and leisure time in the city.\nWhile Uber and other online services firms work in Dubai, online retail shopping has yet to truly take off like it has in Western countries. Amazon's entry into the market likely will change that.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-28T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Apple\u2019s Augmented Reality Debut Will Look More Like \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d Than Magic Leap", "content": "Analysts say Apple may build AR features into iOS that utilize a 3D camera.\n[Photo: courtesy of Apple]\nBy Mark Sullivan\n3 minute Read\nWhen Apple launches its much-anticipated foray into augmented reality, it is likely to start with a version that works on your phone, not on a dedicated headset or pair of glasses, analysts say. Though somewhat underwhelming, it\u2019s a necessary first step for a technology that could eventually transform personal computing. AR technology is meant to superimpose digital imagery over the user\u2019s view of the world through a smartphone camera or a dedicated pair of glasses.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nApple now has reportedly \u201chundreds\u201d of engineers working on the company\u2019s efforts to build an AR wearable. Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman highlighted some key members of the team, including its leader, Mike Rockwell, an ex-Dolby Labs executive. Actually, Apple has been working on AR for more than a year, and the initiative has become harder to keep secret as the AR group has grown.\nThe face-mounted glasses seem more in line with Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s statements about the technology . Cook visited AR headset maker Magic Leap in Florida and is said to be excited about the potential of AR.\nWhile the phone-based AR may not be as captivating as the head-mounted AR, there is good reason to start there and release some kind of headset later on. \u201cApple\u2019s strategy may be to release a technology that gets people used to the idea, and then release a headset in a couple of years,\u201d says Technalysis Research chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a 3D depth camera something like Google\u2019s Tango . . .\u201d O\u2019Donnell says.\nApple has been working with Lumentum (formed when JDS Uniphase split in 2014) on 3D-sensing technology that will be in a new high-end iPhone coming later this year, ]as previously reported by Fast Company .\nThe main reason to start with the phone is that the technology needed for a headset simply is not available yet, O\u2019Donnell says. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear now that the core technology is available for anyone\u2014the display, the compute engine, as well as the battery,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. If Apple were going to release an AR headset anytime soon, the component parts would already be showing up at the companies that supply the components, he says.\nadvertisement\nNot only would the technology need to be available, but it would have to be well enough established so that manufacturing facilities would be capable of pumping out the millions of components required by Apple.\nCreative Strategies president and long-time Apple analyst Tim Bajarin also believes Apple AR will start in the phone: \u201cTheir entry into AR will most likely be through the iPhone in terms of the way they use their dual cameras and AI to deliver AR functionality to the iPhone via the iOS platform.\u201d\nBoth analysts also say that Apple is uniquely positioned for AR because of its ability to eventually design an AR headset or glasses that people will actually feel like wearing, coupled with its ability to create unique software experiences to go with the device.\n\u201cI see them being able to add virtual characters into live scenes that add images, animation, and data to all types of settings to deliver an enhanced AR experience,\u201d Bajarin says.\nApple always builds ecosystems around key products, and the success of its AI offering may depend on the development of cool AR content by third-party developers. Bajarin believes that Apple will likely issue a software development kit (SDK) to developers to help them develop new AR experiences for the iPhone. \u201cThat will help them [Apple] differentiate themselves from the competition and grow their market for iPhones,\u201d Bajarin says.\nAnd Apple\u2019s own apps will have to work beautifully in AR. \u201cTo be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments,\u201d Loup Ventures partner Gene Munster told Bloomberg. \u201cApple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off.\u201d\nadvertisement\nThe final question about AR is whether consumers want it, know how to use it, or even know what it is. Apple typically jumps into a product category after there\u2019s already an established market for the technology.\n\u201cWhile an established market certainly isn\u2019t a requirement for Apple to get involved in a particular space, the lack of competitors introduces a different kind of risk,\u201d says Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart. \u201cThere is a benefit to waiting in the wings and coming out with a product that addresses shortcomings found with existing products.\u201d\nadvertisement\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-28T22:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Term Sheet -- Friday, March 24", "content": "Term Sheet -- Friday, March 24\nCHASING RAINBOWS\nThe following is my column from the latest issue of Fortune. Find it online here .\nIn recent months I\u2019ve seen Facebook posts spark workplace arguments and inaccurate tweets go viral, distorting my understanding of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fiction. My cortisol levels have taken more than one roller-coaster ride when a devastating piece of information reverses itself on social media an hour later.\nWhatever your political persuasion, President Trump\u2019s short time in office has produced an exhausting amount of anxiety. More than half of people surveyed in January by the American Psychological Association reported substantial stress about the political climate. Meanwhile 29% of people said they have been less productive at work since the election, according to a survey by software startup BetterWorks.\nAllow me to offer a bit of hopeful counter\u00adprogramming. Technology startups often profess a desire to make the world a better place, and it can be fun to mock the idealism and self-\u00adimportance of such posturing. (Me? Never.) But amid today\u2019s daily deluge of leaks, fights, scandals, and tweets, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that some of them really are achieving positive progress in the world.\nTake Andela. The three-year-old startup trains software developers in Kenya and Nigeria and places them in remote jobs for international companies like IBM and Microsoft. The company has trained about 200 engineers; its ultimate goal is to foster a generation of great tech founders in Africa. Last year the company raised $24 million in funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the venture arm of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.\nOr Tala, a microlending startup based in Santa Monica. The company uses mobile device data to make microloans to people in Southeast Asia and East Africa who would otherwise have no access to credit, using location and transaction information from their smartphones to assess risk. With more than 80 employees, the company now delivers around 10.5 million loans per month. In February the two-year-old company raised $30 million in funding.\nBoth companies are examples of legitimate businesses intended to turn a profit for their investors and generate social impact. This style of investing\u2014often called \u201cimpact investing\u201d or \u201csocial good\u201d\u2014is increasingly popular with investors. (And magazines: Look for our Change the World issue in September.) ImpactBase, an online database, counts 417 funds with more than $31 billion in assets under management. Even private equity is getting in on the trend: The growth investment arm of TPG is raising a $2 billion impact fund called Rise.\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling inspired to trade social media for social good, consider Catchafire.org. The website allows professionals to donate something beyond money or physical labor\u2014e.g., sales savvy, coding competence, or PR prowess\u2014to causes ranging from cancer research to Meals on Wheels. Do it to make a difference in the world; do it to make a difference in your stress levels. I won\u2019t judge.\n***\nAlso from the latest issue: Our package on the Word\u2019s Greatest Leaders includes a profile of Jack Ma , as well as coverage of Brian Chesky and Elon Musk .\nNot on the list: Theranos is giving new shares to investors if they agree not to sue the company, the Wall Street Journal reports .

We don\u2019t know how you\u2019re supposed to hold it without blocking part of the screen, but hey, impressive.\n\u00a0\nSamsung\nUnder the hood\nIt\u2019s a Snapdragon 835 (or similar Exynos), with 4GB RAM, 64GB storage and the option to expand that via an SD card. It\u2019s also got, wonder of wonders, a headphone jack, and it\u2019s got Samsung\u2019s dust- and water-resistance baked in.\n\u00a0\nSamsung\nCameras\nThe selfie-cam on the Galaxy S8 is an 8MP F1.7 auto-focusing unit, and the main shooter is a 12MP F1.7 with optical stabilization and the rest of Samsung\u2019s previous generation imaging goodies.\n\u00a0\nSamsung\nBiometrics\nThe Galaxy S8 has a built-in iris scanner and face detector for main unlocking, and moves the fingerprint scanner to the back, safely out of the way of its awkwardly humongous screen. It\u2019s an impressive little sci-fi \u201cfuture is here\u201d moment, though it could also prove to be a headache if it doesn\u2019t function smoothly.\n\u00a0\nSamsung\nBixby\nIf you know what Alexa and Siri and Google Assistant do, you know the deal here \u2013 it\u2019s an AI assistant that you talk to instead of tapping out searches or app actions on the device with your finger. It\u2019s not nearly as functional as the competition at launch, but Samsung promises that general-knowledge questions and so forth will come soon.\n\u00a0\nSamsung\nBattery safety\nSamsung says that its new eight-point battery safety checks go \u201cbeyond the industry standard,\u201d and really, it\u2019s difficult to believe that Samsung wouldn\u2019t go all-out to make sure that the Galaxy S8 doesn\u2019t have any battery safety issues in the wake of the Galaxy Note 7 disaster.\n\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-29T15:37:00Z", "images": []}

The president also has a personal account on Facebook , as well as the official POTUS Facebook account .\nBut now President Trump has finally dumped his old Android device and moved to Apple\u2019s iPhone instead for his social media needs, according to Dan Scavino (the official White House Director of Social Media).\nScavino mentioned the president\u2019s change in a recent tweet:\nMore at Twitter\nAndroid\u2019s security problems\nIt\u2019s not surprising that President Trump finally made the switch to the iPhone, given Android\u2019s security problems. The Samsung phone that the president was using apparently had a lot of security issues, according to a report by Kaveh Waddell at The Atlantic:\nWhat happened? Some reporters speculated that Trump may have finally gotten an iPhone. Perhaps that old, unsecured Samsung\u2014so old, in fact, it can\u2019t run the newest, safest version of the Android operating system\u2014had been wrested from Trump\u2019s fingers from a brave, security-conscious aide.\nThat would\u2019ve been a relief to security experts who had warned for months about the dangers of Trump\u2019s attachment to that phone. The device, likely a Samsung Galaxy S3, has such serious security problems that it\u2019s probably \u201ccompromised by at least one\u2014probably multiple\u2014hostile foreign intelligence services and is actively being exploited,\u201d according to Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.\nThat would mean that foreign agents could be listening on his private conversations, monitoring him as he moves around the country, and potentially seeing the world through the eyes of his smartphone camera.\nMore at The Atlantic\nI\u2019m sure that the president\u2019s decision to switch to the iPhone will come as a relief to the Secret Service and other security professionals inside the government.

I would think that Samsundg have the damn things spontaneously errupting in to a VERY hot ball of fire was good enough to toss the Samsung, but was the FBI even concerned -- NOT!\nTrump has a lot more resources to point him in the right direction, and has taken advantage of it on occasion. \u201d\nWood1208: \u201cInstead of criticizing Mr. Trump, say Hala Lu Ya!!

What made today\u2019s announcements uncanny was just how many features Samsung unveiled in their new Galaxy S8 that we\u2019ve already heard reported for the\u00a0upcoming iPhone 8. The Galaxy S8 may not be iPhone fans want today, but it surely prepares them for what we may be seeing later this year.\nFans of Apple may scoff at one of\u00a0the company\u2019s biggest competitors, but a lot of the Samsung\u2019s announcements shared today line up with recent rumors for the iPhone 8. The new Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ includes wireless charging, an edge-to-edge display, a front-facing facial recognition camera, and a more deeply integrated assistant.\nWireless charging in the new Galaxy S8 and S8+ was already expected but the support of fast charging is welcome. The edge-to-edge display, affectionately named\u00a0an Infinity Display, shows off what Apple might be able to accomplish by pushing their display to the edges and thinning out the bezels. The Galaxy S8\u2019s front-facing camera also packs in a facial recognition camera, something we\u2019ve seen reported as being \u201c revolutionary \u201d in the iPhone 8. Samsung\u2019s assistant, Bixby, also took some of the\u00a0spotlight as it shows off just how deeply integrated across the OS it gets.

{"title": "Samsung hopes Galaxy S8 will reinvigorate company after combustible Note 7", "content": "Samsung hopes Galaxy S8 will reinvigorate company after combustible Note 7\nSamsung hopes Galaxy S8 will reinvigorate company after combustible Note 7\nAnick Jesdanun, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nPublished:\nMarch 29, 2017 4:24 PM MST\nFiled Under:\nCES 2019: Google brings a Disney-like ride to tech show\nNEW YORK \u2014 Samsung seems to be playing it safe with its first major smartphone since the embarrassing recall of its fire-prone Note 7.\nThe Galaxy S8 features a larger display than its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, and sports a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. But there is no increase in battery capacity, providing the battery more breathing room. The Note 7 pushed the engineering envelope with its battery, which contributed to a series of spontaneous smartphone combustions.\nThe Galaxy S8 will come in two sizes, both bigger than last year\u2019s models. Both models have screens that curve around the edges and get rid of the physical home button.\nThe Note 7 recall cost Samsung at least US$5.3 billion. Though many customers remain loyal, any further misstep could prove fatal for the brand.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of earning back that trust,\u201d said Drew Blackard, a senior director of product marketing for Samsung. In Canada and the U.S., Samsung will start taking pre-orders Thursday, with shipments scheduled for April 21. In Canada, the phones will be available in black and grey. Prices haven\u2019t been announced yet.\nABOUT THAT BATTERY\nSamsung has blamed the Note 7 fires on multiple design and manufacturing defects in its batteries. Inspectors concluded that the initial batteries were too small for their capacity, and that their external pouch put pressure on the internal structure, leading to damage and overheating.\nSamsung recalled the phones and shipped replacements, but the newer batteries had welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Samsung recalled the replacements, too, and scrapped the phone.\nThe company says phones will now go through multiple inspections, including X-rays and stress tests at extreme temperatures. The standard-size S8 phone has as much battery capacity as last year\u2019s Galaxy S7, but the phone is 4% larger by volume. The larger S8 Plus model has 3% less capacity than the Galaxy S7 Edge and the same capacity as the Note 7, but the phone\u2019s volume is larger by 12% and 6%, respectively.\nBoth models have larger displays, meaning more drain on the battery. Samsung says that software and processor efficiencies will let the new phones offer all-day battery life under normal use.\nBIGGER, WIDER SCREENS\nThe S8 phone\u2019s display measures 5.8 inches diagonally, compared with 5.1 inches on the S7. The S8 Plus will be 6.2 inches, compared with S7 Edge\u2019s 5.5 inches and the Note 7\u2019s 5.7 inches. Both S8 models are taller than their predecessors, but widths are roughly the same to preserve one-handed use.\nSamsung is getting rid of the \u201cEdge\u201d distinction and bringing curved sides to all S8 phones. It\u2019s also minimizing the frame, or bezel, surrounding the display; gone is a horizontal strip with the home button at the bottom. Instead, Samsung is embedding a virtual home button in the display, leaving Apple\u2019s iPhones as among the few to sport a distinct home button.\nVOICE ASSISTANT\nSamsung claims its new voice assistant, Bixby, will do much more than rivals from Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. For one thing, Samsung says Bixby will be able to handle any smartphone task currently managed by touch. Bixby will also offer information on books, wine and other products scanned with the phone\u2019s camera.\nBut there\u2019s a major caveat: Bixby will work only with selected Samsung apps, including the photo gallery and messages. Not all touch commands will have voice counterparts right away. Other apps will be able to adopt Bixby, but Samsung has had a mixed track record in getting other companies to support its home-brewed functions like Bixby.\n\u201cI think the brand will struggle to compete in the longer term with the broader digital ecosystems from Google, Amazon or Apple,\u201d Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said.\nOTHER FEATURES\nThe front camera is getting a boost to 8 megapixels, from 5 megapixels, while the rear one stays at 12 megapixels.\nAs with previous models, the S8 is water and dust resistant and features a memory card slot to supplement 64 gigabytes of built-in storage. The S8 will get an iris scanner to let people unlock the phone by looking at it ; the feature was new in the ditched Note 7 phone.\nSamsung will include premium earbuds from AKG, a brand it acquired when it bought Harman International.\nBEYOND THE S8\nSamsung\u2019s virtual-reality camera, Gear 360, will now accommodate a higher resolution, known as 4K, and work with iPhones, not just Samsung phones.\nAn optional docking station will turn the S8 phone into a desktop computer when connected to a regular TV. In that mode, people will be able to resize windows and work with several apps at once. It\u2019s similar to what Microsoft offers on its Windows 10 phones. Samsung also unveiled a router that doubles as a hub for internet-connected appliances and lights.\nSamsung said its previously announced Gear VR headset upgrade, which will now include a hand-held controller, will go on sale in April for about $130. Existing owners can buy just the controller for about $40. The company hasn\u2019t announced prices and release dates for the other accessories.\n\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-29T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "RIAA: Highest artist rates come from Apple Music as music industry slowly rebounds", "content": "RIAA: Highest artist rates come from Apple Music as music industry slowly rebounds\nReddit\nThe Recording Industry Association of America is out today with an overview of the performance\u00a0of the music industry during 2016. As detailed in a blog post , the music industry saw revenue of $7.7 billion during 2016, up 11.4 percent compared to the year before.\nPerhaps most notably, the report states that streaming music revenue from Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and YouTube made up the majority of that revenue for the first time ever.\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\nThe RIAA data\u00a0shows that streaming music services accounted for 51.4 percent of revenue during 2016. This marks the first time that streaming services have accounted for the majority of revenue in the music industry. More specifically, streaming services brought in $3.6 billion in revenue, up 68 percent year-over-year.\n2016 overall represented a strong year for the music industry. Showing 11.4 percent growth year-over-year, the music industry saw the biggest increase in revenue since 1998 when CDs were the primary source of revenue. At that time, six times more CDs were sold than today.\nIn the grand scheme of things, however, the music industry is still significantly smaller than it once was. The RIAA notes that revenues are half of what they were in 1999, during the CD-driven era.\nAlthough our 2016 revenue report catalogues substantial overall improvement for the industry, revenues are still only about half what they were in 1999, and revenues from more traditional unit-based sales (physical products and digital downloads) continued to decline significantly.\nThe latest RIAA report shares positive news as far as Apple is concerned. In terms of payments to music creators per 1,000 streams, Apple comes out well ahead of Spotify and YouTube. Apple pays between $12 and $15 per 1,000 streams, whereas Spotify pays around $7 per 1,000 streams, and YouTube pays around $1. The RIAA notes that what\u2019s really hindering the music industry from growth is the low payouts from services like YouTube, which uses a \u201clegal loophole\u201d to pay such a low rate:\nThe unfortunate reality is that we have achieved this modest success in spiteof our current music licensing and copyright laws, not because of them. That\u2019s not the way it should be. For example, it makes no sense that it takes a thousand on-demand streams of a song for creators to earn $1 on YouTube, while services like Apple and Spotify pay creators $7 or more for those same streams.\nWhy does this happen? Because a platform like YouTube wrongly exploits legal loopholes to pay creators at rates well below the true value of music while other digital services \u2014 including many new and small innovators \u2014 cannot.\nThe latest RIAA report\u00a0comes after a separate analytics firm claimed that\u00a0Apple Music has by far the largest user base thanks to the three-month free trial. Coupled with the RIAA report, Apple Music increasingly looks like the best option for artists when it comes to streaming music services.\nThe full RIAA report is available here .\nGuides\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-30T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Your next smartphone is not going to be a revolution", "content": "Brian Heater @bheater / 2 years\nSamsung promised a revolution today. The company opened today\u2019s Unpacked event by contextualizing the history of mobile phones, from the 1980s to today. The conceit was simple: Today\u2019s big announcement marks a step in cell phone evolution akin to the jump from the Zack Morris brick to the flip phone or the clamshell to the smartphone.\nWhat it delivered was a phone with fewer bezels.\nMaybe that\u2019s a bit unfair. The Galaxy S8 \u00a0looks like a great new flagship and a return to form for the company. It\u2019s got a lovely design and some cool features. It\u2019s a great culmination of the hardware and design work the company has been perfecting over the past few generations, coupled with new features like Bixby that lay the groundwork for upcoming devices. It\u2019s pretty much exactly what a company should shoot for in a flagship. And yet Samsung somehow managed to oversell it in the process.\nAfter a brief mention of the \u201ctough\u201d year the company had experienced (a theme it would briefly return to a few more times over the course of the one hour-plus event), DJ Koh, the company\u2019s head of mobile, told the audience at Lincoln Center, \u201cToday we are here to celebrate a milestone. Not just the launch of a great device, but the beginning of a new way to experience the world. A world where boxes no longer define us and barriers that once stood in the way have been removed.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the sort of statement you make before unveiling the printing press or the cotton gin \u2014 not a handset with some added screen real estate. Granted, Samsung has been extremely vigilante in its ongoing war against the bezel. The company has taken great strides to eliminate the scourge from the face of the earth, and the S8 and S8+ go even further than the edge line before them\u2026 but to cast the phone as the next major turning point in the advancement of mobile communication ultimately does a disservice.\nMuch of today\u2019s presentation revolved around the notion of \u201cunboxing[ing] your phone,\u201d a simultaneous play on the company\u2019s \u201cUnpacked\u201d events and a nod to the aforementioned removal of barriers that will be great if you pony up the cash for a new Samsung flagship. Of course, tech companies have never been great at tempering expectations, and Samsung, much like Apple, has built its image around the notion that every subsequent product will be the one that truly changes its users\u2019 lives once and for all.\nIf there\u2019s a box Samsung was breaking out of here, it was the tone of penance that defined its last few big events, each of which opened on a somber note and a promise to do better. Today, however, it felt as though the company had finally shaken off those shackles for good in an act of redemption that wouldn\u2019t come from investigations or newly implemented safety regulations, but from the first major new phone it\u2019s released since the whole Note 7 kerfuffle went down. Now that eight-point safety check isn\u2019t a defense or a response \u2014 it\u2019s yet another in a long line of features the company can boast of adding to its new handset alongside a bigger screen and in-house smart assistant.\nA rep I spoke with ahead of the event summed up the notion nicely, stating, \u201cSome of the key learning takeaways are that as much as we innovate for products and services, we need to do that on safety as well.\u201d\nToday\u2019s event marked a remarkable shift that the company hinted at during its CES press event when it floated the notion of \u201cReach[ing] Higher\u201d in conjunction with both the (then ongoing) Note investigations and its new line of connected appliances.\nSamsung may well have overplayed its hand here both as a result of that newfound freedom and the broader notion among tech pundits that there was a heck of a lot more than just the success of a new phone hinging on today\u2019s announcement. Today was regarded by many as the company\u2019s first big chance to right the ship following an ongoing apology tour, and the company seemingly decided that nothing short of a total smartphone revolution would do.\nSamsung was right in its assessment today that the smartphone industry has been somewhat stagnant since the original breakthrough of touchscreen devices. There\u2019s been plenty of innovation in the past decade, sure, but aside from some key software breakthroughs like the advent of wide-scale third-party support through app stores, innovation has been gradual in a fast-paced environment.\nThe company perhaps hasn\u2019t helped its case by showing far-off technologies like flexible and foldable displays over the years \u2014 concepts that showcase how far we still have left to go before making the next major breakthrough in the mobile computing form factor. And certainly the tech media has played its part in stoking that fire.\nSo let\u2019s be perfectly clear: The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a nice phone, but it\u2019s not a smartphone revolution. And whatever your next smartphone happens to be almost certainly won\u2019t be one either. Surely the next great step looms somewhere not too far over the horizon, but we\u2019re certainly not there yet.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-29T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Markets Live: ASX's best week of 2017", "content": "Advertisement\n4.04pm on Mar 31, 2017\nToday's suite of macroprudential measures by the banking regulator is too little to cool the housing market, says TD's Annette Beacher, sticking with her call that the RBA will lift rates in November.\nBeacher is the only economist in Bloomberg's monthly survey to tip the central bank will tighten this year, mainly because of financial stability worries sparked by surging house prices. Outside the survey, Goldman Sachs is another bank that is predicting a rate hike in November.\n\"A cap on interest-only loans does not ease the pressure on house prices and debt levels in our view, and so we leave our +25bp in November in place,\" Beacher said.\nIn Bloomberg's most recent survey, published today, all 26 economists expect the RBA to remain on hold when the board meets on Tuesday.\nMost economists also predict the central bank will keep the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent for the rest of the year, but a sizeable minority of eight economists say the RBA will cut rates at least one more time in 2017.\n3.44pm on Mar 31, 2017\nThe ASX is in a sweet spot, but it can't last, writes one of your Eds:\nA little over a week ago the worst session for the ASX since the US election had investors wondering about whether the Trump trade was dead. Since then, the sharemarket has come back bigger and stronger.\nA big part of the story is the banks. Investors are betting that higher mortgage rates will translate into stronger bank profits. Since the March 22 slump, banks are 5 per cent higher.\nBut sharp moves in the ASX need new money, and it's highly likely that it's coming from overseas\nBut why the interest from beyond our borders?\nThe first hint is in the bond market.\n\"The excitement that was caused by the failure of President Trump's healthcare bill has been washed away as bond yields stabilise,\" Societe Generale currency strategist Kit Juckes says.\nAfter threatening to break beyond 2.6 per cent in recent weeks, US bond yields now hover around 2.42 per cent, a level which \"is neither too hot nor too cold,\" Juckes says.\nIn similar fashion, after pushing towards 3 per cent in early March, Aussie bond yields have retreated sharply to 2.7 per cent.\n\"Bond yields are \"consistent with a couple more [US] rate hikes this year but not with the Fed's famous dots that take rates to 3 per cent in due course,\" Juckes says. A couple more rate hikes chimes with continued pick-up in US growth, even as the global economic recovery stays on track.\n\"That's a recipe for yield-hungry, risk-tolerant investors to take the lead,\" Juckes says.\nThat is also a recipe for ASX outperformance. The S&P 500 index is only up by 1 per cent since its nasty fall on March 21; ours 3.7 per cent.\nFalling yields and ongoing faith in the global reflationary trend: this is our market's sweet spot. No wonder offshore investors want a piece of it.\nBut there is an obvious tension between these two trades. Eventually higher inflation has to lead to higher yields, reducing the ASX's dividend-heavy appeal. Or else growth falters and exposed, commodity-exposed markets like Australia get hit. Either way, nothing about the current situation is sustainable over the longer term.\nIt's not that our market can't push higher beyond 6000 points in the coming weeks and months, but we are unlikely to get this unusual, if happy, marriage of lower rates and firming global economic growth. If I had to bet on one, it would be on the latter. Rates are more likely to go higher than lower. And if that is matched with improving activity and earnings, then equities still look attractive.\nThe twin drivers of the recent ASX rally can't live together for long.\nCredit:AP\nAdvertisement\n2.25pm on Mar 31, 2017\nPrivate sector credit came in below market expectations for the second consecutive month in February, but investor lending remained brisk.\nTotal credit rose just 0.3 per cent in February, while housing related credit ticked up to 0.6 per cent, broadly in line with the average run-rate of the past year.\nInvestor lending once again rose 0.6 per cent, while owner-occupier credits grew at 0.5 per cent. In annual terms, investor credit is currently growing at 6.7 per cent, compared with 6.2 per cent for owner-occupiers.\nThe story of the past six months has been the ramp-up in investor housing credit towards the APRA-imposed 10 per cent annual speed limit, and this trend was maintained in February, says JPMorgan economist Henry St John.\nOver the past month, the big four banks have sequentially upped rates on new investor mortgages by ~25bp. Today, APRA announced a fresh set of macroprudential regulations, aimed at restricting interest-only mortgages to 30 per cent of new loan growth.\n\"In the absence of data breaking down the proportion of interest-only mortgages taken out by investors, it is difficult to surmise the direct impact on investor credit growth. However, the bank mortgage re-pricing should begin to act as a headwind to investor credit growth as we head into mid-2017,\" St John says.\nOutside of housing, business credit surprisingly contracted by 0.1 per cent for the second consecutive month, which takes the annual run rate for business credit to 3.7 per cent, the lowest level since August 2014.\nThis will disappoint the RBA, which is hoping for a pick-up in business confidence and borrowing, St John says.\n\"Continued sluggish growth in business credit poses a risk to Australian growth outcomes, particularly at a time where real residential investment is in the process of cooling.\"\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-31T05:34:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "ALEX BRUMMER: Credit Suisse under siege", "content": "comments\nHard times: Credit Suisse boss\u00a0Tidjane Thiam\u00a0faces probes by tax enforcers\nAs far as we know, the 17 British banks implicated in the Laundromat Russian money-laundering scandal have escaped the attention of the British authorities even though there could be a big pay day for HMRC and the exchequer.\nCredit Suisse is not so lucky. The Swiss banks, including the Geneva branch of HSBC, have a long history of hiding dodgy money from prying eyes.\nThere was an assumption that the game was up with the dump of the Panama Papers and the settlement reached between the Swiss banks and the American government over the sheltering of US tax avoiders, for which Credit Suisse paid a $2.6billion fine.\nAs if Credit Suisse's high-profile chief executive Tidjane Thiam didn't have enough problems on his hands, his bank faces probes by tax enforcers across Europe.\nDutch prosecutors seized jewellery, paintings and gold ingots from Credit Suisse branches as part of what was described as a money-laundering probe.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nShare this article\nShare\nOne of the curiosities of this is that prosecutors and tax authorities from London to Sydney look to be in the investigation, but Switzerland seems to have been out of the loop with the attorney-general's office indignant at its omission.\u00a0\nThe implication is that the tax authorities in Britain, France and the Netherlands don't quite trust them to police their banks as thoroughly as expected, post crisis.\nThe reputational damage to Credit Suisse will be considerable. Under Thiam's guidance, the bank raised some \u00a34billion from investors in 2015 to strengthen capital and made much of its goal of being one of the world's top wealth managers with an eye on Asia. Re-establishing trust will be a big ask.\nCutting loose\nJolly good that Philip Hammond has managed to boost Treasury coffers by \u00a311.8billion through selling a chunk of the Bradford & Bingley buy-to-let loans acquired during the financial crisis.\u00a0\nBuyers Blackstone and Prudential have provided assurances that mortgage borrowers will face no change of conditions.\nNevertheless, it is odd that the Government is being shy in describing how much cash will be coming from which prospective owner and how the booty has been divided.\u00a0\nThe Treasury hides under the rubric of commercial secrecy, even though with the large number of potential buyers there can be very little that remains unknown in the City.\nThe deal by no means gets the Government fully off the B&B hook. More sales will be required before the Treasury fully clears the \u00a315.6billion debt to the Financial Services Compensation Authority taken on by Gordon Brown at the time of B&B's collapse.\nAll of this is a mere bagatelle when compared to the Government's still moribund 71.3 per cent holding in RBS. When it starts shifting that, there may be a case for the taxpayer to begin forgiving the bankers.\nDoubling down\nSelling the \u00a311billion zero premium merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management to shareholders is proving an uphill struggle.\u00a0\nTerrible twins Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch, who aim to be joint chief executives, are being given a torrid time by media, analysts and investors alike.\u00a0\nIndeed, in presentations the protagonists have taken to pointing to the US examples of Apple, Whole Foods and Microsoft as cases where such a set-up has worked.\nMaybe, but they are not exactly parallels to the world of savings.\nWhere the merger does seem to make some sense is that it does create a credible scale player in asset management, which is increasingly divided between big beasts and boutiques. But for this to work, it is going to require ruthless cost-cutting \u2013 and neither side seems willing to face up to that.\nOne also needs to buy into a narrative that says low-cost passive management has passed its peak and active investing, especially in high-saving Asia, is the go-to model.\nIts huge rival Blackrock clearly differs, following its decision to replace people with computer code.\nDiplomatic coup\nWhich is the fastest-growing big confectionery company in the world? As Mars, Hershey, Nestle and Cadbury-owner Mondelez struggle to grow, racing ahead is Italy's privately owned Ferrero (now the owner of Thorntons).\nThe company is marking its maturity by family scion Giovanni Ferrero choosing an outside chief executive, Lapo Civiletti, as his successor.

{"title": "These States Are Pushing Back Against The Internet Privacy Rollback", "content": "These States Are Pushing Back Against The Internet Privacy Rollback\nBy Mark Sullivan\n2 minute Read\nWhen it comes to immigration rights to civil liberties, several states are vowing to chart their own course \u2014through legislation or in the courts\u2014against what they consider the harsh agenda of the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress. The latest battleground is over Obama-era broadband privacy restrictions on internet service providers, which Congress voted to overturn this week. States across the country are stepping in to make sure that such protections are not completely discarded.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nMinnesota\u2019s state house voted Friday to require ISPs to provide an opt-out opportunity to subscribers before collecting and selling their information. Democratic Senator Ron Latz managed to add the amendment \u00a0to an economic development budget bill and, despite a GOP attempt to remove it, the body\u00a0OK\u2019d the amendment 66-1. The overall budget bill passed 58-9.\nThe surprise move comes just after the House of Representatives in Washington D.C., followed the Senate in repealing FCC rules that also require ISPs to give subscribers a chance to opt out of having their personal data collected and sold. The rules were slated to take effect later this year. The president is almost certain to sign the resolution, which would formally remove the privacy rules and prevent the FCC from enacting similar ones in the future.\nDemocrats in the Illinois state house are considering their own set of privacy protections for internet users , reports the AP. An Illinois House of Representatives committee has now considered two new online privacy measures, with more discussion on the legislation set for\u00a0next week.\nOne bill guarantees consumers the right to know what information internet companies like Facebook and Google have collected on them, and to what third parties the information has been sold. California added similar language to the law back in 2005.\nThe other bill guarantees that internet companies can\u2019t track the physical location of mobile users without asking for permission. California proposed an amendment to more narrowly define the definition of geotracking, but the measure died in the Senate during 2016.\n\u201cPeople are looking to us now to provide protections for consumers,\u201d state representative Arthur Turner (D-Chicago) told the Associated Press. Turner proposed the \u201cright-to-know\u201d bill.\nadvertisement\nBusiness groups oppose the bill, saying it classifies too much user data as \u201csensitive,\u201d putting an undue burden on businesses that must collect some user information.\nThe\u00a0big internet companies are present in the debate, too. Illinois senator Michael Hastings , who proposed a Senate companion to the Assembly\u2019s right-to-know bill, told the AP that lobbyists representing Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft have already visited his office to discuss the legislation. \u00a0\nHastings doesn\u2019t sound like he was swayed by the lobbyists\u2019 arguments about the value of collecting consumer data. \u201cIt may be good for the Apples, the Amazons of the world, but it\u2019s not good for people,\u201d Hastings said.\nIf and when Trump signs the resolution rolling back the FCC broadband protections, we may see more state houses jump into action with their own bills.\nadvertisement\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-31T21:00:09Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Apple iPad 5: iFixit reveals the secrets to the tablet's low price", "content": "Apple iPad 5: iFixit reveals the secrets to the tablet's low price\ntech2 News Staff Mar 31, 2017 12:56:46 IST\nThe new Apple iPad (The iPad 5?) was launched with little fanfare and a massive price drop. Apple dropped the price of the device by a third, upgraded the processor to an A9, added Touch ID and promised a brighter screen. How did it manage all of this?\nWell, as it turns out, the most obvious answer is the correct one. Apple simply built a cheaper iPad from cheaper materials.\nTeardown expert iFixit recently applied their skills to the new iPad. They ripped the device apart and separated it into its core components. Their discoveries reveal a lot about the iPad\u2019s low price. The new iPad sells for around $329 (around Rs 21,000). The iPad Air 2 was priced at $499 (around Rs 32,500).\nOne of these is a 2013 iPad Air and the other a 2017 iPad. Can you tell which is which?\nImage: iFixit\nThe first thing that iFixit noted was that the new iPad is actually very similar to the 2013 iPad Air, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so cheap. Now we know that Apple doesn\u2019t change the design of its products very often and the iPad Air and iPad Air 2 do look very similar.\nThe secret to the price is the design of the display unit on both devices. On the original iPad Air, the display wasn\u2019t laminated. This results in a display unit that\u2019s easier to repair and cheaper to manufacture. The display will also appear to be slightly brighter.\nIn a laminated display , as on the iPad Air 2, the brightness is slightly lower and the display unit is more expensive to make. It is slimmer, however, which is why the new iPad is actually thicker than the iPad that it replaces.\nAnother difference is that the iPad Air 2\u2019s display has an anti-reflective coating; the new iPad doesn\u2019t have one.\niFixit also discovered that the internal layout and configuration of components in the new iPad is very similar to that of the iPad Air. In fact, it\u2019s possible to swap the new iPad\u2019s display with that of the iPad Air.\nThe cheaper display coupled with the fact that the iPad\u2019s components are cheaper to manufacture have contributed to the new iPad\u2019s low price.\nSome have speculated that Apple lowered the quality and price of the iPad in order to compete with Google, which has seriously threatened Apple\u2019s dominion over the education market by offering Chromebook\u2019s at rock-bottom prices.\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

{"title": "Samsung reboots its smart home, IoT strategy with the Galaxy S8", "content": "Internet of Things\nSamsung reboots its smart home, IoT strategy with the Galaxy S8\nWith the S8 smartphones and other new products, Samsung launches a grand plan to build smart homes of the future\nEmail a friend\nUse commas to separate multiple email addresses\nFrom\nYour message has been sent.\nSorry\n| Mar 30, 2017 12:46 PM PT\nAdam Patrick Murray\nCurrent Job Listings\nSamsung has a portfolio of devices and appliances that would make Apple envious. But unlike Apple, Samsung devices don't work well together.\nWith the Galaxy S8 smartphones and other new products, Samsung hopes that will change. The company is setting in motion a grand plan to build smart homes where its devices operate seamlessly and provide a consistent user experience.\nSamsung's S8 smartphones will be able to activate appliances through Connect, an app based on the company's SmartThings platform. With just a flick of the finger, the app will allow users to start a robot vacuum cleaner, dim lights, or even ask a Family Hub \u00a0refrigerator to analyze contents and send a supermarket shopping list.\n[ Also see Wi-Fi 6 is coming to a router near you . | Get regularly scheduled insights by signing up for Network World newsletters . ]\nThe S8 also features a new artificial intelligence service called Bixby, which will ultimately allow users to tell the Connect app to activate a device. Samsung plans to integrate Bixby into appliances and devices for voice-activated operation, said Werner Goertz, research director at Gartner.\nSamsung also introduced the Connect Home router, which integrates the SmartThings hub. The router can be used as a central device to control SmartThings devices sold by Samsung and other companies.\nAfter much foot dragging, Samsung is finally pushing its consumer IoT strategy forward, with SmartThings the glue that brings all devices together. Samsung acquired SmartThings in 2014, but it took almost three years for the company to make it a useful asset.\nThat's partly because Samsung has been a somewhat dysfunctional organization in which divisions often compete with each other instead of cooperating. The competing divisions are now working together with the hope of providing a consistent device experience, something that has made Apple successful.\nSamsung still hasn't shown anything related to its recent acquisition, Viv, which has developed a full-blown AI service. Either Samsung is fumbling with Viv, like it did with SmartThings, or internal dysfunction is delaying its implementation in mobile devices, analysts said.\nBixby has some cool features, but it still lags behind Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana.\u00a0Bixby is a voice agent for smartphones to run tasks and is also capable of recognizing images, providing recommendations, and translating languages.\nSamsung this week showed Bixby on S8 recognizing the Flatiron building\u00a0and then providing recommendations on places to eat nearby. Additionally, the service can recognize objects\u00a0and then redirect users to sites where people can buy or see reviews of items. But the demonstrations were carried out under controlled conditions.\nBut there are issues that Samsung needs to work out. The S8 handsets have Google's more advanced artificial intelligence technology, which could hurt Bixby's adoption.\nThe S8 remains \"first and foremost a Google ecosystem device,\" and Bixby is trying to provide a different type of service, said Richard Windsor, an\u00a0analyst at Edison Investment Research, in a research note.\n\"But careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,\" Windsor said. It also works with few apps, limiting its utility.\nBixby also lacks advanced analytics that could help with home automation. For some reason, Samsung has chosen a limited implementation of SmartThings, which is already capable of home automation. For example, SmartThings can analyze data gathered over time to automatically switch air conditioners on or off, or turn on a light or heating when a car is close to home. The service can also provide diet recommendations based on health data gathered over time. Advanced features of SmartThings will be available in the future, a Samsung spokesman said.\nAdvanced features of SmartThings will be available in the future, a Samsung spokesman said.\nAt an analyst event on Thursday, Samsung showed Gartner's Goertz a pyramid-like graphic which showed IoT and intelligence as a middleware foundation for a group of products.\n\"Going forward, we should expect the currently siloed groups and technologies to leverage this common platform and maybe that way, bridge the silos and create much-needed synergies,\" Goertz said.\nBut the IoT data platform is still nascent, and Bixby lacks advanced AI features. Viv could bring advanced analytics to Bixby over time, but Samsung hasn't rolled the service out.\nSamsung also has a full-blown cloud service called Artik, but it is offered by the company's semiconductor unit, which operates almost like a separate company. SmartThings can work with the Artik Cloud\u00a0and open up to a wider range of smart home devices. However, Artik is more of a cloud-based analytics play, much like Microsoft's Azure.\nJoin the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.\nRelated:\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-30T17:46:00Z", "images": []}

There are two interesting things about this ad.\nIt\u2019s a colorful, cheerful clip that wants to turn the Apple Watch into a pop culture symbol. And it focuses on the fitness features of the Apple Watch, proving that Apple thinks about the device as an activity tracking device first and foremost.\nApple chose Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFreedom\u201d as the soundtrack. The ad shows many different Apple Watch users practicing their favorite sport in a world dominated by a single, bright color.\nReal life doesn\u2019t really look like that, but I\u2019ve got to say that it was a bit more convincing than a boring description of different practical Apple Watch use cases.\nA couple of shots show Apple\u2019s quirky 3D emojis and the Apple Watch\u2019s meditation feature .

He came up with the spin-wheel interface for iPods, led the digital music revolution with iPod and iTunes, and helped reinvent mobile phones with the iPhone and the App Store . Schiller, who reports now to CEO Tim Cook , was in Bengaluru on Friday \u2013 his first trip to India \u2013 for the launch of the company\u2019s App Accelerator , a platform that will support iOS developers on design, quality and performance of their apps. The accelerator will assist developers to build apps using its programming language Swift that was created for iOS, Apple TV and Apple Watch. In an interview with TOI, Schiller talks about how they want to offer the best for Indian customers and developers.\nWhen did India show up on Apple\u2019s radar?\nHard to say to a day. Over the last few years, it\u2019s grown dramatically in importance to us. This is a very exciting change, we see the opportunity for a huge market and a very young population and we want to be important here. We want to make products that this market loves. Our driving ambition in every market is to be the best, and not the cheapest, with whatever that means to customers. In India, we want to be the best provider of the things we do. We have started asking ourselves what it means to be the best in India \u2013 how is it like other markets and how is it different. Distribution can be different, network infrastructure is different.\nHow are you tapping into India\u2019s vibrant developer base?\nWe have a large base of developers here in India. The software talent is remarkable and the entrepreneurial spirt is second to none. Our rough estimate is just under half a million registered developers and if you include the extended number of people that are working with them on their apps, that should be somewhere around three quarters of a million people in the iOS app economy. We want to help them be more successful in the local market and there is a great opportunity for developers in India through our App Store to reach to the world. We want to use things that Apple is good at to assist these developers, like user interface design, we also want to give them our knowledge of the latest tech, the new frameworks and the new APIs.\nApple has somewhat had a love-hate relationship with developers globally. Have you reduced the friction points since you started running developer relations?\nI would always like to think that we have a love-love relationship. But we have certainly had to get better as to how we run the business and listen to developers. And over the last year and a half, we have put a concerted effort to say that our App Store has been open for 8-9 years and so much growth is in front of us. And developers tell us that our effort has been showing. They have seen it in our review times, in the business models that we are opening up with subscriptions.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-01T02:38:14Z", "images": []}

Now it seems that if the predictions of investment bank Barclays were to come true, Apple\u2019s 2017 iPhones are expected to come with the display technology .\nFor those who are unfamiliar with True Tone displays, these could in a way be thought of as a more advanced version of Night Shift, which basically makes displays warmer and eliminates blue light which is said to mess with a person\u2019s sleep cycle. With True Tone, it goes beyond that as thanks to the use of sensors, it will be able to detect the light temperature around it and adjust the display\u2019s color and intensity to match its surroundings.\nThis means that in theory, the display should always be giving users the best look possible regardless of where they are. However like we said, so far the technology has only made its way into the 9.7-inch iPad Pro as even the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro does not have the feature, so Apple\u2019s iPhones could beat it to the punch.\nThe report from the bank claims that all of Apple\u2019s 2017 models will sport the new feature, as opposed to being limited to a particular model, like the rumored iPhone Edition. Take it with a grain of salt for now, but it is a piece of tech that we would not mind seeing in the iPhone.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-17T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Jennifer Jolly Special for USA Today\nIt's OK to let your phone run down to zero battery once in a while.\n(Photo: Blackzheep, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE\nThe battery tech that powers most of our smartphones hasn\u2019t changed much in the past few decades, but common knowledge about how to keep them in tip-top shape? That\u2019s even worse.\nHere are the top five most common smartphone battery-life myths that need to die\u00a0if you want to prolong your phone's overall lifespan, straight from the world\u2019s leading battery experts.\nMyth #1 Smartphone batteries are made to last forever.\nFact: The lithium-ion batteries found in most smartphones today are expected to maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for around 300 to 500 full charge cycles. That\u2019s a pretty wide range. For me, a heavy user and charger, that means I get about one good year before my battery starts to poop out. For most other people, the average is about two years it shows significant signs of wear and tear.\n\u201cThey\u2019re made with built-in obsolescence,\u201d says Isidor Buchmann , CEO of Cadex Electronics and educational website Battery University. \u201cThe battery doesn\u2019t die overnight, but they all fade without most people even knowing that it\u2019s happening.\u201d\nApple has a few web pages dedicated to this very topic and explains it this way, \u201cwith lithium-ion batteries, the capacity diminishes slightly with each complete charge cycle.\u201d But on the same Apple site, it also says that you can \u201ccharge your Apple lithium-ion battery whenever you want,\u201d which gets confusing if misunderstood and leads us straight to myth #2.\nMyth #2: It doesn\u2019t matter when or how long your charge your smartphone battery.\nFact: If you don\u2019t use your smartphone much, or upgrade every time a new model comes out, charge it whenever and however you want. But if you want it to be at it\u2019s best the longest, \u201cnever run a battery to zero. That\u2019s bad for it,\u201d says Carl Howe former mobile analyst and Principal of Think Big Analytics. \u201cThe rule of thumb: To get your smartphone battery to last the longest, charge it to 80% and recharge it when it hits 20% to avoid stressing the system.\u201d\nI think of it like snacking. Eating smaller portions several times a day is better than starving and overstuffing. Chronically letting a battery go all the way down to zero puts unneeded stress on the materials inside. Believe it or not, the same goes for letting it sit on your charger overnight, because being continually juiced up quickly \u2014 and to the max also leads lithium-ion batteries to corrode faster than they otherwise would.\nThere isn\u2019t any perfect solution, but all five of the experts we spoke with agreed, the sweet spot for smartphone batteries is indeed between 20% and 80%, and if you can keep it in or near those limits more often than not, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a battery that lasts in the long run.\nMyth #3: It\u2019s terrible to let your phone die.\nA warning many smartphone users are familiar with.\n\u00a0(Photo: Jennifer Jolly for USA TODAY)\nFact: We just told you not to make it a daily habit, but if you want your battery to stretch its legs a bit every now and again, it\u2019s okay to let it run a \u201cfull charge cycle,\u201d or to let it die and then charge back up to 100% again. This helps the little computers that control the battery remember where its high and low points are, and will give you a more accurate reading of your charge.\n\u201cMy personal best practice is to let it drain completely every one-to-three months\u201d says Stewart Tomassian , with gadget set-up service Enjoy in San Francisco. \u201call the way up and all the way dead, and then all the way back up again.\u201d It\u2019s not a must-do, and it will impact overall lifespan of the battery, but it can help keep your smartphone\u2019s power gauges working as they should, and displaying the most up-to-date information possible.\nMyth #4: All chargers are basically the same.\nFact: When it comes to charging, you really shouldn\u2019t skimp on cords and adapters. When a company like Apple or Samsung makes a phone, they make their chargers to work in harmony with it. Reputable third party chargers are fine, but that cheap-o do-it-all charger you got from the gas station might not be. Poorly-made chargers might provide too little or \u2014 and this is the scary one \u2014 too much power for your gadget to handle.\nToo little juice and your phone charges super slowly, but too much and the battery has the potential to overheat, even to the point of failure. Spend the extra dollar or two and pick up officially approved chargers for your smartphone, and you\u2019ll be much better off.\nMyth #5: If your battery\u2019s dying, you have too many apps running.\nFact: I love closing all my apps with a simple double tap and finger swipe up. It\u2019s like cleaning house, but only takes a few seconds, and you have this seemingly clean slate to work from. It\u2019s so darn satisfying, and yet so silly to do if you want your battery to stay alive.\nCertified Apple Consultant and former Apple Genius, Scotty Loveless explains, \u201cyes, it does shut down the app, but what you don\u2019t know is that you are actually making your battery life worse if you do this on a regular basis.\u201d By closing the app, you also take if off the phones short-term memory list. So the next time you need it, it has to load it back up again from scratch. \u201cAll of that loading and unloading puts more stress on your device than just leaving it alone.\u201d Loveless says.\nLess befuddled about batteries?\nOf course, there are exceptions to every rule and I look forward to comments and insights from battery-wise readers who can add to all of this. We also asked our handful of experts how to figure out, once and for all, what\u2019s making your battery die so dang fast on a daily basis.

It's coming to the iPhone.\nHere's the thing: this information comes from a research note from investment bank Barclays, as reported by MacRumors . These types of research notes, including notes from analysts like\u00a0 KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo , often correctly predict future product features.\nApple\u2019s True Tone display is only available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It works a lot like the white-balance-compensating system found in the iPhone's camera flash, allowing the iPad's screen to determine the right percentage and intensity of white light needed. Whites tend to look different under different light, but with True Tone, the iPad can shift how its display looks no matter the lighting condition.\nHow to turn on Apple's Night Shift mode and adjust the colour on Macs\nIn other words, True Tone displays can adjust the appearance of the screen based on your environment. So, whether you're outside in sunlight or sitting in a dim basement, your display will adjust accordingly in order to be easy on the eyes. In fact, this feature is also similar to Night Shift, another iOS and MacOS feature designed to reduce the amount of blue light you see during the evening hours.\nBarclays claimed True Tone will be available on all three of Apple\u2019s next iPhones, which it\u2019s calling the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus, and iPhone 8.

{"title": "Who you work with matters more than your pay packet: happiness survey", "content": "Play video\nA new Curtin University analysis of national data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey also suggests you are more likely to be satisfied working for a small business instead of a larger company.\nReport author Associate Professor Rebecca Cassells from the Curtin Business School says the new study reveals that Australians who work for themselves or in small businesses, in the not-for-profit or government sector and workers that can do some of their work from home each week are more likely to be satisfied in their jobs.\nAdvertisement\nAssociate Professor Rebecca Cassells from the Curtin Business School.\nFormer Apple executive Diana Ryall is 70 and works as a career coach and mentor because she loves her job. The survey found people are more likely to work past the age of 70 for the same reason.\n\"I always thought at 70 that I would step back from work but ... the work I do is what I am passionate about,\" she says.\nThe study: Happy Workers: How Satisfied are Australians at Work? found people working for smaller firms have higher levels of job satisfaction that those at bigger companies.\n\"Big corporations can learn from smaller ones when it comes to having a happier workforce,\" Associate Professor Cassells said.\nDiana Ryall is 70 years old and is still working because she loves it.\nCredit:Tim Lumsdaine\nThe analysis of data from 17,000 people across the country, including 11,000 with jobs, found the major key to happiness was the job itself.\n\"We can see through our analysis it's the job itself and how you are able to go about your work and who you have beside you and management practices,\" Associate Professor Cassells said.\nRhonda Brighton-Hall, chief executive officer of the company and think-tank Making Work Absolutely Human, commissioned the report and said it showed \"it's what you do, how you are able to go about your work and who is alongside you that matters the most when it comes to job satisfaction\".\nOther key findings of the report include:\n- About 40 per cent of Australian workers report being 'very satisfied' with their job security and 36 per cent with their flexibility to balance work and non-work commitments.\n- Generations X and Y are more likely to report being dissatisfied in their job than other generations.\n- Higher levels of education levels do not necessarily result in greater satisfaction at work.\n- Women are more likely to be \"very satisfied\" in their job than men \u2013 31 per cent compared to 27 per cent.\n- Satisfaction with job flexibility and hours of work decrease rapidly beyond 38 hours per week.\n- 35 per cent of community and personal service workers report being very satisfied in their job overall, while 26 per cent of accommodation and food services workers report being dissatisfied.\n- A higher proportion of employees in the private sector report being dissatisfied with their job overall (20 per cent) compared to government (14 per cent) and not-for-profit (12 per cent) sector employees.\n- Australians who work for themselves or in micro-businesses are more likely to report being very satisfied with their job than those in big companies.\n- People who report being 'very satisfied' with their job overall earn a lower average amount each week than those that report being 'satisfied'.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-04T22:06:13Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple battle takes toll on Chinese giant Huawei", "content": "Apple battle takes toll on Chinese giant Huawei\nSaturday, April 01, 2017\nHuawei Technologies earnings have grown at their slowest pace in five years, as China\u2019s biggest maker of telecommunications gear sank money into research and a marketing blitz to gain ground on Apple and Samsung in smartphones.\nHuawei, founded by former army engineer Ren Zhengfei three decades ago, has emerged as one of China\u2019s most recognisable consumer brands. A relatively new entrant in mobile devices, it has rapidly grabbed market share from Apple and Samsung with premium phones and is now ranked third globally. However, that expansion comes at a cost, as the company boosts spending to keep up.\nIts main business of networking equipment is also slowing as phone carriers rein in network rollouts and prepare for the advent of faster 5G standards. And smartphone competition at home from the likes of Oppo is intensifying.\nNet income inched 0.4% higher to 37.1bn yuan (\u20ac5bn) in 2016, the company which is based in Shenzhen said yesterday. That was its slowest pace of growth since a profit decline in 2011.\nIts net margin dipped to 7.1% from about 9.3% the previous year. That level of profitability is \u201cappropriate,\u201d said Eric Xu, the current rotating chief executive.\nHuawei said it spent 14.6% of its 2016 revenue on research and development and will set aside $10bn (\u20ac9.3bn) to $20bn annually for that purpose as it ramps up research into everything from artificial intelligence and wireless technology to cloud computing. It has also begun keeping a closer eye on the bottom line.\nXu pledged in December to cut extravagant marketing events and warned against \u201cblind optimism and rhetoric.\u201d Mounting expenses would damage efficiency and profitability, he said in a memo to staff.\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying more attention to efficiency and scaling back on investments that cannot bring value,\u201dsaid Xu. Under the current rotation he will cede the helm this week.\nThe company blamed a rapidly expanding consumer business for weighing on margins. Revenue grew 32% to 521.6bn yuan, said Huawei, a closely held company that discloses only basic finances. That was a tad ahead of its own expectations. However, the consumer division outstripped that pace, increasing revenue 44% to 179.8bn yuan by shipping 139m smartphones in 2016.\nHuawei has become less dependent on its traditional networking business as the company attempts to grow sales from cloud computing and smartphones.\nAbout 56% of its sales came from the telecoms-carrier business last year, down from about 60% in 2015 and about two-thirds in 2014, according to previous reports.\nIt has declared its intention of becoming the world\u2019s largest smartphone player within half a decade and Huawei is said to be aiming for $33bn in 2017 revenue for its consumer electronics business, which include smartphones, tablets and wearables.\nHowever, that business is under assault at home. It lost its top position in China\u2019s smartphone market last year to Oppo Electronics, which attacked rural areas and lower-tier cities. And Vivo ranked just behind Huawei domestically in the December quarter, according to research firm IDC.\nWhile Huawei has voiced ambitions to expand abroad, it remains heavily reliant on its home market. China contributed 45% or 236.5bn yuan of revenue last year compared with 42% in 2015. A little over half of its smartphones were shipped within the domestic market in the quarter ended December, according to IDC.\nDeputy chairman Guo Ping will now become CEO. Guo started as a project manager at Huawei nearly 30 years ago and once headed the smartphone business.\nHuawei employs a unique rotating-CEO mechanism after Ren excused himself from daily operations more than five years ago.\nKen Hu, who used to lead information security and US businesses, is the other executive in the rotation.\nBloomberg\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-03-31T23:00:00Z", "images": []}

Facebook has been resisting the warrants ever since they were issued, and maintained that position even after the threat of criminal contempt forced it to start turning over account information.\nIt\u2019s not the first defeat The Social Network\u2122 has suffered in the case: its current appeal was trying to overturn a July 2015 ruling by the Manhattan state appeals court. Facebook had tried to argue that the warrants were too broad, and that they overstepped the mark by demanding it not tell users the warrants existed.\nThe court papers reveal that 62 Facebook users have already been indicted in the investigation.\nFacebook had high-profile support in resisting the warrants, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\nThe court declined to discuss whether the warrants were constitutionally valid, saying it\u2019s up to state legislators to change the law.\nThe one dissenting judge, Rowan Wilson, expressed concern that people swept up in the warrants included high school students accused of nothing worse than knowing people involved in the investigation. \u00ae\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-05T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "This rugged AR eyewear is similar to Google Glass but won't break", "content": "TechWorld\nThis rugged AR eyewear is similar to Google Glass but won't break\nOsterhout Design Group's R-7HL AR eyewear costs about $3,500 and is designed for enterprise use\nAgam Shah (IDG News Service) 05 April, 2017 01:00\n-\nComments\nWhile some people considered Google Glass eyewear simply cool or nosy, the devices were a gold mine of innovation for Pete Jameson.\nJameson, the chief operating officer at Osterhout Design Group, believes Google Glass spread awareness and spawned innovation in eyewear. ODG is among a few companies bringing forward new ideas to make smartglasses practical.\nODG's latest R-7HL is a pair of rugged augmented-reality smartglasses that protects eyes from projectiles. The glasses won't break easily and draw inspiration from Google Glass, augmented reality headsets, and rugged PCs.\nThe R-7HL is AR eyewear similar to the size of regular glasses, but it isn't meant to be worn all the time. The see-through glasses blend virtual 3D images on real-world backgrounds.\nThe R-7HL blends computer-generated images into a user's view, providing new ways to interact with the world around. It's a highlighted feature of much larger headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens.\nODG has fortified the eyewear with layers of protection so it can work in extreme conditions. It's like a rugged PC but in AR eyewear format.\nBut at around US$3,500, it is priced much higher than regular AR glasses. ODG's regular R-7 smartglasses retail for $2,750. The rugged glasses are even more expensive than Microsoft's $3,000 HoloLens . Information about R-7HL's worldwide availability wasn't immediately provided.\nThe HL in R-7HL stands for \"hazardous location,\" which sums up the purpose of the eyewear. It can be used in locations where regular smartglasses could break, like hospitals, factories, utilities, or chemical production plants.\nThe smartglasses can work in extreme temperatures, and their solid build protects eyes from projectiles. Additionally, they can withstand drops, other shocks, and water splashes.\nThe eyewear is targeted at enterprise use. For example, the smartglasses can be used in the inspection and repair of heavy equipment. Overlaid 3D images could help simulate and fix problems.\nThey could also be used in hospitals, where the R-7HL camera can transmit a live feed of a patient's physical condition to a remote doctor.\nThey could also be useful in the insurance industry, where agents could take snapshots and record the inspection process.\nThe R-7HL has components you'd find in a smartphone. It has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 805 processor, 3GB DDR3 DRAM, 64GB of storage, two 720p see-through frames, and a 1300mAh battery.\nThe device also has a camera that can shoot HD images at 60 frames per second. It has 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS. It has a range of location, weather, and light sensors.\nAdditionally, the smartglasses meet standards set for rugged laptops and devices. It meets the U.S. military's MIL-STD 810G standard for ruggedness and extremes. It also meets ANSI standards for safety and ballistic eye protection against projectiles.\nThe eyewear runs on Android OS and has a custom AR software platform on top of that. It supports the popular Vuforia software platform.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-05T00:00:00Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Mac Pro update: Apple promises another pricey thing it will no doubt abandon after a year", "content": "SHARE \u25bc\nPromising today that a new Mac Pro is being developed, Apple SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller admitted the tech giant rather disappointed the workstation world by making its \"most radical Mac ever\" insufficiently expandable.\nSchiller \u2013 along with SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi, VP of hardware engineering John Ternus, and Mac PR director Bill Evans \u2013 spoke with a handpicked group of favored journalists who were invited to Apple's headquarters in what appears to be an effort to counter discontent among professional power users.\nBefore John Gruber, Ina Fried, John Paczkowski and Matthew Panzarino, Schiller deviated from Apple's standard media playbook \u2013 no commenting on unreleased products \u2013 and promised the future Mac Pro would be \"a modular system\" whenever it appears, which won't be this year.\nApple did not respond to a request to confirm that this meeting actually took place.\nAccording to Gruber's account of the meeting, \"The word 'mistake' was not uttered, but this is about as close as we're going to get to Apple admitting they miscalculated with the current Mac Pro's concept. One word that was uttered, however, was 'sorry.'\"\nApple has been here before. At its developer conference in 2012, after neglecting the Mac Pro for two years, the Cupertino idiot-tax operation released an underwhelming update with 3.2-GHz quad-core Intel Xeon W3565 processor or two 2.4-GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5645 processors, which was already outdated by Intel's 8-core Xeon E5 chips announced three months earlier and a three-year-old ATI Radeon 5770 graphics card.\nIn a blog post at the time, developer Marco Arment called the update \"half-assed\" and said, \"The message is clear: Apple doesn't give a sh** about the Mac Pro.\"\nSuch sentiment was commonplace, and evidently prompted CEO Tim Cook, in an email to Facebook user Stephen Tanner, to break Apple's code of silence and declare, \"We are planning a new Mac Pro for later next year.\"\nAt the end of the following year, on December 19, 2013, Apple released its \"vision for the future of the pro desktop,\" a black cylinder \"designed around an innovative unified thermal core.\"\nIt then proceeded to ignore the Mac Pro for more than 1,200 days.\nThe neglect prompted Arment to speculate last November that Apple has given up on the Pro market. Similar sentiment, not altogether justified , followed the October release of Apple's latest MacBook Pro, which is limited to 16GB of memory, due to heat and battery life constraints.\nWith the revised Mac Pro nowhere in sight, Apple on Tuesday released a minor speed bump update. The $2,999 model now has 6 Xeon CPU cores, up from 4, and dual AMD G500 GPUs, up from AMD G300 GPUs. The $3,999 model now has 8 CPU cores, up from 6, and dual AMD D800 GPUs, up from AMD D500 GPUs.\nThe unified thermal core that Apple celebrated as innovation turned out to be an obstacle to expandability. Schiller acknowledged that the Mac Pro was \"thermally constrained\" and Federighi said, \"Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate.\"\nGruber asked whether Apple was aware how many people have begun to doubt the company's commitment to the needs of Mac Pro users.\nSchiller responded, \"It's a reasonable question, and this is why we're here today, specifically, to address that question above all else.\" \u00ae\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-04T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Most of the users who have adopted Windows 10 were consumers, not commercial customers: The latter are traditionally much slower to migrate machines to a new OS.\nThe most prevalent OS on business PCs, said Spiceworks, was Windows 7, the 2009 edition that has just over three years before Microsoft ends its support. But the operating system in second place, at 14%? That was Windows XP, which Microsoft retired three years ago this month .\nNet Applications' global numbers for Windows 7 and XP in March were 49% and 7%, respectively.\nSpiceworks' study also highlighted what it called the \"penetration rate\" of various Windows versions in businesses, defining the term as \"the percentage of companies running at least one instance of that operating system.\" Those rates were, as expected, considerably higher than the editions' shares.\nFor example, 34% of the companies whose deployment data was evaluated by Spiceworks had one or more systems running Windows 10, while Windows 7's penetration was an almost-unanimous 87%. And Windows XP, which should have been scrubbed from networks years ago, had a worrisome penetration rate of 52%.\nThe penetration rate for Windows 10 did not signal the imminent adoption of the operating system by commercial customers, but it may hint at the level of interest in the new OS or illustrate how actively enterprises are testing Windows 10 prior to deployment.\nSpiceworks' study can be viewed on the organization's website.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-05T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Luckily, the Galaxy S8+ does very well in this test and even though it is not the number one battery performer, it is certainly above the average for flagships these days. Note that we have tested using the Full HD+ resolution that our phones came set to by default (1080 x 2220 pixels).\nSamsung Galaxy S8+ battery test result\nBattery life (hours)\nView all\nThe Galaxy S8 and S8+ get similar, but not equal battery life test results. The Galaxy S8+ Exynos model that we tested scored exactly 8 hours, while the more compact S8 Exynos version topped this with a score of 8 hours and 23 minutes. Interestingly, the Snapdragon model of the Galaxy S8 scored less than the Exynos version: it went 10 minutes short of 8 hours.\nCompare this with the 7 hours and 18 minutes that the already very good Galaxy S7 Edge scored, and you see that Samsung has managed to improve on their last year's phone. The S8 and S8+ also best the Google Pixel XL, the OnePlus 3T, but fall a bit short of the battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus .\nThe Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery will last you through even a very busy day\nIn a nutshell, both the Galaxy S8 with its 3,000 mAh cell, as well as the S8+ with its 3,500 mAh battery run a long time.\nOn a separate note, we have recently noticed that more affordable phones, especially ones with the 14nm Snapdragon 625 system chip, do remarkably well in terms of battery life . In fact, we often get envy-worthy 2-day battery longevity on these phones, while the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are not quite in that territory. Still, when we speak about flagship grade devices, the Galaxy S8+ is definitely among the best out there. With a phone like this, you can be assured that you will get through a busy full day and still have juice left, even if you are a power user, and that is definitely reassuring.\nSamsung Galaxy S8+ recharge test (0 to 100%)\nCharging time (minutes)\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-04T14:10:00Z", "images": []}

We go hands-on\n1:55\nWith a new live TV service, YouTube is wagering young people are as hooked on their phones for a full TV meal as they are for video snacks.\nYouTube TV launches Wednesday, offering a \"skinny bundle\" of about 50 live TV networks online for $35 a month, starting in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco. The service includes a 30-day free trial, and the company will throw in a free Google Chromecast streaming device, worth $35, after your first payment (i.e. after the second month).\nJust don't bank on being able to stream it all through the Roku, Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV you already have.\nIt adds Google's YouTube to the snowballing market for digital live TV, going up against Dish's Sling TV , Sony's PlayStation Vue and AT&T's DirecTV Now , with Hulu expected to follow suit this spring. That means a lot of options if you're looking to drop your traditional pay-TV subscription. The launch also puts the internet giant in competition with traditional pay-TV providers like Comcast and Charter.\nYouTube TV is focusing on its mobile app foremost, even though most streaming customers gravitate to the biggest screen available.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nYouTube TV undercuts a comparable plan from Sling TV, as well as Playstation Vue's cheapest plan. Both of those are priced at $40. It's also in line with DirecTV Now's low-end plan (although DirecTV Now has 10 more channels).\nTo set itself apart, Google's YouTube is focusing on two strengths of its massive free video-clip site: Its popularity with younger viewers and its domination of mobile streaming. Yet the emphasis on watching 60-minute shows or a two-hour basketball game on a phone contradicts how people tend to stream traditional TV programming. Customers who are investing a lot of time in a show prefer the biggest screen available.\nNetflix, the biggest subscription video service by members, has previously said that about two-thirds of its streaming goes to TVs. Mobile is a small, but growing amount. Hulu says more than 70 percent of its viewing occurs on the living-room big screen, while mobile and tablet watching is about 17 percent.\nYouTube TV direct competitor Sling TV says the majority of its viewing hours happen on televisions.\"We know that many people want to watch their favorite shows on the biggest screen possible, but also want the option to take their TV with them,\" Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch said.\nBut from YouTube's vantage point, millennials -- generally defined as people under the age of 35 -- \"love the programming on television but they don't love the experience on television,\" Kelly Merryman, YouTube's vice president of content partnerships, said in an interview. \"How we can reimagine the television experience for the new generation?\nFor YouTube, the answer was a live TV app designed for phones and other mobile devices, with personalization, search and recommendations.\nAt launch, Chromecast is pretty much the only way to get YouTube TV onto your living room TV screen.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nIt also meant offering only one way to watch YouTube TV on an actual TV -- using a Google Chromecast to fling your mobile viewing onto the big screen. (That free Chromecast makes a lot of sense now, right?)\nEven with shorter-form video presented like it's live, bigger screens dominate, according to Pluto TV, a free live-TV-like service that strings together digital videos into bespoke channels. Its users, which skew young, will watch for more than an hour per session.\n\"Because our viewers love to lean back for long periods of time, more than half our viewing occurs on big screens like connected TVs and laptops,\" CEO Tom Ryan said.\nYouTube TV is also available to watch on laptop and desktop computers, which for many young people equates to the biggest screen in the house.\nBut at launch, YouTube TV doesn't have support for other streaming devices like Roku or Amazon Fire TV, even though those products are more popular than Chromecast.

Terms of use .\nJust over four years ago, Apple unveiled a new Mac Pro that it swore would reinvent the concept of a workstation. The new system was definitely daring \u2014 it ditched internal expansion for six Thunderbolt 2 ports and told users with internal hard drives to buy new external chassis and use those instead. It shipped with dual graphics cards as a standard, despite how\u00a0Apple has never demonstrated aptitude or interest in pushing GPU-centric computing (the company\u2019s operating systems have been stuck supporting ancient versions of OpenGL for years now).\nToday, the company finally took a small step towards upgrading the current Mac Pro design, but it also acknowledged what we\u2019ve all known for years \u2014 the trash can aesthetic of the 2013 Mac Pro makes it a serious pain to work with. As of today, Apple has tweaked the Mac Pro to include a six-core CPU (up from four) in the $2,999 model and an eight-core CPU (up from six) in the $3,999 model. The GPUs have also been slightly updated; the $2,999 system now ships with dual D500s, while the $3,999 rig ships with dual D700s. Given that these are GCN 1.0 GPUs with the D700 equivalent to AMD\u2019s old HD 7970, we can\u2019t really recommend them.\nAccording to Daring Fireball , Apple is planning a major overhaul to its Mac Pro lineup next year, with a more modular design and a product that\u2019s easier to update. As for why the Mac Pro hasn\u2019t been updated for four years, here\u2019s DF\u2019s explanation:\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re Apple. You\u2019re faced with the following problem. Three years ago you launched a radical new lineup of Mac Pros. For multiple reasons, you haven\u2019t shipped an update to those machines since. At some point you came to the conclusion that the 2013 Mac Pro concept was fundamentally flawed\u2026 [T]hat tight integration made it hard to update regularly. The idea that expansion could be handled almost entirely by external Thunderbolt peripherals sounded good on paper, but hasn\u2019t panned out in practice. And the GPU design was a bad prediction. Apple bet on a dual-GPU design (multiple smaller GPUs, with \u201cpro\u201d-level performance coming from parallel processing) but the industry has gone largely in the other direction (machines with one big GPU).\nIt\u2019s rather frustrating to see corporations declare, years after the fact, that things end users immediately called out as problems are actually, you know, problems . Heck, Apple\u2019s workstation competitors have been mocking its design with salient points about the limitations of the trash can since the platform shipped four years ago, as captured in the ad below by Boxx:\nI respect Apple for trying to build something new and unusual, I truly do. But the Mac Pro went too far in the wrong direction in its quest to establish itself as unique and different. A whisper-quiet workstation with high-end peripherals is a noble goal, but not if it fundamentally handicaps both the end-user and the corporation that designed it from upgrading the underlying platform.\nWhile Apple has upgraded the Xeons inside the Mac Pro, we recommend against making a purchase until more information is available on what these chips can do. While clock speeds on modern chips have scarcely budged since 2013, certain capabilities, like AVX2, still may not be available. It depends on whether Apple stuck with Ivy Bridge-era Xeons (as I\u2019m guessing they did) or actually updated to a more recent iteration of Intel\u2019s Core architecture.\nApple\u2019s new, \u201ccompletely rethought\u201d Mac Pro will be available next year, as will a new \u201cPro\u201d display. Maybe by then, the (presumably) next-gen Oculus Rift will support it ?\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-04T19:41:27Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Amazon will refund millions of unauthorized in-app purchases made by kids", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nAmazon will refund millions of unauthorized in-app purchases kids made on mobile devices, having now dropped its appeal of\u00a0 last year\u2019s ruling\u00a0 by a federal judge who sided with the Federal Trade Commission in the agency\u2019s lawsuit against Amazon. The FTC\u2019s original complaint said that Amazon should be liable for millions of dollars it charged customers, because of the way its Appstore software was designed \u2013 that is, it allowed kids to spend unlimited amounts of money in games and other apps without requiring parental consent.\nThe\u00a0 FTC had previously settled with both Apple and Google on similar charges, before turning its sights to Amazon.\nThe issue had to do with the way the Amazon Appstore\u2019s in-app purchasing system worked. The Amazon\u00a0Appstore is the store that comes preloaded on Amazon mobile devices, like Kindle Fire tablets, for example, though there is a way to load it onto other Android devices, too.\nOf course,\u00a0many kids\u2019 game developers notoriously try to blur the lines between what\u2019s free and paid. They also often design games in a way that they only fully function\u00a0when kids use\u00a0in-game items, which can be sometimes earned through gameplay or other times purchased through the app itself. Kids are pushed to buy these things regularly \u2013 as any parent can tell you, having experienced their kids\u2019 begging for these items.\nBut in Amazon\u2019s Appstore, which launched back in 2011, the company didn\u2019t originally require passwords on in-app purchases. This allowed kids to buy coins and other items to their hearts\u2019 content. One particularly awful example involved a game called \u201cIce Age Village\u201d that offered an in-app purchase of $99.99.\nAmazon introduced password-protected in-app purchases in March 2012, but then only on those where the purchase exceeded $20. In early 2013, it updated the system again to require passwords, but also allowed a 15-minute window afterwards where no password was required. The FTC said Amazon didn\u2019t obtain \u201cinformed consent\u201d until July 2014.\nTo make matters worse, parents complaining weren\u2019t told how to get a refund and Amazon had even suggested at times that refunds weren\u2019t possible, the FTC\u2019s complaint had said.\nAmazon and the FTC have now agreed to end appeals related to the earlier ruling, the FTC announced on Tuesday, April 4. Another issue that had come into play was the FTC\u2019s request for an injunction to forbid Amazon from similar conduct in the future. The court denied that injunction, the FTC appealed, and Amazon cross-appealed the ruling that said Amazon had violated the law.\nNow the two parties have agreed to end their litigation and begin the refund process.\nMore than $70 million in in-app charges made between November 2011 and May 2016 may be eligible for refunds, the FTC notes. It\u2019s not likely that all affected customers will take the time to make their requests, however.\nAmazon has not yet announced how the refund program will operate or when it launches but these details are to come shortly, says the FTC.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-05T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

By the time parents noticed the charges in their bank statements, it was too late\u2014the company\u2019s policy says all in-app charges are nonrefundable .\nIn April 2016, a federal district court ruled that \u00a0the\u00a0unwitting customers were eligible to seek damages from Amazon. While the FTC scored the big win, it lost a smaller battle: The judge denied its\u00a0request for an injunction\u00a0to permanently ban the e-retailer from charging parents or other account holders without getting permission from them first. Since then, the governmental agency and the online retailer have been embroiled in appeals.\nBoth parties have now agreed to end\u00a0the litigation related to last year\u2019s case, the FTC\u00a0 said in a statement \u00a0April 4. Amazon is set to compensate disgruntled parents for more than $70 million-worth of in-app charges made between November 2011 and May 2016.\nAmazon declined to comment.

Pahl, acting director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.\nThe FTC had leveled similar allegations of unlawfully billing payments for kids\u2019 purchases against Apple and Google around the same time as it charged Amazon. The iPhone maker agreed to refund at least $32.5 million and the Mountain View behemoth had more than $19 million to pay back.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)\nComment\nBy The Tylt\nApple admitted its hyped up redesign of the Mac Pro was a failure and is going back to the drawing board. Critics say Apple's innovation was over with Steve Jobs' death -- the company doesn't have the same innovative vision anymore. Apple and its proponents say the company is pushing the envelope with design; it takes bold steps that often aren't well received at first, but later make complete sense.\u00a0What do you think?\nPERSPECTIVES\nIn a rare admission of failure, Apple said its\u00a0 futuristic trash-can-like Mac Pro \u00a0was a mistake. Its design fundamentally misjudged the market and now Apple has to ditch their design. Apple's admission comes after several high profile gaffes like\u00a0 removing the headphone jack \u00a0from the iPhone and forcing MacBook users into\u00a0 dongle hell . Developer Michael Tsai has a running list of\u00a0 everything that's wrong with Apple \u00a0here. Critics say Apple has lost sight of what makes good design good \u00a0-- it's not about making a pretty product.\nNo more. Now, although the products are indeed even more beautiful than before, that beauty has come at a great price. Gone are the fundamental principles of good design: discoverability, feedback, recovery, and so on. Instead, Apple has, in striving for beauty, created fonts that are so small or thin, coupled with low contrast, that they are difficult or impossible for many people with normal vision to read. We have obscure gestures that are beyond even the developer's ability to remember. We have great features that most people don't realize exist.\nApple's fans say it can't please everyone. The company is working to usher in a wireless future and obviously the transition will be messy. People freaked out over the iPhone 7's lack of a headphone jack, but that didn't stop consumers from buying the phone. It\u00a0 recorded record sales \u00a0despite all the criticism.\u00a0\n\"We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release. \"Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.\"\nThis is the future!

Their businesses could be greatly affected by the way in which the Trump administration deals with the threat of Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear program.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nLike many in the tech industry, I have traveled dozens of times to Japan, Hong Kong, China, Taipei, Singapore, and South Korea as part of my job.\nThis region of the world has been important to our tech market as it has become our key manufacturing arm. It has made it possible for most U.S. companies to deliver a product at better prices. Thus, these countries have flourished over the years.\nThis region has also given us major tech competitors such as Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Samsung, LG, and others.\nIf you travel to these parts of the world you are perhaps more aware of the political climate in many of these countries. You know that China believes Taipei belongs to it. And now that Hong Kong is a region of China, it is subject more and more to China\u2019s political rules and regulations.\nAt the moment the major tinder box in this region is South Korea and North Korea, and the fate of the rest of the region is closely linked to the fate of those two nations. So tech leaders need to be watching this area of the world closer than ever.\nSouth Korea is vitally important to the tech world for many reasons. Samsung not only makes smartphones, but also appliances, computers, hard drives, and TVs. But most importantly to the tech industry, it is a major supplier of the semiconductors and flash memory, and provides chips to Apple and many other big tech players.\nadvertisement\nHyundai and LG also provide a range of tech products and appliances. POSCO is one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world. All told, South Korea has more than a hundred major companies providing products and services all over the world.\nSome years back, on a trip to South Korea, I asked a top tech official what concerns him the most about tech business in Asia. He told me one of his greatest concerns is the collapse of North Korea, which might result in millions of North Koreans rushing over the border, which he said could destabilize or paralyze South Korea\u2019s social structures and economy. Many people in North Korea have relatives in South Korea, and they would almost certainly seek refuge with them. And many of those relatives likely work in the companies and factories that turn out the tech products we use. This type of personal, political, and economic disruption could have a major impact on South Korea\u2019s tech companies.\nIf it happened, South Korean companies might lose their ability to supply component parts to other tech companies around the world, not to mention the disruption in the flow of completed products that come from the country. The official felt it could take many months for South Korean officials to re-stabilize the region. And it could take years for tech companies to get back to producing and delivering their products on time.\nOf course the damage would be far greater than just shipping delays and business disruptions. The human toll could be devastating for the country. We may see a major humanitarian crisis if South Korea has trouble absorbing the inflow of North Koreans, most of whom would need assistance to stay alive.\nIt\u2019s through this frame that I\u2019ve been watching the recent moves by North Korea to advance its long-range nuclear reach. I fear this is more than saber rattling given the instability of North Korea\u2019s leadership. Kim Jong-un may do anything he can to remain in power.\nThis week President Trump meets with China\u2019s Premier XI Jinping and is reportedly going to tell him that if China won\u2019t work bilaterally with the U.S. to solve the North Korea problem, the U.S. with deal with the nuclear threat on its own .\nadvertisement\nI don\u2019t profess to know exactly what \u201cgo it alone\u201d means, but as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said \u201call options are on the table.\u201d Given the fact that our current administration is unpredictable and has little experience in dealing with a crisis like the one we have brewing in North Korea, a surgical military strike against North Korea\u2019s nuclear sites seems possible. Even an outside chance of such an attack could cause major panic, and might start the flow of North Korean citizens over the border to the south. This would be hard for South Korea to control.\nSome U.S. companies have this same concern, and are already working on contingency plans should their own business be disrupted by what could happen in South Korea.\nFor small companies seeking optional sources for components, this is probably a manageable problem. They can go to other suppliers in the region for the parts they get from South Korean suppliers.\nBut for Apple and other big consumer electronics companies that buy large numbers of chips, displays, and other components from Samsung and other South Korean companies, this could be a big problem.\nIt would test their parts sourcing teams in particular. And, in general, it would test their ability to minimize the impact on their ability to deliver products to their customers on time.\nMy hope is that China agrees to work to keep North Korea from advancing its nuclear program. Trump\u2019s meeting with China\u2019s premier will be the most important one since coming to office. But should China not agree to help, or in the end not be able\u00a0to keep North Korea from becoming more aggressive with its nuclear program, the U.S. may be on its own. This would be an extremely difficult test for a president with no foreign policy experience.\nadvertisement\nA good friend of mine who travels to Asia 10\u00a0to 12\u00a0times a year and understands the political situation there says the only way to neutralize North Korea (and this may sound counterintuitive) is to help it find a way to feel more secure. If North Korea felt safe, and part \u00a0of the northeast Asian economy, it might begin focusing on its own prosperity, my friend says. This might make Kim Jong-un more willing to surrender his country\u2019s nuclear deterrent. More sanctions or, more disastrously, any military action, would not end well.\nI hope there is a moderate voice inside the Trump administration who understands this option. Silicon Valley\u2019s tech companies should use whatever influence they have\u00a0to make sure the North Korean problem ends without event.\nadvertisement\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-05T19:00:08Z", "images": []}

Prices are going up, and expensive devices are in demand.\nOn average, the price of PCs and phones will go up by 2 percent this year, Gartner said in a research report released on Thursday. The calculations are based on U.S. dollars and average market sizes.\nBreaking those numbers down, PC prices are expected to go up 1.4 percent this year, while mobile phone prices will go up 4.3 percent.\nThe prices will go up largely due to the rising prices of components. Also, more users are upgrading to more expensive and feature-rich mobile handsets.\nThe days of users preferring to buy the cheapest products are gone, said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner.\nBuyers are less price sensitive and are instead buying devices \"that suit their lifestyles,\" Atwal said.\nGartner's forecast is in line with a projection in February by Lenovo's chief operating officer, Gianfranco Lanci, who said PC prices would go up this year due to a shortage of DRAM, SSDs, batteries, and LCDs.\nThe cost of components like NAND flash have doubled since June last year, Gartner said.\nThe overall cost of purchasing components is going up. Moreover, millennials are willing to spend more on devices.\nThis year is expected to big for smartphones. Samsung has launched the Galaxy S8 smartphones, and Apple is expected to launch its 10th anniversary iPhone later this year. Premium-priced smartphones will go up by roughly 4 percent, Gartner said.\nAndroid phones will suffer the most from the price increases. In emerging markets like China and India, Android phones are popular because of their affordability, but prices are also going up in those countries.\nHigh-end Android smartphones offer more differentiation on features than generic low-end phones, giving a reason for buyers to spend a bit more to upgrade.\nA good barometer for mobile phone pricing is the Chinese market. Global pricing of Chinese branded smartphones will go up to RMB 2,000 (US$290) by the end of this year from RMB 1,700 (US$246) at the end of last year, analyst firm Trendforce said last month . That's partly because NAND flash supply is tightening.\nAccording to Gartner, smartphone shipments worldwide this year will total 1.9 billion units, up from 1.89 billion last year.\nThe PC market has slowed down, and it is driven now by high-priced gaming PCs and 2-in-1s. Buyers of those PCs are willing to spend more money on their computers.\nThat trend is changing the types of computers shipped by PC makers, who\u00c2 are focused on selling higher-priced products that can deliver larger profit margins.\nLow-end laptops and desktops will remain available, but PC makers like Dell and HP are slimming down those offerings. Low-cost laptops like Chromebooks typically have aging components, little storage, low-resolution webcams, and limited memory.\nGartner estimates 426 million computing devices, including PCs and tablets, will ship this year, dropping from 439 million last year. PC shipments will total 265 million this year, dropping from 270 million last year.\nShipment of tablet devices like the iPad will total 161 million, dropping from 169 million last year, the analyst group predicted.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Please read the rules before joining the discussion.\nThe hidden details in Comcast's wireless plan\nRob Pegoraro, Special for USA TODAY Published 8:52 a.m. ET April 7, 2017 | Updated 9:21 a.m. ET April 7, 2017\nCLOSE\nComcast is introducing its new wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, later this year. Veuer's Amanda Kabbabe (@kabbaber) has more. Buzz60\n(Photo: Comcast)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE\nDo you want to have Comcast as your wireless provider, too?\nThe telecom company that started as a television provider and now has more broadband than TV subscribers is getting into the wireless business. Comcast announced Thursday that it would begin offering smartphone service on Verizon\u2019s network, backed up by its 16 million Wi-Fi hotspots\u2014but its sales pitch for the forthcoming Xfinity Mobile skips over some key points.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know, gleaned from the press call Comcast held\u00a0and subsequent conversations with publicists for the Philadelphia company.\n\u2022\u00a0You need Comcast Internet to sign up for Xfinity Mobile. That\u2019s because Comcast sees Xfinity Mobile as a way to convince existing customers to stick around. As Comcast cable president Dave Watson said during the call: \u201cIt will be designed to support the core cable business.\u201d\n\u2022\u00a0Comcast\u2019s \u201cunlimited\u201d wireless isn\u2019t. The company touts a $45 unlimited rate, but its press release\u2019s fine print notes a limit: \u201cReduced speeds after 20 GB of cellular data usage.\u201d Instead of Verizon LTE broadband speeds that averaged 28 megabits per second in PCMag\u2019s tests last year , you\u2019ll be slowed to 1.5 Mbps.\nTwenty gigabytes is still a lot of data, especially since the service will connect automatically to Comcast Wi-Fi when available. And Comcast, unlike the big four carriers, will let you share as much of that as you want with a computer or tablet when using your phone as a mobile hotspot.\nBut like the 1 terabyte limit of many Comcast Internet plans , it\u2019s a threshold some users will surpass to their dismay.\n\u2022\u00a0The unlimited rate may not be the best deal anyway. That $45 unlimited rate requires an expensive \u201cPremier\u201d bundle of either Comcast Internet and TV or a \u201ctriple play\u201d package of Internet, TV and phone service. The cheapest eligible deal I found ran $160 a month; for all lower plans, \u201cunlimited\u201d wireless would cost $65 instead.\nThat still beats Verizon\u2019s $70 unlimited-data rate , but most users would be better taking Comcast\u2019s \u201cBy the Gig\u201d \u00e0 la carte option: $12 per gigabyte across every line on an account. Five gigabytes of data, more than the vast majority of U.S. subscribers use each month, would cost $60. If you guess wrong, you\u2019ll be able to switch plans at any time using the Comcast app on your phone.\n\u2022\u00a0Free calling and texting, really. Like the big four wireless carriers, Comcast will include unlimited voice and messaging service with every line. Unlike them, it won\u2019t add an \u201caccess charge\u201d to cover those calls and texts.\nAnd since the by-the-gig option includes 100 megabytes of free cellular data, subscribers who use very little data or rarely stray beyond the range of Comcast Wi-Fi will owe nothing beyond taxes and other government-imposed fees.\n\u2022\u00a0A limited choice of phones. Comcast will start by selling only 10 models: Apple\u2019s iPhone SE, 6S, 6S Plus, 7 and 7 Plus; Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, S8 and S8+; and LG\u2019s X Power. You\u2019ll have to wait for the option to bring another model like Google\u2019s Pixel or LG\u2019s new G6 \u00a0to Comcast\u2019s service.\nComcast will offer installment-plan payments, freeing you from having to come up with the $650-plus price of an iPhone 7 upfront. Your phone will arrive locked to Comcast\u2019s service, the usual tradeoff with phone financing \u2014but the company says it will unlock the device on request, so you\u2019ll be able to use cheap prepaid service during international travel.\n\u2022\u00a0Some details remain a mystery. Comcast won\u2019t offer a date for Xfinity Mobile\u2019s commercial debut, and it\u2019s offered no data about its international-roaming rates beyond assurances that they\u2019ll be competitive.\nRelated:\u00a0\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-07T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Power study finds Surface buyers are happier than their iPad counterparts. They're younger and prefer Microsoft's design.\nby\nApril 6, 2017 5:38 PM PDT\nTechnically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\nHave you noticed a certain giddiness in some of your friends lately?\nI'm thinking about the ones who use a Microsoft Surface.\nI only ask because J.D Power has just emitted its US Tablet Satisfaction Study and it declared that Surface owners experience deeper sensations of satisfaction than iPad buyers.\nApple fanpersons might turn pale when they learn the main reasons for this greater Surface joy are, according to the Power people, \"its top rankings in the features and styling & design factors.\"\nAnd the darkness descends. Apple being beaten in styling and design? Does Jony Ive know? Will someone dare tell him?\nJ.D Power says the Surface scored 855 out of a possible 1,000. This beat Apple by 6 points.\nThe study relied on the feelings of 2,238 US tablet owners who have owned their tablets for less than a year. It was performed between October and December 2016.\nIt measures tablet joy across five areas: performance, ease of operation, features, styling and design, and cost.\nSurface owners were, apparently, most elated with the Surface's connectivity, pre-loaded apps and accessories. They were also moved by machine's size, build and, yes, the beauty of the design.\nHere, though, is something else that Cupertino might find disturbing in this study. Surface owners tend to be younger. They're also more likely to be early adopters. They also seem to rather like being first among their friends to get one.\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A Microsoft spokeswoman, however, did.told me: \"Building products that deliver the power, versatility, and dependability that allows our customers to create their best work in any setting is fundamental to everything the team does.\"\nOf course, one issue here could be that Apple has somewhat neglected the iPad. It's been too busy pushing phones and watches and forgetting it makes computers.\nMore Technically Incorrect\nIt just released a base iPad .\nOtherwise, there are merely rumors of what might come next. What is clear, however, is that Apple took a long time deciding what the iPad was -- especially iPad Pro, the most direct competition to the more productivity-focused Surface.\nIt first marketed it as a computer . Which made Microsoft laugh . Recently, it's decided that the iPad Pro is better than a computer and that computers are rather pass\u00e9 .\nA tiny consolation for Cupertino might lie in the study insisting that general satisfaction with tablets has risen.\nOh, what am I saying? They don't do consolation at Apple. So when are the sexier, new iPads coming?\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-07T00:38:11Z", "images": []}

She was joined in the study by Joshua Ackerman of the University of Michigan and Francesca Gino of Harvard Business School.\nThe three looked at a database of about 3000 iPhones on a website where people can register their stolen, lost or found devices. They discovered that people were less likely to try to track down their lost phones when an upgrade was available.\nThis was \"a nice proxy for carelessness in the real world,\" Bellezza said. The results were replicated in their own survey of 600 mobile phone owners, she said.\nThe scholars checked to see whether their findings applied outside the smartphone market.\nIn another test, they gave all the participants a free mug. Some participants were shown nicer mugs to indicate the availability of an upgrade, while others were not shown other mugs. The participants then played a game where they placed their mugs on top of a Jenga tower. (In Jenga, a tower becomes progressively more unstable as people remove blocks.)\nThe people who had been shown better mugs were more likely to play the game in such a way that their towers collapsed, potentially damaging their more ordinary mugs.\nThe researchers also surveyed more than 1,000 consumers of items like shampoo, sunglasses, toothpaste and perfume, and found that they were more likely to be wasteful or careless with a product if they knew an improved version was available.\nWhen we buy something new, Bellezza explained, it's as if we're opening a mental account in our head that says we should hang on to it for, say, two years. People experience guilt if they feel the urge to buy a new version of a product when the one that they own is working perfectly well.\nLosing or breaking it is presumably a way to buy a new one without experiencing too much guilt over the expenditure, she said.\nLoading\nOne way to try to counteract this unconscious behaviour is to think about donating our older purchases to friends or family members, Bellezza said: \"When we are thinking about giving things to someone that we care about, we become less careless.\"\nThe New York Times\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-08T12:16:31Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Android and Windows sell way more devices than Apple, but that's not as important as it sounds", "content": "Android and Windows sell way more devices than Apple, but that's not as important as it sounds\nJeff Dunn\nEmail\nAmong the many noteworthy things Apple said during its Mac announcement -meets- apology earlier this week was the revelation that, according to Apple marketing boss Phil Schiller, the Mac\u2019s total user base is nearing 100 million. That figure caught the eye of some onlookers, since it falls well short of its rival Windows operating system. More specifically, Microsoft said last September that it had 400 million users on Windows 10 alone.\nSounds pretty bad for Apple, right? Well, as this chart from Statista reminds us, market share isn\u2019t the end-all, be-all for tech industry success. If you mix recent device shipment and spending figures from Gartner with Apple\u2019s sales numbers in 2016, a familiar trend reasserts itself: The Cupertino company doesn\u2019t have to sell the most devices to make the most money.\nRoughly 11% of phones sold last year were iPhones, for instance, but Apple\u2019s popularity in the high-end of the market \u2014 where it almost exclusively sits \u2014 was enough to capture more than a third of the phone industry\u2019s total revenue. One analyst recently said the company took more than 90% of the industry\u2019s profits last quarter beyond that.\nIn other words, it\u2019s about quality more than quantity. The gap isn\u2019t as dramatic with the Mac as it is with the iPhone and iPad, but the fact that it\u2019s still worth roughly $US25 billion after years of fading relevance to Apple is impressive (and well above Microsoft\u2019s competing Surface business). Still, just because the Mac is making money doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s keeping customers happy \u2014 which is why Apple is promising to do better by its \u201cpro\u201d users from now on.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-07T21:47:29Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Why smart stores don't check out", "content": "TechWorld\nTwitter\nWhy smart stores don't check out\nAmazon, Starbucks and Apple want you to walk into their stores, pick up your items, then walk right out. There's just one problem.\nMike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 08 April, 2017 21:00\n-\nComments\nCash registers are dumb. Why do we still have them?\nInvented in 1879 to keep saloon employees from stealing, the cash register combines the functions of a calculator to add up the purchases and a lockbox to keep cash safe.\nIt assumes that retail employees have no verifiable way to add up numbers. And it assumes customers are paying in cash. Nowadays, most people have a smartphone and pay electronically. So the assumptions are gone. Yet cash registers remain.\nThe success of online retail demonstrates that you don't need a Victorian-era contraption to sell things. You can do it all electronically.\nBut brick-and-mortar retail stores have a problem that online stores don't: shoplifting. Without a cashier verifying the purchase and providing a paper receipt, it's hard to stop some people from just taking stuff and walking out without paying.\nThe whole cash register model now represents a ritual that exists mainly as an anti-theft system.\nThat sounds like an easy problem to solve. Turns out it's not.\nWhy Amazon Go isn't ready to go\nAmazon Go is that company's latest concept for disrupting brick-and-mortar retail. The company's vision is that you shop normally, then just walk out of the store without waiting in a line or interacting with a cashier or point-of-sale system.\nAmazon\nThe Amazon Go concept store watches you shop and lets you skip the cash register.\nAmazon Go is a single 1,800-square-foot store in downtown Seattle that sells groceries as well as prepared food that's ready to eat. Amazon Go also features \"Amazon Meal Kits,\" which are pre-portioned ingredients with recipes, a concept similar to Blue Apron .\nThe Amazon Go store is not open to the public. Amazon has been developing the store's technology for years and \"beta testing\" the store with employees for months. A report in The Wall Street Journal claimed that Amazon intended to open last month but delayed the launch because of technical issues.\nThat's not surprising. Amazon is attempting something very bold and new.\nAmazon is using a combination of computer vision, sensors and deep-learning algorithms to know who's buying what. Amazon says that its patented \"Just Walk-Out Technology\" uses artificial intelligence (A.I.) comparable to the A.I. used in self-driving cars.\nHere's how the store works. When you enter, you scan a QR code on the Amazon Go app at the front door. That scan announces to the store's system that you're there and preemptively authenticates the purchases you're about to make.\nThen you shop.\nAmazon's \"Just Walk-Out Technology\" has one job: to figure out what you're taking out of the store.\nAs you remove items from the shelf, A.I. uses multiple inputs to figure out what you grabbed. Cameras watch you take it. Scales built into the shelves provide data to calculate the weight of what you took. Amazon's patent filing suggests that the system may also refer to past purchases to help identify current ones.\nIn other words, intelligent software analyzes a video feed to determine that you removed something from the shelf that looked like a cupcake. It considers data from the shelf, which is also a scale, and calculates that you took something that weighs about as much as a cupcake. And it checks your purchase history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it knows you're a cupcake-eating maniac. After all that input, the software decides that you took a cupcake off the shelf and adds it to your list, which is kept up-to-date in real time as you shop.\nIf you place an item back on the shelf, the item is removed from the list.\nIt's possible, based on patent applications, that Amazon intends to use both face and body recognition (metrics like height and weight) to continuously identify you when you wander around the store picking up items.\nHere's the best part: When you're done shopping, you just walk out of the store. As you leave, sensors at the door detect that you're exiting, and your Amazon account is charged for the items you got.\nIt's like shoplifting, except you have to pay for everything you took.\nThe technology is advanced. It may be too advanced.\nA Bloomberg report said the Amazon Go system becomes overwhelmed when the store gets crowded, and that it's relying on humans to supervise the A.I. to make sure it correctly identifies the foods it's charging for. (Amazon did not respond to my request for an interview.)\nIt appears that Amazon's \"Just Walk-Out Technology\" makes a lot of mistakes, which is probably OK within reason. But it also may crash, bringing the whole system to a halt, which is not OK.\nAmazon dominates retail already. Walmart is a global retail giant worth $215 billion (the company's value based on stock price). By comparison, Amazon is worth $430 billion -- twice the value of Walmart.\nIt seems like Amazon has a sweet deal going with online retail. Why would they want to enter into the brick-and-mortar space?\nThe truth is that there are many items that consumers won't buy without seeing or trying them in person. Think of couches, for example. You probably don't want to buy a couch unless you can feel how comfortable it is.\nThere are other items, such as your lunch, that are too perishable for shipping.\nAmazon has been trying a range of ideas for breaking into the $800 billion U.S. grocery industry. The Amazon Fresh delivery service is now available in 20 U.S. cities. Prime Now delivers groceries from local grocery stores in a few locations. Subscribe & Save lets people subscribe to buy paper towels and a range of other non-perishable but frequently consumed items for delivery like other Amazon items.\nA system like Amazon's \"Just Walk-Out Technology\" adds convenience to shopping. But the real revolution is a quantum leap in behavioral data. In the same way that companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook track every mouse movement, every click, every scroll and every hesitation while you're browsing the Internet, Amazon Go's system potentially brings that level of customer awareness to the brick-and-mortar space. They'll know if you hesitated to buy that cupcake. They'll know you spent three minutes browsing the burrito options without finding something you wanted. They'll know exactly how long you were in the store, which sections you checked out and of course what items you bought, exactly.\nIt's likely that Amazon will open the Amazon Go store to the public sometime in the next few months. They will probably have to limit the number of customers allowed in the store at the same time. And the \"Just Walk-Out Technology\" will make a lot of errors for the next few years, requiring human supervisors to monitor and correct those errors. For the foreseeable future, Amazon Go will be a half-baked mirage.\nAmazon will accept losses resulting from errors as the price of learning how to do no-cashier retail. Eventually, the payoff could be huge. Once Amazon makes \"Just Walk-Out Technology\" reliable and relatively error-free, the company can roll out stores nationwide, then worldwide.\nLike self-driving cars, however, automated stores that really work are years away, and for the same reason: A.I. just isn't good enough yet.\nStarbuck's Mobile Order & Pay is hot, but still has grande problems\nStarbucks is also working on the elimination of cash registers and cashiers. The company's app enables a service called Mobile Order & Pay, where you can order anything on the Starbucks menu via the app and pick it up without interacting with a cashier.\nThe company last week opened a mobile-only store at its Seattle headquarters.\nHere's the company's dirty little secret: Mobile Order & Pay doesn't really work that well. (Starbucks did not return my request for comment.)\nSometimes customers place their order at the wrong store. I've done this myself a few times. That means the product is wasted at the wrong store, and the customer has to wait in line like everybody else at the right store.\nOther times customers pick up somebody else's mobile order by accident. (I'm a heavy user of Mobile Order & Pay, and I live in constant fear that somebody else will get my tall drip -- clearly my coffee order reflects who I am as a person -- and I'll get their pumpkin spice latte with 12 shots of coconut syrup.)\nMobile Order & Pay can be great for coffee thieves bold enough to just grab somebody else's order. In stores where this happens frequently, the drinks are placed out of reach, forcing Mobile Order & Pay users to wait for a barista to give them their order.\nStarbucks executives have hinted that they're working on perfecting Mobile Order & Pay. But making it function as it should will take years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the development of more advanced technology.\nWhile Mobile Order & Pay is worthwhile for Starbucks (because their long-line problem is bad, coffee is so cheap and errors are fast and cheap to make right), it actually doesn't work well and isn't exportable to other retail situations that aren't selling what is essentially flavored water.\nApple's 'automation' depends on an army of employees\nApple was the first major retailer to enable a smartphone-based system where you can pick your product and waltz out of the store without interacting with a cashier, launching their EasyPay self-checkout system years ago.\nThe Apple Store app enables you to process your purchase as if you were buying online, then walk out of the store with the item.\nThis system isn't especially replicable. Apple doesn't use advanced technology for this feature. And one benefit of self-checkout should include cost savings because fewer employees are required. But with Apple, the opposite is true. The system works to deter theft only because Apple Stores employ dozens of employees, often for stores that are really a small single room.\nApple's system works for Apple because that company sells very expensive items at mass market scale, enabling them to afford an army of watchful employees.\nAutomated retail is years away\nAmazon, Starbucks and Apple create the illusion that the era of automated, smartphone-based brick-and-mortar retail is here.\nThe truth is that the technology behind these stores doesn't work nearly as well as it appears to. And the systems developed thus far can't be extended to the wider world of retail stores.\nSomeday, stores will enable you to skip the cash register altogether. But for now, I just don't buy it.\nJoin the newsletter!\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-08T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Qualcomm officially countersues Apple as legal battle continues", "content": "Qualcomm officially countersues Apple as legal battle continues\nReddit\nQualcomm this evening revealed that it is countersuing Apple as the legal battle between the two companies heats up. While it had been previously reported that Qualcomm was considering legal action, the company made it official today in a 134-page filing\u2026\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\nIn the filing, Qualcomm\u00a0firmly denied the allegations made by Apple. The chip maker stated\u00a0that Apple is trying to use its power to force Qualcomm into lowering royalties for its own\u00a0sake (via CNET ):\n\u201cApple\u2019s goal is clear \u2014 to leverage its immense power to force Qualcomm into accepting less than fair value for the patented technologies that have led innovation in cellular technology and helped Apple generate more than $760 billion in iPhone sales,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing.\nAdditionally, Qualcomm accused Apple of breach of contract and interfering with agreements and relationships Qualcomm has with other companies. The company also accuses Apple of withholding payments that are part of\u00a0a previously agreed upon relationship for high-speed technology. Furthermore,\u00a0Apple is being accused of deliberately making false statements to the government relating to Qualcomm\u2019s business.\nWhile Apple argued in its lawsuit that Qualcomm had caused damages to its business, Qualcomm states in its lawsuit that \u201cto the extent that Apple has suffered damages, if at all, all damages were caused by Apple\u2019s own actions.\u201d\nPerhaps most notably, Qualcomm alleges in its lawsuit that Apple knowingly under-clocked the Qualcomm LTE chip in the iPhone 7 to get of rid of discrepancy between models with the Intel chip. Apple also allegedly threatened Qualcomm to prevent it from making public comparisons that unearthed the\u00a0\u201csuperior performance of Qualcomm-powered iPhones.\u201d\nApple originally sued Qualcomm earlier this year for $1 billion over patent royalties . Apple\u2019s lawsuit followed an\u00a0FTC complaint that alleged Qualcomm engaged in monopolistic practices to prevent Apple from sourcing key components from\u00a0competitors. For its part, Qualcomm\u00a0 responded \u00a0and explained that\u00a0Apple \u201cintentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations.\u201d\nOriginally, it had been reported that Qualcomm was mulling retaliatory\u00a0legal action against Apple, but that it hoped the business relationship between the two would go unaffected. Qualcomm, in its legal filing toady, spoke fondly of Apple and its effect on consumer technology:\n\u201cApple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm\u2019s fundamental cellular technologies,\u201d Qualcomm said. \u201cNow, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies.\u201d\nWhen asked for comment, Apple referred back to the comment it made in January:\n\u201cFor many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations.\u201d\nGuides\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-10T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Jay-Z\u2019s Shortsighted Spotify Purge Won\u2019t Help Tidal\u2013Or His Fans", "content": "Jay-Z\u2019s Shortsighted Spotify Purge Won\u2019t Help Tidal\u2013Or His Fans\nBy John Paul Titlow\n6 minute Read\nI am, admittedly, worth far less than $610 million. So far be it from me to critique the business acumen of Shawn Carter\u2014the rapper and entrepreneur better known as Jay Z\u2014who Forbes says is worth about that much. But something about his latest move doesn\u2019t seem destined for success.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nOver the weekend, most of Jay Z\u2019s albums disappeared from Spotify and Apple Music , leaving his own Tidal streaming service as one of the few places where fans could stream his most popular releases, like Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint. (For reasons that are unclear to me, most of Jay Z\u2019s catalog returned to Apple Music earlier today, but it\u2019s still missing from Spotify.) It\u2019s obvious what Jay is probably going for here: By pulling his music from the biggest subscription music streaming service on the internet, Spotify, he hopes to give fans one more reason to choose his struggling service, Tidal. But will it work?\nThe move comes at a moment of mixed fortunes for Tidal. The music service recently struck a deal with Sprint that boosted its value to $600 million and promised Tidal a wider audience through an as-yet-undefined music offering for Sprint mobile phone subscribers. It was a fortuitously timed partnership for Tidal, which has struggled to rise up beyond its self-reported 3 million subscribers, while Spotify breaks 50 million and Apple is catching up alarmingly fast. Earlier this year, a Norwegian newspaper accused Tidal of inflating its subscriber numbers , which may have been as low as 850,000\u00a0at the time of the 3 million subscriber claim.\nSo, shoring up exclusive access to music by superstar artists like Jay Z should help reverse the trend, right? Not if you\u2019ve been paying attention. In fact, hardly anyone knows this reality more intimately than Tidal. The service, co-owned by Jay Z and 15 other high-profile artists , has made music exclusivity a central part of its strategy. \u00a0The company\u2019s name is practically synonymous with exclusive album releases from big name artists like Kanye West, Rihanna, and Beyonce. While last year\u2019s string of Tidal exclusives helped inject the company\u2019s name into the cultural dialogue (complete with an SNL skit about the service), it did little to eat away at Spotify and Apple\u2019s dominance. Indeed, the limited streaming availability of Kayne West\u2019s Life of Pablo seemed to drive many people back into the arms of illegal downloading\u00a0 even as it inspired others to go sign up for Tidal.\nAfter half a year of high-profile exclusives, the recording industry seemed to change its tune about going along with the strategy last August after Frank Ocean snuck around his record contract with Universal\u2019s Def Jam by fulfilling it with\u00a0the short visual album Endless\u00a0 right before independently dropping another album, Blond, on Apple Music . This contractual sleight of hand\u2014combined with the limited global reach of individual streaming platforms\u2014reportedly helped push the already exclusive-weary Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge toward his new policy: No more streaming exclusives with Universal artists . UMG\u2019s move seems to mirror an industry sentiment, since there have been so few of these types of exclusives since last summer.\nNew releases are a bit different from back catalogs. New albums can lead to a huge spike in listening by eager fans, while back catalogs help maintain a more consistent, day-to-day flow of streaming activity (and often, millions in revenue for well-known artists). Back catalogs are also, in theory, a selling point for music services. If you\u2019re a huge Garth Brooks fan who owns an Amazon Echo, you\u2019re likely to be drawn toward Amazon Music Unlimited with its exclusive access to Brooks\u2019s catalog and cheaper monthly price for Echo owners. But by and large, this type of one-off catalog exclusivity doesn\u2019t appear to do much to move the needle on subscriber numbers. Again, just ask Tidal. Until recently , Tidal offered exclusive streaming access to Prince\u2019s entire catalog, but there\u2019s no evidence yet that this move translated into millions and millions more Tidal subscribers, despite the shocking and unexpected death of the pop legend last year (death pretty much always results in a huge spike in sales, and more recently streams, for famous musicians). While Tidal certainly saw a jump in app downloads last April when\u00a0Prince died and Beyonce\u2019s\u00a0Lemonade was released, the company hasn\u2019t yet come out boasting much in the way of exciting subscriber growth in the last year.\nSo, despite new releases from megastars like Kanye and back catalog exclusives from legendary acts like Prince and Neil Young, Tidal still hasn\u2019t managed to come anywhere close to the subscribers of even the second-place streamer Apple Music (which notably launched in 2015, three months after Tidal). So what makes Jay Z think his albums will make a difference, especially this late in the game?\nadvertisement\nIt\u2019s conceivable, though a bit far-fetched, to envision a Tidal-led coup against Spotify, in which some of Jay Z\u2019s artist co-owners like Beyonce or Kanye West agree to start pulling their albums from other streaming services. With enough notable gaps in music libraries between services, this could become a more meaningful competitive difference between services. But between the contractual limitations artists have with their labels\u2013not all musicians have as much control over their work, or where it is or isn\u2019t available, as Jay Z does\u2013and the fact that Tidal\u2019s audience is so small, this scenario seems unlikely. More than anything, it would be ill-advised.\nIt\u2019s one thing for a popular artist to to \u201cwindow\u201d\u2013industry jargon for delaying or restricting\u2013their releases from streaming platforms (as Adele did ) or hold out on streaming altogether (as The Beatles did until late 2015 ). It\u2019s quite another for artists to yank their catalogs from streaming services after they\u2019ve already been available (hello,\u00a0 Tay Tay ). As streaming grows, this type of maneuver naturally becomes more hostile to music fans.\nTake Jay Z. As of right now, the rapper boasts 13 million monthly listeners on Spotify. That\u2019s 13 million people who listen to Jay Z\u2019s music regularly on Spotify (as opposed to more casual, occasional listeners) who suddenly have gaps in their music collections and grayed-out track titles on their playlists. For those listeners, this is an annoyance. Sure, some diehard Jay Z fans who were already considering a Tidal subscription might sign up for it, but it\u2019s hard to envision many people doing that. Instead, some will supplement their Spotify listening with other artists in the service\u2019s vast, seemingly unlimited sea of music. Others may get their Jay Z fix on YouTube. Some may pirate their favorite albums. But it\u2019s safe to assume that a great many of them will never pay for two music services at once, since the content offering and features of most of these services are primarily the same.\nThis is exactly why new album exclusives are so problematic and unpopular: They may have a theoretical benefit for one streaming platform in its war against its rivals, but the strategy essentially uses music fans as pawns in that battle and gives them new, unnecessary hoops to jump through. In essence, it\u2019s a bunch of very rich people duking it out for dominance and screwing up your party playlists in the process.\nJay Z\u2019s disappearing act comes just days after Spotify announced a new deal with UMG that will allow the label to hold new releases back from Spotify\u2019s free tier temporarily. It\u2019s a compromise in which Spotify reverses its long-held protection of the free, ad-supported tier in order to placate the music industry, which has long been frustrated by the lower revenue generated by free streaming\u2013the ad-supported tier earns more money for the labels. Giving artists and labels the option to \u201cwindow\u201d new albums (and who knows, perhaps back catalogs in future deals with the labels as well) from the free tier\u00a0is a reasonable compromise that lets labels earn more from new releases and lessens the need for more listener-hostile exclusives and other industry turf war tactics. At least, let\u2019s hope that\u2019s the case.\nadvertisement\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-10T22:45:43Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Foxconn said to offer $27B for Toshiba's memory chip business", "content": "TechWorld\nFoxconn said to offer $27B for Toshiba's memory chip business\nThe price for Toshiba's memory chip business is getting higher as more bids roll in\nAgam Shah (IDG News Service) 11 April, 2017 04:25\n-\nComments\nFoxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer best known as the maker of iPhones and iPads for Apple, is said to be preparing a US$27 billion bid to acquire Toshiba's computer chip assets.\nToshiba is most commonly recognized for making NAND flash and memory chips, with all of its factories in Japan. However, chip manufacturing in Japan has slipped as rivals in South Korea and China gain in strength.\nThe news of the potential offer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Foxconn is the latest of a number of companies, including SK Hynix and equity investor Silver Lake, interested in acquiring Toshiba's chip assets.\nAn acquisition by Foxconn would give Toshiba the scale it needs to advance in the manufacturing of memory and storage. Toshiba is lagging behind Samsung, especially in storage, and hasn't advanced its manufacturing processes as quickly.\nToshiba storage products can be purchased directly, but it also supplies and makes flash products for other hardware companies. The divestiture of its manufacturing assets could have an impact on SanDisk, which is a part of Toshiba.\nIn February, Toshiba said it was looking to sell its memory business. The need to sell the assets amplified after its Westinghouse Electric nuclear power unit filed for bankruptcy in late March.

HP regained the top spot this quarter boosted by strong laptop shipments worldwide. Now the question remains if HP can hold the spot.\nA separate survey released by Gartner put Lenovo as the world's top PC maker. The numbers of IDC and Gartner don't match as the two firms measure PC shipments in different ways. For example, Gartner does not account for Chromebook shipments in its survey.\nAccording to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments totaled 62.2 million units for the first quarter, down by 2.4 percent.\nNevertheless, the analyst firms agreed that PC shipments were held back by rising prices, which happened due to a shortage of NAND and DRAM. Prices of the components are expected to rise even more in the coming quarters, which could affect PC prices.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-11T18:54:00Z", "images": []}

For Apple, it suggests doubt about the iPhone\u2019s ability to remain a prestige product without\u00a0the chipmaker\u2019s wireless technology.\n\u201cThe war between the companies appears to be growing,\u201d Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday.\nApple says Qualcomm uses market dominance to illegally overcharge for its wireless technology while Qualcomm\u00a0argues the iPhone maker is just trying to pay less. The dispute is already threatening Qualcomm\u2019s earnings because contract manufacturers that make the iPhone and pay Qualcomm on behalf of Apple are holding back payments, Rasgon noted.\u00a0\nQualcomm fell 2.1 percent, the most in more than two months, to $55.35 in New York.\u00a0That extended Qualcomm\u2019s loss of market value to almost $14 billion since Apple filed its complaint Jan. 20.\u00a0While Apple has surged in the period on optimism about new iPhones coming later this year, the stock slipped 1.1 percent to $141.63 on Tuesday.\nWhile the iPhone was taking the world by storm, the partnership served both well. Qualcomm revenue reached $24 billion last year, from $15 billion when it first began supplying chips to\nApple in 2011. In that year, iPhones generated $46 billion in\nsales for Apple. That soared to $137 billion by Apple\u2019s latest fiscal year.\nBut in 2016, iPhone unit shipments dropped for the first time, making the company focus more on profitability, not just growth. Apple pressured suppliers more to save money, and its battle with Qualcomm is the toughest of these tense negotiations. The two companies accuse each other of lying, bullying and other allegedly illegal practices. Underpinning it all is a dispute over licensing fees that make Qualcomm one of the world\u2019s most profitable chipmakers and shave a few percentage points off Apple\u2019s iPhone margins.\n\u201cApple has built the most profitable company in the world, relying heavily on Qualcomm\u2019s patented technologies,\u201d Qualcomm wrote in Monday\u2019s court filing. \u201cApple achieved its success without contributing much, if anything, to the innovations at the heart of cellular communications.\u201d\nApple says Qualcomm is abusing its strength as the major provider of smartphone chips and related patents to suppress competition and extract billions of dollars in licensing fees it doesn\u2019t deserve.\nWhile Apple usually taps multiple suppliers or makes components itself, the modem -- a chip that performs the crucial function of connecting a phone to the network and the internet -- is Qualcomm\u2019s preserve. Until 2016, Apple had used the San Diego, California-based company\u2019s parts exclusively for several years.\nBecoming reliant on Apple has been a tough lesson for some companies.\nDialog Semiconductor Plc\u2019s shares fell the most in more than 16 years on Tuesday after an analyst warned Apple will cut back on the use of the company\u2019s power-management chips. Earlier this month, Imagination Technologies Group Plc shares plunged as much as 69 percent after the U.K. chip designer said Apple will stop using its intellectual property in new products. When Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s Galaxy phones became the main rival of the iPhone, Apple switched manufacturing of its processors from Samsung to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\nShedding Qualcomm may be harder. When Apple put the iPhone 7 on sale last year it tried to muzzle its main modem supplier, according Qualcomm\u2019s filing made late Monday. The reason: some versions of the flagship smartphone weren\u2019t using Qualcomm modem chips. Apple worried that comparisons between Qualcomm iPhones and ones using Intel Corp. modems would cause problems.\nApple told Qualcomm to avoid public bake offs between the two flavors of the phone, threatened to use its marketing muscle to attack Qualcomm, and warned that its status as a supplier would be in doubt, according to Monday\u2019s filing.\nIn November, Bloomberg News\nreported that Apple\u2019s decision to use different modems for the iPhone 7 caused the Intel version of the device to perform worse than the Qualcomm model. Apple said at the time there was \"no discernible difference\" in the wireless performance of any models.\nQualcomm, which owns patents that cover the fundamentals of modern mobile technology, charges phone makers a slice of the selling price of handsets, regardless of whether they use its chips or not. Apple whispered in the ear of regulators around the world, accusing it of misusing this powerful market position, Qualcomm said in its Monday suit. That resulted in antitrust cases, from\nSouth Korea to the U.S., that threaten to curtail this licensing business.\u00a0\nAccording to Apple\u2019s own suit, filed in December, it\u2019s owed billions of dollars it was overcharged in \u201cQualcomm\u2019s illegal scheme\u201d to control the market for mobile phone chips. On Tuesday, an Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond earlier statements on the suit.\nQualcomm sees the fight as a commercial negotiation over licensing fees, but on legal steroids. It still thinks that there\u2019s another way, if Apple acknowledges the role of its technology and pays up.\n\u201cThe second way things like this are resolved is through discussions and business resolutions,\u201d said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019d prefer not to have disputes.\u201d\n( Updates with share performance in fifth paragraph.)\nPublished on\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-11T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Recent reports have suggested that Apple might have secured the majority of Samsung's OLED output for the next two years, which leaves Google with no choice but to try and switch to another display provider.\nLG has worked with Mountain View on the Nexus phone and is planning to start full-scale OLED panel production by the end of 2017, so a potential big-money investment aligns with the company's interests.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-11T07:30:00Z", "images": []}

The announcement sent BlackBerry shares up as much as 19 percent in New York, the most intraday since January 2015.\nThe refund from Qualcomm will boost BlackBerry\u2019s cash hoard, which stood at $1.7 billion at the end of its fiscal fourth quarter, helping CEO John Chen as he spends more money to shift the company\u2019s focus to software and security-focused products. BlackBerry no longer makes the phones that used Qualcomm technology and argued that it was due a refund after sales collapsed.\n\u201cWith BlackBerry planning to invest for growth in its software businesses, the surprising arbitration award and $815 million in cash from Qualcomm will bolster BlackBerry\u2019s balance sheet and increase the likelihood of acquisitions to augment growth,\u201d Canaccord Genuity technology analyst Michael Walkley wrote Wednesday in a report. He raised his price target on BlackBerry to $9.50 from $8.\nQualcomm, which owns patents that cover the fundamentals of modern mobile technology, gets a cut of the selling price of handsets from phone makers, whether they use its chips or not. The San Diego-based semiconductor maker gets the majority of its profit from those license payments.\nIn 2010, before its smartphone business collapsed, Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry signed a nonrefundable agreement with Qualcomm covering royalty payments through 2015, Walkley said in his note. It shipped far fewer phones than it expected, leading it to seek a refund on some of the payments, he wrote.\nThe chipmaker, the biggest producer of semiconductors that run smartphones, faces the refund bill while trying to fend off multiple lawsuits and regulatory actions targeting its lucrative licensing business. Earlier this week, it counter-sued Apple, one of its biggest customers, escalating a fight in which it\u2019s accused of illegally trying to maintain a stranglehold over the market for phone components. Qualcomm countered that Apple is behind a global push to break the chipmaker\u2019s business model because the iPhone maker wants to pay lower fees.\nQualcomm on Wednesday said it disagreed with the outcome of the arbitration proceeding with BlackBerry, but noted the decision is binding and can\u2019t be appealed.\n\u201cThe arbitration decision was limited to prepayment provisions unique to BlackBerry\u2019s license agreement with Qualcomm and has no impact on agreements with any other licensee,\u201d the company said.\nQualcomm has been battling other smartphone makers over royalty fees, from Apple to LG Electronics. The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating Qualcomm for unfairly cutting out competitors and forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively. In December, South Korea\u2019s antitrust regulator slapped a record $902 million fine on the chipmaker for violating antitrust laws.\nBlackBerry, following the cash award, said it will continue to work with Qualcomm.\n\u201cBlackBerry and Qualcomm have a longstanding relationship and continue to be valued technology partners,\u201d Chen said in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased the arbitration panel ruled in our favor and look forward to collaborating with Qualcomm in security for ASICs and solutions for the automotive industry.\u201d\nThe final amount of the award, including interest and attorney fees, will be announced after a hearing on May 30, BlackBerry said.\nMore Business News\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-12T18:08:37Z", "images": []}
{"title": "Apple Clips scored up to 1 million downloads in its first 4 days", "content": "Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 2 years\nIn its first four days on the market, Apple\u2019s\u00a0new social video editing app Clips reached between 500,000 and a million downloads, according to estimates\u00a0from app store analytics firm App Annie. However, despite heavy press coverage and featured positions in the App Store, Clips hasn\u2019t yet broken into the top 20 apps by ranking in the U.S. App Store\u2019s Top Charts.\nThe day after its debut on Thursday , the app climbed to No. 28 in the App Store, its highest rank so far, per App Annie\u2019s data. To put that in perspective, Apple\u2019s Music Memos app \u2013 a fairly niche app aimed at musicians \u2013 reached No. 29 that day.\nMusic Memos, we should note, no longer registers on the Top Overall Charts, as App Annie doesn\u2019t track rankings below No. 1750.\nBut according to data from two firms, Sensor Tower and App Annie, Clips already\u00a0beat Music Memos in terms of downloads, if not rankings.\nAnother point of comparison for Clips is Instagram\u2019s Layout. While the former is focused on video and the latter is for photos, both apps are broadly\u00a0about editing media for the purpose of social sharing. During Clips\u2019 first four days, it was ranking in the No. 5 to No. 6 range in the competitive Photo & Video category on the App Store, while Instagram\u2019s Layout was in the No. 17 to No. 35 range, and as low as 80, in its first days, App Annie said.\nBut Clips is slipping in the U.S. charts already. Over its\u00a0launch\u00a0weekend \u2013 a time when\u00a0the app could have gotten a boost from curious users looking to play with Apple\u2019s latest toy \u2013 Clips instead continued to drop. By Saturday, it was No. 39 in the U.S. By Sunday, 40. Today, it\u2019s 53.\nU.S. rankings don\u2019t tell the full story of downloads, of course \u2013 Clips is available worldwide. But in this case,\u00a0the U.S. accounts for around a quarter of its total downloads, so its performance in this market matters.\nThe U.S. is currently the\u00a0largest market for Clips downloads (25% share), says\u00a0App Annie, followed by China (roughly 16%), with Japan, Russia and Hong Kong rounding out the top five.\n\u00a0\nBeyond Clips\u00a0simply being a new app from Apple, the app\u00a0will ultimately succeed or fail based on its ability to tap into the network effects that come with social sharing.\n\u201cThe average user is not yet aware of it,\u201d notes Danielle Levitas, Senior Vice President, Research & Professional Services at App Annie.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ll start to become more aware of it through that\u00a0network effect as people share these clips in Facebook, in Instagram, in WeChat,\u201d she says. Clips does not have its own built in social network, so it will rely on these shares.\n\u201cThe question for Apple will be not only where this is in terms of downloads \u2013 which is obviously important when a new app launches \u2013 but\u2026what is the network effect?,\u201d says\u00a0Levitas.\nThose effects will be tied to Apple\u2019s ability to get the app onto people\u2019s devices. In this area, it has an advantage: it owns the platform. With a 42 percent share of smart devices in the U.S. and the App Store as the\u00a0single point of entry to the world of mobile applications, Apple can heavily promote its own apps if it chooses. And it certainly is doing so with Clips.\nThe company placed Clips in featured banners both on the homepage and in the Photo & Video\u00a0category page\u00a0in its App Store, and it gave Clips the number one position\u00a0on Apple\u2019s\u00a0\u201cNew apps we love\u201d list.\nPlus, there\u2019s the accompanying onslaught of press coverage from not only the typical array of technology news sites and Apple blogs, but also a slew of mainstream media outlets like The Wall St. Journal , Reuters , Time , CNN , CNBC , and many others. It\u2019s kind of impossible to not know that Apple launched a new app, if you spend any time online at all.\nThat being said, not all iOS device owners read the news, or launch the App Store regularly.\nIt seems like Clips is catching on with those who\u2019ve tried it, however, leading to a 4-star rating and many rave reviews on the App Store. The app\u00a0seems to appeal to those who are already familiar with video editing, and find Clips to be a less bloated alternative to iMovie for iOS. But those with less experience complained\u00a0the app doesn\u2019t feel that intuitive or has poor navigational elements, among other things.\nAs TechCrunch\u2019s own review noted, many of Clips\u2019\u00a0features are buried, with the goal of keeping it simple. This could have the side effect of\u00a0making them hard to find. And\u00a0 it\u2019s clear\u00a0not everyone agrees that Apple has built a straightforward app. The user interface is not as simple\u00a0as it could be , some reviewers said, leading to a bit of learning curve to getting the hang of it. These are areas Apple may need to iterate upon in the future.\nIn the meantime, Apple could\u00a0gain real-world insight into what people want to do with their videos. Eventually, it could choose to\u00a0port a feature or two from Clips \u2013 like its filters, overlays or other live editing tools\u00a0\u2013 to its main Camera app.\nBut Clips\u2019\u00a0real test won\u2019t be rankings or downloads, but\u00a0in the number of clips the app ends up producing, and their distribution. Those numbers won\u2019t be visible for at least a month out from launch, at the earliest.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-11T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

A fun and easy way to quickly get in touch with friends and family, this new watch-to-watch connection is fast, personal and can be activated between any compatible Apple Watch users around the world over Wi-Fi or cellular. 1\nApple Podcasts\nThe popular Apple Podcasts app comes to Apple Watch.\nUsers can now listen to their favorite podcasts on the go with Apple Podcasts on Apple Watch and stream any podcast in the catalog by using Siri. Episodes will automatically sync to Apple Watch, and as they\u2019re listened to on other devices, the app will automatically refresh with the latest episode. A new feature for developers allows music, audiobooks and meditation sessions from apps such as Pandora, Audible and 10% Happier to be synced to Apple Watch for playback offline without the user\u2019s iPhone nearby.\nSiri Updates\nThe Siri watch face shows actionable content from favorite third-party apps such as Citymapper and Nike+ Run Club.\nUsing machine learning, the updated Siri watch face on Apple Watch is an even better personal assistant. It now offers more predictive and proactive shortcuts throughout the day based on routines, locations and information such as heart rate after a workout, commute time with Maps at the appropriate time of day or sports scores for a favorite team. The Siri watch face will also show actionable content from favorite third-party apps such as Nike+ Run Club, Glow Baby and Mobike.\nEnhanced Notifications\nNotifications from third-party apps can now have interactive controls and be used without needing to open the app; for example, a Yelp reservation notification will have the option to modify the time or change the number of guests right from the notification.\nStudent ID Cards\nApple Watch can now be used in place of Student ID cards.\nWith watchOS 5, Apple Watch replaces Student ID cards. With a raise of the wrist, students can gain access to places including the library, dorms and events, and pay for snacks, laundry and dinners around campus simply by adding their ID cards to Wallet on Apple Watch. The program launches with Duke, the University of Alabama and the University of Oklahoma this fall. Johns Hopkins University, Santa Clara University and Temple University will bring the capability by the end of the year.\nPride and Summer Bands\nThree new Sport Band colors are available today in Peach, Marine Green and Sky Blue.\nApple also today released a new watch face to celebrate Pride, which Apple Watch users can download from the Face Gallery in the Apple Watch app. The Pride Edition Woven Nylon band is updated with a new rainbow stripe with a donation being made to the following LGBTQ advocacy organizations: Gender Spectrum, GLSEN, ILGA, PFLAG, The National Center for Transgender Equality and The Trevor Project.

{"title": "Fitbit Is Entering New, Dangerous Waters As Consumers Turn To Smartwatches", "content": "The company is building its first real smartwatch after slowly adding smartwatch features to its fitness trackers. And things aren\u2019t going smoothly.\n[Photos: courtesy of Fitbit]\nBy Mark Sullivan\n4 minute Read\nNot too long ago, most consumers were satisfied that simple fitness trackers, not smartwatches, were a good way to enter the age of the \u201c quantified self .\u201d Sales of Fitbit\u2019s trackers flourished, and the company held a successful IPO .\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nBut times have changed, the numbers show . More fitness-minded people are moving to smartwatches, mainly the Apple Watch. Fitbit, which is now working on a full-fledged smartwatch of its own, may find this a dangerous era in which to live.\nIn the run-up to the launch of the Apple Watch back in 2014, Fitbit CEO James Park got the same question a lot: How are you going to compete? The assumption was that Apple would deliver a beautiful device that did everything a Fitbit did and much more.\nPark didn\u2019t seem concerned in the least. He argued, rightly at the time, that fitness trackers and smartwatches were different things, and that there was lots of room in the market for both.\nAfter launching in April 2015, Apple Watch didn\u2019t exactly set the world on fire sales-wise in the first year. Apple didn\u2019t disclose numbers, but most estimates put the number between 10 million to 15 million units. Many consumers continued to be happy with fitness trackers that did a small set of things (like counting steps and monitoring sleep) and that cost well under $200.\u00a0Fitbit sales remained strong heading into the company\u2019s June 2015 IPO and beyond.\nBut now, a quarter and change into 2017, Fitbit\u2019s situation isn\u2019t looking as good. Sales began to soften during 2016. The company cut its full-year revenue guidance back 8% midway through the year. It also reduced its unit sales forecast for the 2016 holiday quarter (its stock taking a hammering ), and ended up selling 6.5 million trackers during the period. Revenue fell 19%. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch has its biggest quarter ever, selling an estimated 5.6 million devices.\nadvertisement\nCEO Park attributed the lull to the mass market adoption curve: \u201c. . . we have successfully captured a large portion of the innovator and early adopter segments in tracker market,\u201d he said during a recent earnings call. \u201cWe believe the early and late majority segments of the tracker market represents an additional significant target opportunity of between 40 million to 80 million new tracker customers.\u201d\nApple made some important choices in last fall\u2019s Apple Watch Series 2 to promote that mind-set. It noticeably shifted both the feature set and the marketing of the second version of the Watch to target the fitness crowd: The new device became officially waterproof (for swimmers) and added GPS (to track runs). There was even a new Nike+ Watch with special fitness bands and additional run-tracking software on board. The Watch\u2019s message notifications and other communications features were downplayed.\nThe migration from pure fitness trackers toward smartwatches is nothing new to Fitbit. Like its competitors, the company\u00a0has gradually added smartwatch-like features to its trackers, such as smartphone integration features including message notifications and music control. It introduced heart-rate sensors to its devices beginning with the Charge HR in early 2015.\nFitbit Blaze\nWhat should Fitbit do now? Well, if it buys the argument that the gravity in the wearables space is heading toward the smartwatch, it should release a real smartwatch, with all the trimmings, ASAP.\nVoila! Company executives acknowledged late last month that they are indeed building a full-fledged smartwatch to compete for the same consumers who might buy an Apple Watch. The device reportedly offers GPS, heart-rate monitoring, mobile payments, four days of battery life, a color display with 1,000 nits of brightness (like the Apple Watch 2), and a $300 price tag.\nThat\u2019s all great, but the context in which Fitbit is doing all this is, well, not ideal. The company is trying to grow from a fitness tracker company into a smartwatch maker just as the Apple Watch is gaining strength and as Fitbit sales are slowing. While Apple has successfully positioned the Watch as a fitness tracker that\u2019s also a full-on smartwatch, Fitbit is just now trying to build its first real smartwatch. I\u2019d much rather be Apple in that scenario.\nadvertisement\nFitbit Blaze\nAn April 11 article by Yahoo Finance\u2018s JP Mangalindan cites sources saying Fitbit wanted to release its new smartwatch this spring but has delayed launch until the fall because of production\u00a0problems. From the report:\n\u201cIn one of the more final prototypes, the GPS wasn\u2019t working because the antennae wasn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d one of those sources told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThey had to go back to the drawing board to redesign the product so the GPS got a strong signal.\u201d\nYahoo Finance\u2018s story also reports that Fitbit is having trouble making the device waterproof, as the Apple Watch 2 is. It\u2019s still unclear if Fitbit will be able to get these issues solved before it\u2019s time to launch this fall.\n\u201cRegardless of whether Fitbit manages to make it waterproof, I think they have to release the watch later this year,\u201d one of Yahoo Finance\u2018s sources said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally sink or swim time for them.\u201d\nFirst Generation vs. Third Generation\nIf Fitbit launches its first real smartwatch in the fall, it will probably debut at roughly the same time Apple will announce its third smartwatch\u2014likely called the Apple Watch Series 3 . And based on the Yahoo Finance report, it sounds like Fitbit, in the best case scenario, will be releasing a smartwatch with a feature set comparable to that of last year\u2019s Apple Watch 2.\nAnd finally, Yahoo Finance\u2018s sources say the Fitbit smartwatch will use the same squarish hardware design as last year\u2019s aesthetically challenged Fitbit Blaze . Competing with Apple on hardware design is already a daunting\u00a0challenge; if Fitbit recycles a lackluster design from last year for its new device, it suggests\u00a0to me that the company has chosen\u00a0to simply cede the beauty crown to Apple.\nadvertisement\nFitbit stock fell 2% on the Yahoo Finance report of smartwatch production delays. But these technical hiccups are just a small symptom of a much larger challenge. Fitbit, which is now 10 years old, may be\u00a0dealing with the growing pains of becoming a smartwatch company.\nadvertisement\n", "language": "en", "date": "2017-04-12T23:58:41Z", "images": []}

Apple, meanwhile, has been focusing on the iPad in the classroom.\nThen again, perhaps there will be word of a fancier Microsoft Surface Book laptop whose screen isn\u2019t detachable.\nIn the past few years Microsoft, Google, and Apple have all come out with classroom software, and Microsoft could provide updates on the Microsoft Classroom component of Office 365 Education.

{"title": "Apple opens Health Records API to developers", "content": "Apple\nApple opens Health Records API to developers\nApps Empowering Consumers to Manage Medications, Diseases, Nutrition and More Coming This Fall\nThe Medisafe app will integrate with Apple\u2019s Health Records API to help consumers keep track of medications and learn about harmful drug-drug interactions.\nToday Apple delivered a Health Records API for developers and researchers to create an ecosystem of apps that use health record data to better manage medications, nutrition plans, diagnosed diseases and more. The Health Records feature allows patients of more than 500 hospitals and clinics to access medical information from various institutions organized into one view on their iPhone. For the first time, consumers will be able to share medical records from multiple hospitals with their favorite trusted apps, helping them improve their overall health.\n\u201cMedical information may be the most important personal information to a consumer, and offering access to Health Records was the first step in empowering them. Now, with the potential of Health Records information paired with HealthKit data, patients are on the path to receiving a holistic view of their health,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWith the Health Records API open to our incredible community of developers and researchers, consumers can personalize their health needs with the apps they use every day.\u201d\nHealth Records data is encrypted on iPhone and protected with the consumer\u2019s iPhone passcode. When consumers choose to share their health record data with trusted apps, the data flows directly from HealthKit to the third-party app and is not sent to Apple\u2019s servers.\nPatients of more than 500 hospitals and clinics can access their medical records in one view.\nDevelopers building health apps can individualize experiences, with the user\u2019s permission, based on the user\u2019s unique health history across key categories, including:\nMedication Tracking: Medisafe, a medication management app, will connect with the Health Records feature so consumers can easily import their prescription list without manual entry, quickly enabling pill reminders and allowing the user to receive relevant medication information. Medisafe will be able to warn patients of problematic drug-drug interactions because they have the comprehensive view of the patient\u2019s exact medication list from several hospitals and clinics.\nDisease Management: A diabetes app could access a patient\u2019s lab results from their Health Records as well as their diet and exercise details through the existing iOS HealthKit integration, allowing for a more complete picture of the consumer and the best ways to encourage them to stay on track.\nNutrition Planning: A healthy eating app could offer consumers tailored programs based on their high blood pressure or cholesterol results by serving up low salt or high fiber meal plans.\nMedical Research: With the new Health Records API, doctors can integrate patient medical data into their ResearchKit study apps for a more complete view of their participants\u2019 health background. Traditionally, researchers used arduous survey questionnaires to determine pre-existing conditions, which puts the burden on the patient to remember the details. Now, with the participants\u2019 approval, researchers can access that patient-specific information to ensure more comprehensive research. This integration continues Apple\u2019s commitment to providing the medical community with ResearchKit tools that could further their discoveries.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2018-06-04T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

Safari now also presents simplified system information when users browse the web, preventing them from being tracked based on their system configuration. Safari now also automatically creates, autofills and stores strong passwords when users create new online accounts and flags reused passwords so users can change them.

{"title": "The App Store turns 10", "content": "Apple\nThe App Store turns 10\nHow Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ignited a Worldwide App Phenomenon\nIn 10 years, the App Store has transformed how people live, work and play.\nWhen Apple introduced the App Store on July 10, 2008 with 500 apps, it ignited a cultural, social and economic phenomenon that changed how people work, play, meet, travel and so much more. Over the past decade, the App Store has created a safe place for users of all ages to get the very best apps and a vibrant app economy for developers of all sizes, from all over the world, to thrive. Today, customers in 155 countries are visiting the App Store more often, staying longer and downloading and using more apps than ever before.\nWhile there have been many notable moments since apps first came to iPhone and later iPad, the milestones and testimonials below reflect some of the most significant over the past 10 years \u2014 defining how the App Store democratized software distribution and transformed how we live every day.\nI. The App Store Opens Doors for Developers, Puts an All New Experience in the Hands of Customers\nThe App Store provides a groundbreaking solution for developers to distribute their software and consumers to experience apps like never before.\nPhil Schiller, senior vice president, Worldwide Marketing, Apple: \u201cIn its first decade, the App Store has surpassed all of our wildest expectations \u2014 from the innovative apps that developers have dreamed up, to the way customers have made apps part of their daily lives \u2014 and this is just the beginning. We could not be more proud of what developers have created and what the next 10 years have in store.\u201d\nMarco Arment, developer of Overcast and longtime iOS developer: \u201cSince day one, the App Store has been by far the easiest way for developers to reach the most people with our apps. It eliminated the friction and overhead of setting up our own distribution and payment systems, making development far more accessible to everyone and letting us focus on our true passion: making the best apps we can. Over its 10 years so far, the App Store has developed into the richest, most diverse, and most accessible software ecosystem the world has ever seen.\u201d\nChad Evans, senior vice president, Product Development, Major League Baseball: \u201dThere was an incredible sense of anticipation and excitement the day the App Store launched, and getting to see MLB At Bat listed among the first 500 apps, but we don\u2019t think anyone realized then the immense impact these apps would have on the ways fans experience sports. We feel fortunate to be part of the historic growth of the App Store these last 10 years. It\u2019s exciting to think what opportunities the next 10 will bring as we continue working with Apple to connect fans more closely to their favorite teams and the game of baseball.\u201d\nThe App Store immediately delivered a magical experience to customers from its first iteration in 2008, putting an entirely new world of software in their hands.\nBefore 2008, the software industry was dominated by a few large companies. The App Store opened the door for any developer, from one-person shops to large studios, to come up with a great idea, build a high quality app and seamlessly deliver it to the growing number of customers around the world.\nMLB At Bat, Tap Tap Revenge, Trism, The New York Times, eBay and Travelocity represented the wide range of apps available from day one, bringing to life an entirely new way to travel, play games, read the news and experience sports right in the palm of your hand.\nProtecting user privacy is paramount in the Apple ecosystem, so from the beginning, Apple has taken great care in providing clear guidelines to developers and thoughtfully curating a safe, trusted app marketplace to ensure the best experience possible for customers around the world to discover and access apps.\nII. Mobile-First Businesses Thrive\nThe App Store propelled new industries and changed how customers interact with businesses and start-ups like Calm.\nKeith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova, founders of Imangi Studios, creators of Temple Run: \u201cThe App Store and iPhone changed our lives. Our first game, Imangi, launched the day the App Store opened. Fast forward 10 years, and we\u2019ve created over 10 games, including Temple Run, which has been downloaded over a BILLION times. Our studio has grown from the two of us to a team of 35. None of this would have been possible without the App Store.\u201d\nThe cutting-edge hardware and quickly evolving software from Apple, combined with creative ideas from developers who saw the potential of iPhone being in customers\u2019 pockets, spawned new industries that would forever change how people live, work and play \u2014 a revolution that continues today.\nStart-ups including Instagram, Calm, Uber and Instacart embraced features like the iPhone camera, Apple Pay, GPS and Location Services to deliver on-demand and personalized experiences, with many creating billion dollar businesses that started with apps in the App Store. At the same time, both traditional companies and those that started as websites, such as Twitter, Facebook, eBay, Yelp, Airbnb and Amazon, began building apps to meet changing customer behavior.\nAs a result, apps have become one of the most important ways that customers interact with businesses and tackle everyday tasks \u2014 whether it is to book a flight or hotel room, make a dinner reservation, shop for gifts or pay bills.\nIII.\u00a0 Gaming Takes Off, Reaches New Fans\nThe App Store is the most popular marketplace for games, offering everything from new and original genres to beloved favorites such as Pok\u00e9mon Go.\nShigeru Miyamoto, representative director and fellow, Nintendo: \u201cWe are very happy that we are able to deliver Super Mario Run, a new Super Mario experience that could be played with just one hand on iPhone, to hundreds of millions of consumers because of the App Store. The App Store allows us to share the joy of Nintendo games with many new audiences, and we will continue striving to provide unique and new game experiences to App Store customers.\u201d\nRiccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, creators of Candy Crush: \u201cWe launched Candy Crush Saga on the App Store over five years ago and it\u2019s been hugely beneficial, allowing us to reach a brand new global audience. Our games have been played in all seven continents, including Antarctica! That shows just how influential and far-reaching the App Store has become.\u201d\nDaniel Wu, president of Hero Entertainment, creators of Red Tides: \u201cThe App Store offers us the opportunity to bring great eSports experiences from desktop to mobile and let the game fans and players meet online to offline and thoroughly enjoy the charm of games and even establish new ways to socialize.\u201d\nThe App Store brought gaming mainstream, thanks to the easy Multi-Touch technology on iPhone and iPad and the convenience of playing on the go. Customers were drawn to early titles like Super Monkey Ball, PAC-MAN, Angry Birds, Words With Friends, Real Racing and Temple Run, leading iOS to become the most popular gaming platform in the world.\nGames such as Heads Up!, Pok\u00e9mon Go, HQ and Fortnite have created communal, cultural moments around the world, while new technologies have brought console quality games to mobile, including Vainglory, The Witness and Arena of Valor.\nIV. In-App Purchase, Subscriptions Unlock Experiences\nIn-app purchase allows developers to offer apps for free, so customers can try them out before paying to unlock additional functionalities, while subscriptions in apps like Headspace also help customers get access to new features.\nHorace Dediu, analyst, Asymco: \u201cThe App Store completely changed the way people access and pay for software and services. Only through the power of a software ecosystem can subscriptions emerge and grow to such a level. The App Store created a means for others to become successful \u2014 many more than could possibly be imagined in ways that could not possibly be imagined \u2014 and freed people to be creative in unforeseen dimensions.\u201d\nWith the introduction of in-app purchase (IAP) in 2009, customers could download an app and then pay to unlock different levels and functionality, allowing more people to experience new apps before committing to buying them. By June 2010, $1 billion would be paid out to developers from IAP and paid apps.\nIn 2011, the App Store started supporting subscription apps, and by 2016, had expanded support to all 25 of its categories, including Games, Kids and Health and Fitness. Over 28,000 iOS apps now offer subscriptions, including Netflix, iQiYi, Tinder, LinkedIn, Sing! By Smule, Headspace and Dropbox, making it easy for millions of new customers to instantly discover and sign up for or unsubscribe from these services. Subscriptions are up 95 percent from last year, and as of June 2018, developers have earned over $100 billion from the App Store.\nV. Streaming Entertainment Takes Off\nMore customers are watching TV shows, movies and video on the go.\nRichard Plepler, chairman and CEO, HBO: \u201cWhen we decided to introduce HBO NOW, there was never a question that our exclusive launch partner had to be Apple. Announcing the streaming service with Apple and the arrival of HBO NOW on the App Store is one of the most significant moments in HBO\u2019s storied history.\u201d\nThe App Store has been the epicenter of a mobile video consumption boom. The larger screen sizes and resolution of iPhone and iPad have made customers more comfortable watching video on the go, while services including HBO NOW, Hulu, Netflix and Sling TV and the abundance of quality shows allow customers to enjoy the entertainment they love when and where they choose.\nVI. Creativity, Productivity and Education Soar Beyond Office, Classroom Walls\nCreativity, productivity and educational apps enable customers to learn in fun, engaging ways.\nJames Cuda, founder and CEO of Savage Interactive, creators of Procreate: \u201cFrom the beginning, we wanted to sell Procreate exclusively through the App Store because it allows us to reach customers everywhere, making it easy to provide new features, respond to feedback and ensure artists are getting the best possible experience. Being a part of the App Store\u2019s journey has been life-changing, as millions of our customers are discovering digital art creation for the first time, while many industry-leading artists find Procreate with iPad Pro and Apple Pencil to be a powerful combination. Procreate simply would not be possible without the App Store.\u201d\nYan Lin, CEO of Dr. Panda, developer of popular kids games: \u201cThanks to the incredible opportunities brought by the App Store, Dr. Panda has transformed from a small Chinese startup to a global kids brand loved by both children and parents with 50 million downloads around the world in only six years.\u201d\nIn 2010, iPad introduced a giant canvas with new possibilities for customers to create and learn. Professionals around the world are choosing iPad Pro to explore new levels of creativity and productivity, thanks to its portability and versatility, and learners of all levels embrace iPad as a tool for work and play. Today, customers can enjoy more than 1.3 million apps designed specifically for iPad, including Procreate, Lightroom, Microsoft Office 365 and Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Template \u2014 which allow for creativity on the go, beyond office or studio walls, or wherever inspiration may strike.\nWith over 200,000 educational and reference apps like Explain Everything and The Elements from Touch Press, iPad has helped nurture rich, engaging ways to learn, express creativity and encourage collaboration. Additionally, education apps such as Froggipedia, WWF Free Rivers and Boulevard AR have quickly embraced augmented reality (AR) to make the learning experience even more immersive for students.\nVII. Health, Fitness and Wellness Apps Surge in Popularity\nFitness apps like Sweat encourage iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch users to stay active and live healthier lives.\nTobi Pearce, CEO and founder of Sweat, a fitness app and community for women, and Kayla Itsines, co-creator of BBG Guide and Sweat Trainer: \u201cThe App Store provides Sweat the ability to reach and improve the lives of millions of people around the world through health and fitness, building a bigger community and offering flexibility in when, where and how users work out. Being a part of the Apple ecosystem has brought continued growth opportunities that have fundamentally changed the trajectory of our organization.\u201d\nFrancoise A. Marvel, MD, Corrie Health Team, Johns Hopkins, Cardiology: \u201cOver the last 10 years, the App Store has contributed to the advancement of innovation in patient care by creating a platform for state-of-the-art medical apps like Corrie at Johns Hopkins. Our mobile health research relies on the App Store to deliver life-saving and life-changing apps to our patients.\u201d\nApple Watch and HealthKit paved the way for developers to make health, fitness and wellness apps more innovative, intelligent and interactive, which in turn have inspired customers to be more active and mindful of their health. Downloads for these apps have increased 75 percent since the launch of Apple Watch, led by apps such as Zova, Nike, Lose It!, Dexcom, One Drop, Glow, 10% Happier and Yoga Glo.\nMore than 500 doctors and medical researchers have used Apple\u2019s ResearchKit and CareKit software tools for clinical studies involving 3 million participants on conditions ranging from autism and Parkinson\u2019s disease to post-surgical at-home rehabilitation and physical therapy. Thanks to these innovative tools, customers are increasingly able to use iOS and Apple Watch apps to monitor their overall health and well-being.\nVIII. Accessibility Apps Empower Communities\nAccessibility features built into iOS provide crucial support for customers with assistive needs.\nRichard Ellenson, developer and CEO, Cerebral Palsy Foundation: \u201cIn the world of assistive technology and accessibility, it\u2019s impossible to overstate the importance of the App Store. For individuals with disabilities, for professionals, family members, and anyone who\u2019s ever wondered about the potential in another person who had a bit of difference \u2014 or deeply significant challenges \u2014\u00a0the App Store has been profoundly transformational. I have seen it unleash possibility and potential in literally thousands of individuals. Yet, closest to my heart, I have seen it do so for my son: a bright, independent 20 year old who has Cerebral Palsy. My son moves about in a wheelchair, but that is simply the place from which his spirit soars. His voice comes from his iPad, he does his homework on iPad, his social life is rooted in the apps on iPad, he navigates his entertainment on iPad, and he has performed a thrilling one-man-show with his iPad. I cannot imagine my son's life without this technological magic. And I know so many others for whom this is also true. It\u2019s not a reach to say the App Store has been the single greatest advance for accessibility \u2014\u00a0ever.\u201d\nDavid Niemeijer, founder and CEO, AssistiveWare, creators of accessibility apps: \u201cThe App Store has made the world much more accessible, and made it easier for AssistiveWare to realize its vision of creating a world without communication barriers. Without it, AssistiveWare would likely still be a one-man Mac developer. Now we provide iOS communication apps to over 200,000 people worldwide, many of whom would not be able to communicate effectively without them.\u201d\nSince 2009, millions of customers have benefitted from apps such as Lyft, Twitter, Starbucks and TED that incorporate the rich accessibility features built into iOS including VoiceOver, while others like Voice Dream Reader and CP Channel have provided crucial support for communities with assistive needs. With accessibility features seamlessly woven in, these apps support more customers and lead to a more inclusive and engaging user experience.\nIX. Coding Inspires Future Generations\nStudent developers at WWDC are committed to improving their software development skills, traveling from around the world to form a unique and supportive community at the conference and beyond.\nAmanda Southworth, executive director of Astra Labs, creators of anxietyhelper and Verena: \u201cApple undoubtedly revolutionized the way developers and users connect. To this day, the App Store continues to innovate and it\u2019s in a class of its own. With the work that I'm doing in the non-profit sector, it's important that the work we do can be easily found and distributed, and that's exactly what the App Store has done. It has created opportunities that I am thankful for every day, and I'm so glad that I'm a part of the community that calls the App Store our home.\u201d\nMasako Wakamiya, developer of hinadan, based on a traditional Japanese celebration known as Doll Festival: \u201cAfter turning 82, I started thinking about making games that even seniors could enjoy. Friends taught me how to program and I created an app for iPhone. People often ask me, \u2018What made you want to do that?\u2019 Because older people tend to look backwards, I think it\u2019s better to take the leap forward, jump to new things and enrich our lives. My app supports Japanese, English and Chinese, making it possible for me to connect with people around the world through this app. Just thinking about that makes me excited. It\u2019s truly thanks to the App Store.\u201d\nEvery year, Apple hosts thousands of software developers from all over the globe to talk about the latest developments in apps at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Starting in 2013, Apple awarded scholarships to about 150 students to attend, and by 2018, that number had grown to over 350 talented students and STEM organization members from 42 different countries. Scholarship winners receive a free ticket to the conference, along with lodging and a one-year Apple Developer Program membership. Past scholarship winners have started their own STEM non-profit organizations to encourage their peers to learn coding and created apps that are tackling issues such as mental health, safety and climate change.\nApple introduced the Everyone Can Code program in 2016 to encourage learning, writing and teaching code, and today it is available to tens of millions of students around the world who can learn code, problem solve and create apps that will transform the future. Also in 2016, Apple launched Swift Playgrounds, an innovative iPad app that brings real coding concepts to life with an interactive interface for students of all ages and beginners to explore working with Apple\u2019s Swift coding language.\nX. New App Store Features Encourage Discovery\nThe new Today tab spotlights interesting app stories, while separate Apps and Games tabs make it easier for customers to dive in and discover new apps to download.\nDan Gray, head of studio, ustwo Games, creators of Monument Valley: \u201cWe built our entire team around the App Store, and we\u2019ve been able to have millions of people around the world play our games who never would have considered themselves gamers. The App Store refresh has shown players the creators behind the apps they enjoy everyday. Humanizing apps can only be a good thing and showcasing how they\u2019re made will inspire the next generation of creators from every corner of the world.\u201d\nIn 2017, Apple unveiled an all-new App Store, creating a daily destination with dedicated Games and Apps tabs for customers to find exactly what they are looking for or be inspired to try something new, and learn about the creators behind the apps they know and love. The App Store now sees 500 million weekly visitors who are spending more time discovering new apps than ever before, and hundreds of stories on the Today tab have been read by more than 1 million people.\nXI. The AR Revolution Awaits\nWith iOS 11, AR became available to hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users overnight, making it the biggest AR platform in the world.\nJohn Hanke, CEO, Niantic: \u201cWhen we founded Niantic, we set out to develop technology that would inspire people to explore their communities, exercise and have fun with friends and family out in the real world. In addition to making Pok\u00e9mon GO and Ingress easily accessible to hundreds of millions around the world, the App Store has done a fantastic job of shining a spotlight on our player communities, thoughtfully crafting stories to inform and educate our players, and making the ongoing feature rollout easy for our development team.\u201d\nAugmented reality is a transformational technology that brings virtual experiences into the real world, changing the way customers both work and play. In 2017, Apple introduced ARKit 1.0 and overnight iOS became the biggest AR platform in the world, available to hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users. Today, over 3,000 AR apps on the App Store, such as Kings of Pool, Alice in Wonderland AR Quest and Houzz, creating an even more engaging way for customers to shop, learn and play games. Apple delivered the third ARKit update to developers at WWDC in June 2018, making it possible for AR apps like LEGO to include shared experiences that allow multiple users to play a game or collaborate on projects, as well as persistent AR experiences that make it possible to start a puzzle on a table and come back to it later.\nWith Core ML, apps get smarter by quickly and intelligently understanding images, video and text to deliver new and exciting experiences. Applying stylistic filters to photos with BeCasso, adding fun effects with Snapchat, and for those with low vision, easily navigating the world around them with Seeing AI are all examples of how Core ML is put to use \u2014 all while keeping data private.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2018-07-05T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

To address this challenge, Apple launched HELO (Hybridized Emergency Location) in 2015, which estimates a mobile 911 caller\u2019s location using cell towers and on-device data sources like GPS and WiFi Access Points.\nApple today announced it will also use emergency technology company RapidSOS\u2019s Internet Protocol-based data pipeline to quickly and securely share HELO location data with 911 centers, improving response time when lives and property are at risk. RapidSOS\u2019s system will deliver the emergency location data of iOS users by integrating with many 911 centers\u2019 existing software, which rely on industry-standard protocols.\n\u201cCommunities rely on 911 centers in an emergency, and we believe they should have the best available technology at their disposal,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cWhen every moment counts, these tools will help first responders reach our customers when they most need assistance.\u201d\nIn keeping with Apple\u2019s focus on privacy, user data cannot be used for any non-emergency purpose and only the responding 911 center will have access to the user\u2019s location during an emergency call.\n\u201c911 telecommunicators do extraordinary work managing millions of emergencies with little more than a voice connection,\u201d said RapidSOS CEO, Michael Martin. \u201cWe are excited to work with Apple to provide first responders a new path for accurate, device-based caller location using transformative Next Generation 911 technology.\u201d\nThe FCC requires carriers to locate callers to within 50 meters at least 80 percent of the time by 2021. iOS location services are capable of exceeding this requirement today, even in challenging, dense, urban environments. This new feature allows Apple to make these benefits available to local 911 centers now rather than years from now.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Apple is giving 911 centers access to device-based location data via a thoroughly-tested, standards-based approach,\u201d said Rob McMullen, President of the National Emergency Number Association, the 911 Association. \u201cThis will accelerate the deployment of Next Generation 911 for everyone, saving lives and protecting property.\u201d\n\u201cThis new functionality is an example of how companies and first responders can use technology to dramatically improve public safety,\u201d said Tom Wheeler, FCC Chairman from 2013 to 2017. \u201cLives will be saved thanks to this effort by Apple and RapidSOS.\u201d\n\u201cHelping 911 services quickly and accurately assess caller location has been a major issue since my time at the FCC,\u201d said Dennis Patrick, FCC Chairman from 1987 to 1989. \u201cThis advancement from Apple and RapidSOS will be transformative for emergency response in the United States.\u201d\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s four software platforms \u2014 iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2018-06-18T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

While retaining the original iconic design, the fourth-generation Apple Watch has been refined, combining new hardware and software enhancements into a genuinely singular, unified form. The stunning display is over 30 percent larger and seamlessly integrates into the thinner, smaller case, while the new interface provides more information with richer detail. Apple Watch Series 4 with watchOS 5 brings advanced activity and communications features, along with revolutionary health capabilities, including a new accelerometer and gyroscope, which are able to detect hard falls, and an electrical heart rate sensor that can take an electrocardiogram (ECG) using the new ECG app, 1 which has been granted a De Novo classification by the FDA.\nprevious\nThe new Breathe watch face animates around the timing of a deep breath.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThe completely redesigned Apple Watch Series 4 continues to be an indispensable communication and fitness companion, and now with the addition of groundbreaking features, like fall detection and the first-ever ECG app offered directly to consumers, it also becomes an intelligent guardian for your health.\u201d\u00a0\nApple Watch with watchOS 5 is the ultimate fitness companion.\nBeginning Friday, September 14, Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS) will be available to order in 26 countries and territories and Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS + Cellular) will be available to order in 16 countries and territories. Both models will be available in stores beginning Friday, September 21.\nDesign\nApple Watch Series 4 is more than an evolution \u2014 it represents a fundamental redesign and re-engineering of Apple Watch. It\u2019s offered in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm. The speaker is 50 percent louder, optimized for phone calls, Siri and Walkie-Talkie, and the microphone has been relocated, to reduce echo for better sound quality. The device includes the next-generation S4 chip with a custom 64-bit dual-core processor, delivering twice the speed while maintaining the same all-day battery life. 2\nNew watch faces like Fire react uniquely with the curved edges.\nThe back of Apple Watch Series 4 is composed of a gorgeous black ceramic and sapphire crystal, allowing radio waves to easily pass through the front and back for better cellular service. The Digital Crown now includes haptic feedback, offering a more mechanical and responsive feel through the sensation of incremental clicks.\nprevious\nnext\nA suite of new motion faces react uniquely with the curved edges of the case.\nThe user interface is optimized for the larger display, allowing for app icons and fonts that are bigger and easier to read, while complications have been beautifully enhanced to be more precise and informative. New watch faces take full advantage of the Series 4 display, from the endlessly customizable Infograph face, to the Breathe face, where the animation is timed around a deep breath. Additionally, a suite of motion faces, including Vapor, Liquid Metal, Fire and Water react uniquely with the curved edges of the case.\u00a0\nYoga and hiking are new dedicated workout types.\nHealth\nApple Watch Series 4 enables customers to take an ECG reading right from the wrist using the new ECG app, which takes advantage of the electrodes built into the Digital Crown and new electrical heart rate sensor in the back crystal. With the app, users touch the Digital Crown and after 30 seconds, receive a heart rhythm classification. It can classify if the heart is beating in a normal pattern or whether there are signs of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), a heart condition that could lead to major health complications. All recordings, their associated classifications and any noted symptoms are stored in the Health app in a PDF that can be shared with physicians.\nprevious\nThe app can detect a heart beating in a normal pattern, or if the user shows signs of AFib.\nWith watchOS 5, Apple Watch intermittently analyzes heart rhythms in the background and sends a notification if an irregular heart rhythm such as AFib is detected. 3\u00a0 It can also alert the user if the heart rate exceeds or falls below a specified threshold.\nFall detection utilizes a next-generation accelerometer and gyroscope, which measures up to 32 g-forces, along with custom algorithms to identify when hard falls occur. By analyzing wrist trajectory and impact acceleration, Apple Watch sends the user an alert after a fall, which can be dismissed or used to initiate a call to emergency services. If Apple Watch senses immobility for 60 seconds after the notification, it will automatically call emergency services and send a message along with location to emergency contacts.\nApple Watch Series 4 can detect hard falls and if required, initiate a call to emergency services.\nFitness\nWith watchOS 5, Apple Watch becomes an even better fitness and workout companion. Activity competitions allow users to challenge other Apple Watch wearers, automatic workout detection provides an alert to start a workout while giving retroactive credit, and Yoga and Hiking are new dedicated workout types that accurately track active calories burned and exercise minutes earned. Running enthusiasts can take advantage of extended battery life \u2014 which is increased to six hours \u2014 for outdoor workouts and enjoy high-performance features, including cadence for indoor and outdoor runs, pace alerts for outdoor runs and rolling mile pace, which shows pace for the immediately preceding mile.\nWith watchOS 5, users can challenge any Activity Sharing friend to a seven-day competition.\nStaying Connected\nCustomers can reach their friends with just a tap of the wrist with Walkie-Talkie, a watch-to-watch connection that is an entirely new way to communicate around the world over Wi-Fi or cellular. 4 The Siri watch face is more predictive and proactive, offering shortcuts and actionable content from favorite third-party apps. watchOS 5 also lets users listen to their favorite podcasts on the go with Apple Podcasts on Apple Watch, and stream any podcast in the catalog by using Siri. With Apple Watch Series 4, enriched complications offer a more detailed view of helpful third-party apps like Dexcom, which allows for continuous glucose monitoring, or Streaks, which shows daily progress on tasks.\u00a0\nprevious\nwatchOS 5 lets users stream any podcast from Apple Podcasts by using Siri.\nApple Watch Line-Up\nApple Watch Series 4 (GPS) starts at $399 (US) and Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS + Cellular) starts at $499, both featuring the updated design and new health features.

{"title": "iOS 12 is available today", "content": "Apple\niOS 12 is available today\nPerformance Improvements, New AR Experiences, Memoji and Screen Time Come to iPhone and iPad\nAR apps can now integrate shared experiences and persistent AR, which allow users to leave virtual objects in the real world and return to them, as is, at a later time.\niOS 12, the latest version of the most advanced mobile operating system, is designed to make everyday tasks on iPhone and iPad faster and more responsive. Available today as a free software update, iOS 12 introduces new AR experiences, fun new features like Memoji, Siri Shortcuts that open up a world of apps to work with Siri and new tools to help people reduce interruptions and manage screen time for themselves and their families.\u00a0\nAdd more personality to photos and videos in Messages and FaceTime with fun camera effects.\nFaster and More Responsive\niOS 12 brings performance improvements across the system and to more devices than any previous version, supporting back to iPhone 5s introduced in 2013. Camera launches up to 70 percent faster, the keyboard appears up to 50 percent faster and typing is more responsive. When there is a lot going on across the system, apps can launch up to twice as fast.\u00a0\nDynamic AR Experiences\niOS is the world\u2019s largest AR platform and with iOS 12, Apple continues its rapid pace of delivering major advancements with new shared AR experiences, persistent AR and more dynamic object detection and image tracking. With shared AR experiences, multiple people can play the same game or collaborate on projects like home renovations or schoolwork. Persistent AR changes the way people interact with AR apps by creating opportunities to leave virtual objects in the real world to which users can return. AR in iOS 12 is an even more realistic mix of the virtual and real world with support for image detection and tracking, making it possible to detect 3D objects and automatically apply reflections. AR files can now be viewed nearly anywhere in iOS, including apps like Messages, Safari, Mail, Files and News.\nWith iOS 12, multiple people can now play AR games or collaborate on projects together.\nMemoji and Fun Camera Effects\nNew features make communicating with friends and family from iPhone X, iPhone X R, iPhone X S and iPhone X S Max, more expressive with new Animoji and personalized Memoji characters that are customizable and fun. People can create Memoji right within Messages by choosing from a set of inclusive and diverse characteristics to form a unique personality. The existing set of Animoji also expands with ghost, koala, tiger and T. rex.\nAnimoji and Memoji now feature winks and tongue detection to capture more expressions.\nNew camera effects bring Animoji, Filters, Text and Stickers to Messages and FaceTime. Filters like comic book and watercolor add personality to photos and videos, new labels and shapes let people add captions and titles to highlight parts of an image, and stickers can be placed using iMessage sticker packs.\nMemoji are customizable and fun to create right within Messages.\nPhotos For You and More Ways to Search\nAn all-new For You tab surfaces favorite moments in one place, combining Memories and iCloud Shared Albums, and introduces sharing suggestions to makes it easier to share photos with friends. Friends who receive photos are prompted to share back any photos and videos they have from the same trip or event. Search suggestions in Photos surface the most relevant Events, People, Places, Groups, Categories and recent searches, and new search functionality lets users combine multiple search terms to find just the right photos.\nA new For You tab makes it easy to view and share favorite photos.\nScreen Time, Do Not Disturb and Notifications\nNew tools built into iOS 12 help customers understand and take control of the time they spend interacting with their iOS devices. Screen Time provides users with detailed information and tools to help them manage the time they spend with apps and websites, and better understand and control where their child spends time. Daily and weekly Activity Reports show the total time spent in individual apps, usage across categories of apps, how many notifications are received and how often iPhone or iPad are picked up. App Limits allow people to set a specific amount of time to be in an app, and a notification will display when a time limit is about to expire. Screen Time also gives parents access to their child\u2019s Activity Report right from their own iOS devices using Family Sharing in iCloud, and allows them to schedule times to limit when a child\u2019s iOS device can be used, such as during bedtime. \u00a0\nAvoid disruptions with new Do Not Disturb modes based on time, location or action.\nNew modes in Do Not Disturb automatically end based on a specified time, location or action, and Do Not Disturb during Bedtime helps people get a better night\u2019s sleep by dimming the display and hiding all notifications on the lock screen until prompted in the morning.\nTo help reduce interruptions, iOS 12 gives users more options for controlling how notifications are delivered. They can instantly manage notifications to be delivered quietly or turned off completely. Grouped notifications make it easier to view and manage multiple notifications at once.\nActivity Reports show time spent in apps, usage across categories of apps, how often a person picks up their iOS device and more tools to help manage screen time.\nSiri Shortcuts for iOS Apps\nSiri takes a major step forward with the introduction of Siri Shortcuts, allowing any app to now work with Siri. With powerful on-device intelligence, Siri learns user routines and provides suggestions at just the right time. Users can also use their voice to run any Shortcut, making it even easier to use their favorite apps. The new Shortcuts app goes even further, allowing users to create custom Shortcuts to streamline frequent tasks. Popular apps like Instacart, Kayak, Hotels.com, Tile and Lose it! support Siri Shortcuts and are available in the App Store starting today.\nAny app can now work with Siri through Siri Shortcuts, so users can say \u201ctravel plans\u201d and apps like Kayak can provide up-to-date travel information.\nPrivacy and Security\nEvery Apple product is designed to protect user privacy, and new features in iOS 12 enhance the privacy and security of our customers. In Safari, enhanced Intelligent Tracking Prevention helps block social media \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cShare\u201d buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission. Safari now also presents simplified system information when users browse the web, making it more difficult for them to be tracked based on their system configuration. Safari now also automatically creates, autofills and stores strong passwords when users create new online accounts and flags reused passwords so users can change them.\nAdditional Features\nApple Books is a new app that makes discovering and enjoying books and audiobooks effortless, thanks to the new Reading Now tab, the Book Store tab that makes it fun to browse all that Apple Books has to offer, the Library tab to easily organize one\u2019s full collection, and a dedicated Audiobooks tab.\nApple News is redesigned to make it easier to discover new channels and topics or jump straight to favorites, with a new sidebar on iPad and the Channels tab on iPhone.\u00a0\nStocks features an all-new design with a customizable watchlist that makes it easy to follow the market.

{"title": "What Businessweek got wrong about Apple", "content": "Apple\nAPPLE STATEMENT October 4, 2018\nWhat Businessweek got wrong about Apple\nThe October 8, 2018 issue of Bloomberg Businessweek incorrectly reports that Apple found \u201cmalicious chips\u201d\u00a0in servers on its network in 2015. As Apple has repeatedly explained to Bloomberg reporters and editors over the past 12 months, there is no truth to these claims.\nApple provided Bloomberg Businessweek with the following statement before their story was published:\nOver the course of the past year, Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with claims, sometimes vague and sometimes elaborate, of an alleged security incident at Apple. Each time, we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have found absolutely no evidence to support any of them. We have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses, on the record, refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg\u2019s story relating to Apple.\nOn this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, \u201chardware manipulations\u201d or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement.\nIn response to Bloomberg\u2019s latest version of the narrative, we present the following facts: Siri and Topsy never shared servers; Siri has never been deployed on servers sold to us by Super Micro; and Topsy data was limited to approximately 2,000 Super Micro servers, not 7,000. None of those servers have ever been found to hold malicious chips.\nAs a matter of practice, before servers are put into production at Apple they are inspected for security vulnerabilities and we update all firmware and software with the latest protections. We did not uncover any unusual vulnerabilities in the servers we purchased from Super Micro when we updated the firmware and software according to our standard procedures.\nWe are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg\u2019s reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed. Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple.\nWhile there has been no claim that customer data was involved, we take these allegations seriously and we want users to know that we do everything possible to safeguard the personal information they entrust to us. We also want them to know that what Bloomberg is reporting about Apple is inaccurate.\nApple has always believed in being transparent about the ways we handle and protect data. If there were ever such an event as Bloomberg News has claimed, we would be forthcoming about it and we would work closely with law enforcement. Apple engineers conduct regular and rigorous security screenings to ensure that our systems are safe. We know that security is an endless race and that\u2019s why we constantly fortify our systems against increasingly sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals who want to steal our data.\nThe published Businessweek story also claims that Apple \u201creported the incident to the FBI but kept details about what it had detected tightly held, even internally.\u201d In November 2017, after we had first been presented with this allegation, we provided the following information to Bloomberg as part of a lengthy and detailed, on-the-record response. It first addresses their reporters\u2019 unsubstantiated claims about a supposed internal investigation:\nDespite numerous discussions across multiple teams and organizations, no one at Apple has ever heard of this investigation. Businessweek has refused to provide us with any information to track down the supposed proceedings or findings. Nor have they demonstrated any understanding of the standard procedures which were supposedly circumvented.\u00a0\nNo one from Apple ever reached out to the FBI about anything like this, and we have never heard from the FBI about an investigation of this kind \u2014 much less tried to restrict it.\u00a0\nIn an appearance this morning on Bloomberg Television, reporter Jordan Robertson made further claims about the supposed discovery of malicious chips, saying, \u201cIn Apple\u2019s case, our understanding is it was a random spot check of some problematic servers that led to this detection.\u201d\nAs we have previously informed Bloomberg, this is completely untrue. Apple has never found malicious chips in our servers.\nFinally, in response to questions we have received from other news organizations since Businessweek published its story, we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2018-10-04T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

It uses a special virtual eSIM rather than a second physical SIM card (check your carrier for details).\nWe don't know exactly when iOS 12.1 is going to hit, but right after Apple's event on Tuesday seems like a sensible bet.

{"title": "The 5-point iPhone XR review: How Apple walks the fine line of greatness", "content": "The 5-point iPhone XR review: How Apple walks the fine line of greatness\nOctober 27, 2018 6:15 AM\nAbove: iPhone XR\nImage Credit: Jeremy Horwitz / VentureBeat\nMOST READ\nGamesBeat Summit: Apr. 23 - 24\nTransform: Jul. 10 - 11\nWhen Apple packs its most expensive iPhone with all the latest innovations, it\u2019s hard for anyone to get excited about the next step down the line. So after September\u2019s debut of the $999 iPhone XS and $1,099 iPhone XS Max , no one was shocked that the more affordable iPhone XR\u2019s late October launch didn\u2019t feature throngs of queued-up customers or local news crews \u2014 it\u2019s technically not Apple\u2019s 2018 flagship product.\nDespite the lack of lines, it\u2019s safe to say that millions of people are considering iPhone XR purchases. Apple has blurred the definition of \u201cflagship\u201d this year in a new way, creating a two-phone \u201cpremium flagship\u201d tier with the XS models, and a more traditional flagship in the $749 iPhone XR.\u00a0Having previously made the mistake of wrapping\u00a0last year\u2019s components in a shiny new package, Apple instead made the iPhone XR so close to the iPhone XS and XS Max that it could almost fit between them rather than under them.\nOn paper, the iPhone XR and XS differences are conspicuous: It\u2019s made from\u00a0aluminum rather than steel, uses an LCD screen rather than OLED, and has one rear camera rather than two. But in reality, the phones are hard to tell apart other than the XR\u2019s middle-of-road size and wider collection of color options. Since Apple put its latest processor and camera features into all of the XR and XS phones, they\u2019re more alike than different.\nAbove: Despite a $250 starting price difference, the iPhone XS (left) and iPhone XR (right) have far more in common than not.\nImage Credit: Jeremy Horwitz/VentureBeat\nThe resulting iPhone XR is a sweet-spot flagship phone that sits underneath two premium flagships in pricing, with a larger lineup of older devices beneath it as Apple\u2019s true midrange and low-end alternatives. Read on for the key details you need to know.\n1. The XR could have been called iPhone 9\nIf you\u2019ve seen the aluminum-framed iPhone 8 and the steel-framed iPhone X, you\u2019ll instantly understand how the iPhone XR could have been called iPhone 9 \u2014 physically, it\u2019s squarely in the middle of them. While the back and sides are substantially similar to the iPhone 8\u2019s, the notched-screen front looks virtually indistinguishable from the iPhone X.\nThat means you lose the Home button in favor of a fully swipe-based interface, a change that I personally found very easy to learn and \u2014 apart from the absence of Touch ID authentication \u2014 strongly prefer over the prior design. As was the case with the iPhone X, eliminating the button and creating a notch for camera, speaker, and sensor hardware enabled Apple to fill more of the front with screen real estate.\nOn the iPhone XR, the remaining\u00a0black bezel is perhaps 2mm thicker on the sides and bottom than on the X and XS, but its screen is over 7mm larger on the diagonal, so the difference isn\u2019t obvious in daily use. The top notch is indistinguishable in size to the ones found on the iPhone X, XS, and XS Max, cutting out a segment of the display while leaving small nooks for the time and status indicators.\nSince it looks half like an iPhone 8 and half like an iPhone X, why not call it the iPhone 9? External similarities aside, the iPhone XR is actually a step beyond the iPhone X internally, and Apple hopes the prospect of a more affordable iPhone X will win over price-sensitive Android customers. Even so, it needed to distinguish the less expensive\u00a0model as a step down from the simultaneously announced iPhone XS, so it went with a letter one lower in the alphabet, which happens to jibe with automotive and camera branding.\nIt also decided to go with just one iPhone XR size rather than the two sizes offered in the iPhone 6, 6s, 7, and 8 lineups.\u00a0This change makes it extremely easy for a customer to choose an iPhone XR \u2014 just go with the color and capacity you like, rather than fretting about screen size \u2014 but robs you of the chance to pick a smaller or larger screen size.\nAs a result, iPhone XR has only one screen option: a 6.1-inch LCD touchscreen. To get a major question out of the way up front: NO, you are not going to notice any huge difference \u2014 or probably even a small one \u2014 between the resolutions of Apple\u2019s best-of-class \u201cLiquid Retina\u201d LCD and best-of-class \u201cSuper Retina\u201d OLED screens. The iPhone XR\u2019s pixels are too small to be seen individually by the unaided human eye, and though the XS models technically have more pixels, the distinction is arguably meaningless.\nAbove: The iPhone XR sits between the iPhone XS (left) and an iPhone 7 Plus (right).\nImage Credit: Jeremy Horwitz / VentureBeat\nThat having been said, there are small differences in brightness and contrast between the OLED and LCD screens, though they will not practically matter for most people. Viewed straight on, the XR\u2019s screen looks just a hint brighter at its peak than the XS and XS Max, but the difference disappears when the screen\u2019s viewed off-angle.\nAbove: Reds and yellows are a little more saturated on the iPhone XR screen than the iPhone XS.\nImage Credit: Jeremy Horwitz/VentureBeat\nSimilarly, the OLED screens\u2019 blacks are a bit darker than the XR\u2019s, but not in a way that will be noticed by 97 percent of users. Color rendition is for the most part identical, though the XR\u2019s screen appears to have somewhat more saturated reds and yellows.\nPeople will actually notice the differences in iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max screen sizes, though again, they may not care about them. In raw pixel count, the XR\u2019s 6.1-inch display has a 1,792 by 828 resolution, which sounds like a lot fewer pixels than the 2,688 by 1,242 resolution of the XS Max\u2019s 6.5-inch display. But the XS Max\u2019s numbers are inflated because the OLED screen uses more dots to represent each pixel.\nIn reality,\u00a0the iPhone XR effectively squeezes the same user interface of the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max into a frame that\u2019s only a little larger than the 5.8-inch iPhone XS. You\u2019re actually able to toggle Display Zoom in the settings mode between filling the 6.1-inch screen with either Standard (XS Max) or Zoomed (XS) content, a difference that is subtle in practice. It\u2019s hard to notice on the Home screen, but when you\u2019re reading web pages or using other apps, more text and pictures fit on the XR\u2019s display.\nApple\u2019s decision to treat the XR like the XS Max gives the XR a surprising feature advantage over the smaller XS. When the XS rotates into landscape mode, Apple apps don\u2019t split the 5.8-inch screen into left and right panes, a feature that was previously exclusive to iPhone \u201cPlus\u201d models. But the split-pane feature is offered on the bigger screens of both the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone XR.\nThe XR also comes with 12 exclusive wallpapers \u2014 photos of bubbles in various colors \u2014 and the same black-backgrounded dynamic wallpapers that debuted on the iPhone X. But the iPhone XR lacks the iPhone XS\u2019s Live wallpapers, a series of animated bubbles.\nThat\u2019s because the iPhone XR\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t have 3D Touch support, the pressure-sensitive \u201cpush harder on the screen\u201d\u00a0feature Apple introduced in earlier iPhones. In the years I\u2019ve had access to it, I\u2019ve used 3D Touch only a few times each year due to mediocre software implementation, and at this point I wouldn\u2019t miss it if it disappears from every iPhone.\nInstead, the XR has Haptic Touch, a quasi-replacement that only works with a handful of buttons (camera, flashlight) and neither activates the Lock Screen\u2019s Live wallpaper nor triggers Home Screen shortcuts. Instead of a \u201cthump\u201d haptic to acknowledge a deep finger press, you just get a light confirmation tap when holding your finger an extra split-second on the screen. It\u2019s not as useful or impressive as 3D Touch, but unless you extensively used icon-based shortcuts, you\u2019re not going to notice.\nFrom my perspective, the only factor that will turn off some people \u2014 specifically, users with smaller hands or pockets \u2014 is whether the iPhone XR is too big. If you thought the iPhone 6, 6s, 7, or 8 was too large, sorry; there\u2019s nothing smaller in Apple\u2019s lineup any more. Having split the difference between Apple\u2019s regular and plus sizes, the iPhone XR is a pretty large phone. If you\u2019re in the camp that\u2019s been holding out for something more pocket-friendly, you\u2019ll have to keep waiting.\n2. Six color options and three capacities\nFive years ago, Apple introduced the iPhone 5c \u2014 a repackaged iPhone 5 sold in one\u2019s choice of five plastic shells \u2014 and thankfully, it learned a lot from that experience. Although it wasn\u2019t much less expensive than the iPhone 5 it replaced, the iPhone 5c was quickly tagged as \u201ccheap\u201d and somewhat downmarket for Apple. Though some of the 5c\u2019s middling color DNA is still evident in the iPhone XR, that\u2019s pretty much the only thing this year\u2019s \u201caffordable\u201d model has in common with its distant relative.\nThere\u2019s nothing plasticky or cheap about the iPhone XR; instead, the all glass and aluminum housing is a small step forward from the iPhone 8 models, and it looks all but indistinguishable from a matte-finished iPhone X or XS. Except for a white model with a silver frame, Apple has colored the 7000-series aluminum to match whichever brighter color you choose for the rear glass. The light blue model I tested has an even lighter metal tint than I\u2019d anticipated.\nBy contrast with the iPhone 5c, which was surprisingly hard to damage, the iPhone XR carries the same shatter and dent risks as most of its glass-and-metal predecessors. Apple has fortified the front glass somewhat to improve XR\u2019s drop resilience, though the jury\u2019s still out on how much better it will actually perform \u2014 no matter what Apple has said in the past about glass improvements, iPhones generally aren\u2019t great at withstanding drops. Since the rear glass remains fairly easy to break, purchasing a drop-safe case is highly advisable.\nApple\u2019s choice of iPhone 5c colors was mostly wan: plain white, meh pink, milquetoast blue, pale yellow, and neon green. The strongest of those colors, green, is gone in the new iPhone XR lineup, but the yellow, blue, and \u201ccoral\u201d pink are modestly more saturated. Just like the iPhone 5c, I personally wasn\u2019t thrilled with any of the new colors; they\u2019re too mild, and\u00a0don\u2019t reach the technicolor heights of the iPod nano at its \u201cnano-chromatic\u201d peak.\nBut they\u2019re thankfully accompanied by strong red, bright white, and dark black options that are each very nice \u2014 each highly similar to last year\u2019s iPhone 8 versions. Thanks to these more common choices, there are enough options in the iPhone XR lineup to satisfy almost anyone.\nA choice of capacities is the other important decision confronting new iPhone XR owners: 64GB ($749), 128GB ($799), or 256GB ($899) options come in $50 to $100 steps. You\u2019ll have to pick the size that\u2019s right for your needs, but the 128GB model strikes me as the best value this year. There\u2019s no 128GB version of the iPhone XS, forcing customers to pay a steeper $100 premium to upgrade from the 64GB base model.\n3. CPU, wireless and battery performance\nInternally, the iPhone XR is substantially similar to the iPhone XS, sporting the same A12 Bionic CPU and GPU chip with 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) and Bluetooth 5.0 wireless support. Spec sheets suggest that the iPhone XR offers 2018-caliber horsepower that under most circumstances is indistinguishable from the iPhone XS.\nGeekbench testing bears this out. The numbers for the XS and XR come out basically the same across multiple tests, with insignificant variations that in any case place the iPhone XR well above the performance of last year\u2019s iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X. Benchmark scores for single-core (4818) and multi-core (11461) performance place this pocket-sized phone in the same league as a low-end laptop, with all the same graphics, AI, and AR horsepower discussed in our iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max review .\nThere are a few differences between the iPhone XR and iPhone XS, though. Whether they will matter to you depends on how much you use your phone each day, and how long you intend to keep your phone.\nApple\u2019s devices don\u2019t struggle with RAM like Android phones, and Apple stubbornly refuses to include more RAM than a device needs. Since the XR\u2019s screen has fewer pixels to power than the XS or XS Max, it has 3GB of RAM (2.75GB usable) \u2014 the same as iPhone X \u2014 instead of the XS\u2019s 4GB (3.67GB usable). You\u2019re unlikely to notice this difference for now, but if iOS keeps growing larger, it might become meaningful in a couple years.\nOn the other hand, the iPhone XR has a larger battery than the iPhone XS and even last year\u2019s iPhone 8 Plus \u2014 a 2,942mAh cell with about 10 percent greater capacity.\u00a0Combined with screen and processor efficiencies, the XR promises up to 15 hours of internet use and 16 hours of video playback versus the XS\u2019 up to 12 hours of internet use and 14 hours of video playback \u2014 it even surpasses the iPhone XS Max by one to two hours. I\u2019ve found that the iPhone XS tends to fall short of last year\u2019s X on any given day, so if battery life matters to you, lean towards the XR.\nLast but not least, the iPhone XR\u2019s cellular support is a step behind the XS and XS Max, promising \u201cLTE Advanced\u201d rather than \u201cGigabit LTE\u201d cellular speeds. This is a confusing but important distinction between the devices \u2014 one that\u2019s worth understanding.\nThe iPhone XS and XS Max support the latest 4G/LTE cellular towers, which are theoretically capable of delivering 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) download speeds under specific conditions with certain carriers. By comparison,\u00a0the XR\u2019s top cellular speed is closer to 400 megabits per second (Mbps), like the iPhone X. If those numbers don\u2019t mean anything to you, bear two things in mind: Few people today have home internet service faster than 100Mbps, but in the next two years, many companies will be offering either home or cellular service at the 1Gbps level, with the promise of 5Gbps in the foreseeable future.\nWhen I tested the iPhone XS and iPhone XR side by side at the fastest cell towers I\u2019ve found in my area, both phones hit download peaks in the 150Mbps range \u2014 the iPhone XS hit 154Mbps on its best test, while the iPhone XR hit 150Mbps on one test and 158Mbps on another. Today, most users will find their performance to be virtually tied. But a year or two from now, more Gigabit LTE-capable towers will be in use across the world, and the XS will have the speed advantage.\n4. Camera and audio performance\nWhile there\u2019s plenty of potential for confusion when summing up the iPhone XR\u2019s cameras, I\u2019m going to cut right to the chase: Even though XR only has two cameras compared with XS\u2019s three, it is still a great point-and-shoot camera option. Apple has upgraded the XR\u2019s front-facing camera to \u201cTrueDepth,\u201d enabling it to be used for everything from Animoji and Memoji to portrait mode photography. And the rear-facing camera is faster and better than the iPhone 8\u2019s, as well.\nThe XR\u2019s\u00a0front camera is identical to what\u2019s inside the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max: a 7-megapixel, fast-lensed (f/2.2) camera with a depth-sensor and software-stabilized 1080p video recording. When taking selfies, you can expect the same wider field of view, Smart HDR support, and low light performance noted in my iPhone XS review.\nI saw no meaningful difference between front-facing shots taken with the XR and XS. Additionally, the XR\u2019s front camera is capable of being used for Face ID biometric authentication, introduced in the iPhone X last year, and has the same slightly faster response times found in the iPhone XS. This year\u2019s improvement of the Face ID feature brings it closer to feeling like a 1:1 replacement for Touch ID, though it\u2019s still not quite there in responsiveness.\nThe rear camera\u00a0is where things become more complicated. It\u2019s the same as the iPhone XS\u2019s \u201c1X\u201d wide-angle camera: a 12-megapixel, even faster-lensed (f/1.8) imager with optical and software stabilization, plus 4K video recording with up to 60fps support. For daytime photography and videography, you can expect the XR\u2019s results to be identical to an XS using only its 1X lens \u2014 including various subtle and meaningful improvements that make photographs look the best they\u2019ve ever looked on iPhones.\nSomewhat unfortunately, Apple has differentiated the XR from the XS by yanking the latter\u2019s \u201c2X\u201d telephoto lens, which is slower (f/2.4) but gives the XS and XS Max an optical zoom capability. The completely unedited, color-unadjusted photo below shows exactly what that means in practice: You lose the one-tap ability to fill your frame with a crystal-clear object in the distance, as well as the instantly optimized color correction that tap automatically includes.\nFor now, losing 2X support is the XR\u2019s only major downside compared with the XS. If you\u2019re interested in using Portrait Mode, it\u2019s still there: the XR uses actual depth data when it\u2019s taking pictures with the front camera and a software trick to estimate 3D depth for the rear camera. The bad news is that XR can only use this trick to estimate depth for faces, not objects, which means you won\u2019t be able to do as much with the 3D Photos feature Facebook is currently rolling out.\nHowever, because the XR Portrait Mode uses the XR\u2019s fast f/1.8 \u201c1X\u201d lens rather than the XS\u2019s slower f/2.4 \u201c2X\u201d lens, XR can actually take better noticeably portrait pictures in dim lighting conditions; the faster, wider lens gathers a lot more light. While both the XR and XS Portrait Mode are quick to display a \u201cmore light required\u201d message in poor lighting conditions, the XR churns out an image that looks almost like late daylight, while the XS\u2019s \u201cportrait\u201d is dusky \u2014 almost to the point of pointlessness.\nIt would be great if Apple added a toggle to the iPhone XS to let users choose whether to rely on camera depth data or its XR software algorithm to capture low-light portrait shots, since the XR\u2019s results are better, and software\u2019s the only difference. Until and unless that happens, each camera will have separate strengths.\nSonically, the iPhone XR is on par with but not identical to the iPhone XS. Despite its larger physical size, its speakers perform audio at the same peak volume and with the same general sonic balance, though if you listen closely, the smaller XS has slightly cleaner bass and the XR has modestly more sibilant treble. Users of wireless headphones and speakers likely will notice no difference between the models.\n5. Pricing and conclusions\nBecause I actually buy iPhones rather than getting free Apple review units, my take on their pricing and affordability is different from those who rely initially or exclusively on loaners \u2014 for me, an iPhone is an investment of real money, and when prices go up or down, I feel it just like you do.\nFor that reason, I see the iPhone XR\u2019s \u201caffordable\u201d marketing as a matter of perspective. With a $749 starting price for 64GB, it is indeed substantially less expensive than the $999 64GB iPhone XS, but it\u2019s also $50 more than the starting price for last year\u2019s iPhone 8. That\u2019s certainly not cheap by any standard, as $749 could buy a premium phone from almost any vendor. And in typical Apple style, you\u2019ll have to spend a little more to get the \u201cjust right\u201d 128GB version.\nEven so, there\u2019s no question that the iPhone XR offers much better value for the dollar than the iPhone X, XS, or XS Max. Unlike the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which were priced only a little higher than the value of their components, Apple\u2019s prices for the X, XS, and Max \u2014 especially with extra RAM \u2014 are exorbitant, reaching levels that only wealthy customers and shareholders would find acceptable.\nWith the iPhone XR, Apple split the difference between iPhone 8 and 8 Plus prices, split the body size, and filled the middle-of-road chassis with as big a screen and as many modern components as it could muster. Consequently, there are so many upgrades in the iPhone XR that it would have been more worthy of skipping a numeral than the iPhone 8 was from the iPhone 7: a bigger screen, a TrueDepth front camera with Face ID, a faster and better rear camera, and the best mobile processor on the market, just to name a few.\nBecause Apple didn\u2019t repackage year-old hardware in a cheaper housing, the iPhone XR\u2019s inclusion of current-generation components makes it very easy to recommend to most people. Just like the iPhone XS, I would certainly not call it \u201cfuture-proof,\u201d particularly since much faster new phones are literally just around the corner. But assuming you can keep it in one piece, and accept its cellular speed limitations, the XS should last you a few years.\nThat having been said, several factors should weigh on your mind before purchasing the iPhone XR. First, Apple\u2019s decision to go with a size between its prior iPhone 8 and 8 Plus devices will make XR an uncomfortable fit in some pockets and hands. It may be the ideal size for people who found the Plus phones too big, but it\u2019s another step in the wrong direction for users who didn\u2019t want phones as big as the iPhone 6, 6s, 7, or 8, and leaned towards the now-discontinued iPhone SE instead. Whether that\u2019s an overall market trend or a fad, some people are certainly being left behind.\nThe second and third factors concern XR\u2019s real-world longevity. As Verizon and AT&T are just beginning to roll out 5G networks, buying any 4G phone right now is like buying an old-school Casio at the start of the smartwatch age \u2014 an investment that will seem technologically antiquated in the very foreseeable future. It doesn\u2019t help that Apple has made the XR from easily damaged glass and aluminum, which all but requires you to purchase a protective case.\nIf a family member or friend was shopping for a phone now and needed something right away, I would point right to the iPhone XR. For the price, it\u2019s a better choice than the iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max unless the 2X second rear lens or potential Gigabit LTE service found in XS models really appeals to you. But if you\u2019ve waited this long, consider holding out for next year, when early 5G phones have the prospect of delivering several years of even more impressive cellular performance. Because of 5G\u2019s rapid onset, you can be certain that gigantic cellular speed gains are just around the corner, even if it Apple won\u2019t be the first (or second, or third) to deliver them to customers.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2018-10-27T00:00:00Z", "images": []}

While the iPhone won over consumers, and the Watch is on a growing number of wrists, Apple is pushing content creation for its other major devices.\nThe main news on Tuesday will be revamped iPad Pros with Face ID and a new charging port, a new laptop destined to replace the aging MacBook Air, and a new Mac mini geared toward professional users, according to people familiar with the plans. They asked not to be identified discussing unannounced products. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nThe update to the iPad Pro will be the most significant in the product\u2019s history. The device was originally launched in 2015 in part as a counter-measure to Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Surface Pro, which gained a following with business users seeking large tablets with support for attachable keyboards and styluses. The iPad Pro models, which have larger screens, better cameras, and faster processors, are more expensive, which has sustained revenue growth.\nAlso read: New-gen Adobe Photoshop is coming to Apple\u2019s iPad\nThe iPad Pro update comes at an important time for the device, which hasn\u2019t been refreshed since mid-2017. While the tablet market is contracting overall, the iPad has been slowly regaining momentum thanks to new software and lower-priced models, but also because competitors like Amazon.com Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. haven\u2019t wowed the market lately.\nFor the Mac, Apple is planning its first wide-ranging upgrades since June 2017. The MacBook Air and Mac mini, a small desktop machine without a screen, have gone several years without notable changes. This, combined with interest in larger smartphones and competing PCs, led Apple to report the fewest Mac sales since 2010 in its fiscal third quarter.\n", "language": "en", "date": "2018-10-27T07:37:18Z", "images": []}

{"title": "Briefing: Microsoft Becomes Second Most Valuable Company ", "content": "\u00b7 Source: The Information\nApple, which has the biggest market capitalization in the world, is deservedly recognized as the greatest comeback in tech history. And now Microsoft, in passing Amazon on Friday to become the second most highly-valued public company, is clearly the runner-up for that title. The flip-flop occurred after investors punished Amazon for falling short of Wall Street sales estimates with its earnings report Thursday. Amazon\u2019s market cap on Friday was about $801 billion, while Microsoft\u2019s was $821 billion. Apple\u2019s is over $1 trillion.\nMicrosoft\u2019s renaissance gets far less public attention than Apple\u2019s, most likely because the key to its resurgence\u2014its success as a provider of cloud services\u2014has little of the glamor of iPhones, iPads and iTunes. While Microsoft lost its way for over a decade, it never had a near-death experience quite like that of Apple, which needed defibrillation in the late 1990s. Both companies were founded within a year of each other in the mid-1970s. A decade or two from now, a younger generation of tech companies\u2014Facebook, Google and Amazon\u2014may be struggling for their second acts too.\n1 Subscriber comment\nWhat Is The Information?\nIn-depth Journalism\nReceive out our latest exclusives, breaking news, interactive graphics and more in your inbox every morning.\nDaily Briefing\nEvery weeknight, we'll send you our views on the day's top tech news.\nConference Calls\nEach month, our reporters discuss trending tech topics in depth exclusively with our subscribers.\nExclusive Events\n", "language": "en", "date": "2018-10-26T17:58:40Z", "images": []}
